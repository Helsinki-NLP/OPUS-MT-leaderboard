European inflation has slipped on food.
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to a sustained increase in food prices.
The November price increase in 13 countries in the euro area was higher than expected, recorded annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent in October - reportedly the EU statistical office in Luxembourg.
The official forecast indicates only 3 percent - reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB) US, British and Canadian central banks, the basic mat could not be cut, saying that the reduction would lead to inflationary sparkles, together with rising commodity prices and low unemployment.
The ECB is under two percentage points, but it is likely to maintain the inflation rate close to that.
According to an analysis, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps, "to talk down" about inflation so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation in November is 3,3 per cent as a 12-year record; in Spain it has risen to 4,1 per cent from 3.6 to 3.6.
Europe-wide inflation was driven high by the rising food and energy prices.
The fixed quantities for wheat rose by 88 percent, and the soya bean exchange rate has reached its maximum value since 1973.
Also, food and milk products had to pay significantly more in 2007 than before.
The world oil market price went up by 52 per cent this year, and last month it cost nearly $100 a barrel of peacock.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 percent this year in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
However, it is expected that the ECB will reduce its interest rate twice during 2008 by two times.
The government crisis is facing the Gallup crisis.
The support circle of Fidesz has grown significantly at the beginning of December, so since 2002, it has been the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured this low, 13-percent socialist subsidy.
For the Commissioner's voters, the difference - because of the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two thirds (71 percent) of the MSZP's contribution to one fifth (20 percent) of its funding.
MDF and SZZZ are estimated to be below the national threshold: their total per capita allowance is two percent.
Among the Commissioner's voter party voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more than one percent more.
Economic interlocution can continue to be corrupt - it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be very bad, while the other 46 per cent considered the situation to be rather bad.
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are now more re-assessed after changing their financial situation.
For the following year, the majority of the population will expect further deterioration and only one tenth improvement.
In December, more than every previous survey of Gallup, 71 percent of the respondents thought that he was doing more wrong than the prime minister was doing well.
By the way, 13 percent of the questions either trust or trust, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the number of supporters.
54% at the Prime Minister's disposal, 27% at the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the political situation is the extent of society's belief that without a change of government, it will be possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.
While 35 percent of the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable after last October's riots, this ratio is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees only a solution in the resolution of new elections.
It is characteristic of the polling interest that 60 percent of the respondents answer the question of participation that they would definitely go and another 20 percent say they would probably leave.
As a comparison, in a "now-day parliamentary election", only 55 percent would participate and another 15 percent would consider it likely to take part, and the result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of current intentions.
74, 79, and 84 percent of people's fees for the hospital would say no to their fees, 84 percent to their fees and 84 percent to their daily hospital fees.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who are sure of their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would be deprived of the introduction of tuition fees, fees and hospital daily fees.
The most important of the Auchan, almost a fifth raised the Tesco on Tesco.
In the Budapest trade perspective, the hypermarks held a 16 percent price increase last year, on average, in terms of the fact that the VAT did not increase this year.
The Daily Economy Article
This year, on average, the daily Christmas basket increased by 16 percent in the Budapest trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase in value of over a thousand HUF.
Since last December the prices in the food trades were already "decreased", so a percentage of the previous high base was no longer seen to be a sharp drop in prices.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to receive under $2,000 last year is not yet available for 10,000.
The daily basket was crossed by at least 91 Forints in the hypermarket tested for ten thousand forints.
The maximum basket price was 10 573 HUF.
(In 2003 6.00 forints were put in the basket.)
Unicum and live fish prices almost remained at last year's level, but the turkey juice, walnut and mace have been greatly reduced.
KSH's data was followed in the store by the price of flour and bread, although in Aashan we found a kilo of bread for 139 forint.
Competition did not trace the product price below 200 Forints.
It was also surprising in this business that the double-litre reverse bottle Coca-Cla price was below 200 HUF, so with the deposit, only 2 Forints were requested for the product.
This year, however, the Auchan has shown the most precious in the daily basket, while the Cora is the cheapest in the world.
We estimate that Cora 15, compared to last year's Christmas price, and Tesco and Auchan increased prices by about 18-18 per cent in the daily basket.
Compared to last year's most expensive basket value, the difference was 12 per cent, while last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive is 21 per cent.
On average, there were 1480 growth rates on average.
Last year's average price increase was 1206 HUF, with the price increase having an effect on the price increase last time.
This is exactly the same process that has disrupted trade, apparently they could not decide how much margin to use for a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of a product is wrongly planned by the trader, there may be serious benefits in terms of the flow-intensive margin.)
As a result of the VAT, last year's increase in the price of the sun's basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive 1720 HUF was more than in 2006, while the price difference was only 844 HUF at the lowest.
This year, this extreme has not been revealed, since the current most expensive 1630 HUF was more than last year, and the cheapest one was also more expensive than the 12 April forint.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic increase in prices was seen, and in less than 20 months, daily consumer goods in hypermarkets were reduced by over 30 per cent over a period of less than 20 years.
(This does not necessarily justify the KSH data: the statistical office has measured price increases of more than 30 % in some basic foods over 12 months.
Like flour, for example, from the egg.)
According to the daily basket, this seems almost impossible, since last year's price level for a relatively expensive product has at least produced a price increase of less than 10 percent above the base compared to the base last year.
As far as flour suppliers are concerned, they seem to be in a stronger position than eggers, and the dramatic price level increase has been reversed on the multi.
In the face of trade, the hypers do not complain, the hypers do not complain, they report a good year on a regular basis.
According to our experience, in the three shops visited, the majority of customers no longer care about prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the long-term food to the ground.
Since the number of visitors has increased suddenly, there have been serious queues in all three stores since Wednesday morning.
However, we understand that traffic in the countryside is less expensive, that research companies complain more than once that even their plans for less revenue, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of long-term consumer products.
In many places, it saves money on disinfectants.
This year, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals that have occurred mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overload on staff are not in favour of stopping infections, claims the head of the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They also save money on anti-infectiouss in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the emergency department of the John's Hospital.
In a man who was in a serious accident, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been detected in a man who has been found to be in contact with antibiotics.
The patient was identified.
A similar reaction occurred at the beginning of the year.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection, and his major surgery was still unable to perform due to the bacteria in his system.
By 10 December this year, hospital infections caused by 1094 multi-responsive pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Böröcz Karolina, head of the head of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that so many multi-responsive pathogens have definitely been registered in hospitals, the rest of which is not known.
Approximately two-thirds (6°) of infections were caused by MRSA, i.e. the methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) into their noses without having to cause disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of throats, tonsils, skin infections, ulcers) are good at treating antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not adequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly resistant bacteria against antibiotics, which is rapidly spread in inappropriate hospital conditions.
In particular, in patients with transient or persistent poor functioning of the immune system, patients with impaired organ, elderly or low body weight may have serious medical conditions, such as ulceration or blood poisoning - septicaemia - in patients with reduced organ, elderly or low body weight.
According to the doctor at the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the disease, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where there is no examination of the presence of the pathogen.
Antibiotics are resistant to the effects of antibiotics.
"We provide patients like these, the nursing staff supplies the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
The patients who enter the hospital will be examined in advance for the presence of MRSA in their system, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
The sample is not fashionable.
While the vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, the current domestic hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs in hospitals, in old-age hospitals, hospitals should monitor the patients who are entering, and patients who have MRSA should be removed immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, there is no microbiological test in fashion.
This also means that the National Insurance Fund does not finance these investigations.
In most cases, this is the case when the patient becomes infected with MRSA, said the head of the head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are home directives to cure certain infections and pathogens.
An attempt should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but the hospitals do not follow this in any case.
Microbiological surveys are even less rare in the supply of sick or basic care, reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Saving savings on disinfectants.
Scientific evidence indicates that MRSA is spread from one patient to the other most frequently through the supply of healthcare personnel.
This is why the use of hand washes, gloves, mask has a very important role to play, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitalisation.
MRSA is infected with infection, contact, but under domestic circumstances it is not always possible to separate the infected patient from the infected patient.
In fact, the hospitals are often crowded, often the beds are very close to each other, whereas, from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart from each other.
On the other hand, it is also evident that Karolina Böröcz notes that in the hospitals in poor financial conditions they save money on disinfectants, not enough nurses, many patients, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is evidence of less such an infection or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
The Government of the Government against MRSSA is the Government of the Government.
The management of MRSA infection is a huge cost to health insurance companies, so they are fighting against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
The programme seems to have been successful, based on the data provided, the MRSA infections appear to be a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include the development of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such agents.
There was no drunk officer in charge of the death accident.
An official expert opinion was adopted on the fatal accident caused by Commissioner XXII.
There is no way that in a drunk or blatant state, he would have been in the position of the temporarily resigned Commissioner of District XXIII, who threw an alien to death, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the B.C.A., on Friday after the opinion of the expert on this matter has been drawn up.
The opinion was based on the primary study result, which already found that the former chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then driver of the district of XXII hit the 55-year-old man on Tuesday during the turn of his own passenger car in Kossuth Louis Street, XXII, who did not want to cross the road to the designated end of the road.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian is not passing through the zebra, under the rules of the KRESZ, must still give priority to the krona-riding car.)
The pedestrian lost his life after the delivery of the meat.
As a result of what happened, the D.A.'s chief of police resigned from his post and asked for him to be put in custody, the police reported that he was so shocked by the incident.
The case with the Budapest D.A. is under investigation.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former chief of police was involved in the initials in cooperation with the prosecutors involved in the investigation.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure.
Three loans worth EUR 400 million, supporting education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy, were signed by János Veres Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million for the financing of transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Fund, of which 100 million credit agreements have already been signed by the parties, for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also serves as a financial contribution for education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million being used later, with the extension of the loan.
In the field of innovation, a 50 million-euro contract was signed by the parties, which is used primarily by the budget for the University of Debrecen’s research and development project.
The 4th metro was also discussed at the meeting.
It is agreed that when Hungary completes the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it will return to the need for and how to amend the original contract.
According to Jure Veres, this will happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan portfolio shall provide the EIB with the EURIBOR with an eight-year extension period and with no maintenance fee.
Union Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe is looking at a few of the recently mentioned Balkan countries.
What, where and who buys the EU still at the cheapest but fast-responsive market?
Analysis of Re/Max Bulgarian division.
The most up-to-date real estate purchase in Eastern Europe is now definitely Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and coastal houses.
The most beautiful Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions are between the mountains, and Albena on the beach, Arany Beach, Napos Beach, Ancient Sozopol and Nessa, but more and more people are looking for property in the neighborhoods of Kavarna and Balchik.
Analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria believe that sooner or later, the central part of the country will also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more people are buying in the particularly cheap Russ as well.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive opportunities to talk, commercial and office spaces to ensure the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to summer and winter seasons, it will be a priority destination for the other two seasons.
Predictor investors are therefore already buying large quantities, such as in Banszko.
Analysts believe that the purchase of real estate in Bulgaria is also trying to change their life and lifestyle.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from Denmark, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Spain.
In Malta and Cyprus, investors are also present, while in the Black Sea and in the ski tomatoes, many Russians are traditionally the customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three categories: Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max.
The settlers or refurbished properties buy between EUR 50 and EUR 100 000 or stunned old houses for between EUR 5 and 15 thousand and are refurbished.
The need for good accessibility and communication opportunities is important to him is the proximity of a capital city, shops and a local doctor in general.
The second category is for the retailers (Bulgaria entered the first 10 German destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who are buying in the hope of medium to long-term value growth.
The decline in capital real estate is continuing as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, the lowest prices of real estate in the European Union are the lowest, but in the last five years they have increased by 21 percent in the year.
The rise in property prices is essentially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian percent of the Hungarian percent
According to the information provided by the Minister for Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and, on Wednesday following the official opening, the negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue with ministers.
Experts and politicians from the 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which includes efforts following the emission reduction period decided by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently under intense discussion between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not wish to address accurate figures at present, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question is whether developed countries, in addition to reducing emissions, will also be willing to provide both financial and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
There have also been agreements on aid to developing countries.
The grant fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by 16 members of the Governing Board, expected to be read within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) in Market and Profit.
Hungary six per cent
Mr Fodor Gábor Minister for Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain the flagship's role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 Convention, and will be ready to reduce by up to 30 per cent if other major developing regions of the world and developing countries, as well as developing countries, are willing to commit themselves to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Mr Fodor pointed out that in 1997 a total reduction of 5.2 per cent was set for the Kyoto Protocol countries, including the EU - then 15 Member States - minus 8 per cent.
The Hungarian obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period 1985-87, which we will achieve. - recalls the Environment Department's public statement.
The stake is high in Bali, because within two years the long-term international climate agreement should be covered, otherwise its entry into force would be until 2012; in this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the new international emission reduction system, the need for which was pointed out in the latest report of the International Panel on Climate Change of the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize, the UN Nobel Peace Prize.
This emission reduction would be delayed and inevitable in the increase of global temperature above 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
There's a British firm recruiting on YouTube.
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are published on the video dealer by the United Kingdom’s units that promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) got to YouTube: Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been downloading videos of their Taliban operations since March 2006 - reported BBC.
These recordings with a mini-machine camera fitted with helmets will be checked at the Air Force Military Commander, then sent to London, where the domestics will upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
The air force's soldiers have already recorded 139 footage on the Internet in this form, and their "channels" were viewed for more than 75 thousand.
The British Ministry of Defence registered under the name "defencehead quarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Defence Forces (MNF) also have their own YouTube network.
Introduced in Afghanistan.
According to the Air Force's original intention, it was to recruit the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence in the general public.
The propaganda published in such a form is almost nothing compared to the traditional recruitment announcements - said Mackenzie, the Defence Officer of the BBC, - but he will also send some political messages as well, as it shows in a specific form the existence of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans were playing games with Americans.
The army also has problems with the introduction of third-party videos, in addition to carefully written censured recordings, to the dealer, which, for example, shows the death of the soldier: in the 'public' propaganda films, the officers talk about losses at the maximum, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
Otherwise, a number of videos of the war scene in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released from the Internet, which were ready for direct deployment, but the British army has only recently been able to find out.
The Americans are recruiting a shooting game called America's Army, which is a little different, free downloadable, in which the player can hide directly into the soldiers' skin in a more or less life-like simulation.
There's gonna be a dusting and bobling fire at the Ministrys.
Minister Lamperth Mónika for Labour does not seem to be advocating: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a year-long work meeting for his colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye with pogacha and coffee from 2007.
There is a Ministry where there is going to be a live music party, and elsewhere else they're going to create a Christmas spirit in the heart of the officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and dinner table - so the power is fun.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest ministerial Christmas party is held this year by the defence warehouse, but the HM is not looking for a military employee.
At the Christmas of the Arájak, children of the fallen soldiers receive a gift, family members of the soldiers in the current foreign branches are invited at the Mission Christmas, but also a public reception.
The wallet is worth 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFE) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GNP) fires money in relation to other cases.
The GKM party will be held in the future house, with a total of 4 320 000 HUF, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the 200 state-of-the-art staff.
At the feast of the wallet, they will insist on the Christmas atmosphere, but performers will also take place and there will be a scandal.
The U.S.O.O. was held on Wednesday - concerts and dinners at the National Judicial Council (OIT) building.
The rent cost a million HUF, the remaining part was spent on more than 400 guests.
We understand that one department of the U.S.A. is also due for another Christmas celebration: this is settled by a tendering company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU money.
The Vígszínház building was rented for the purpose.
The information at MAG Zrt has not been confirmed because we have not been able to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building is not only a guest of the NFE, but also of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca Day ball on December 7th instead of December 7.
They did not ask for any money to use OIT's rooms.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the Minister's welcome and was able to dance after dinner.
The [orgo] question was asked: the ball was not obliged to wear any other dress or suit at all.
The health, labour and municipal wallets will be held at a party in Prague.
The Department of Health organises a show and a ceremony for employees for HUF 40,000.
On the other hand, the Minister for Labour, Mr Lamperth Mónika, officially waits for his staff not only for a Christmas party but also for an annual end-of-year work meeting.
They're expecting a hundred and eight guests, who - reported to the press - will only get coffee and pagasy, so the party will be removed from HUF 350 000.
On the other hand, Minister of State Bajnai Gordon will simply coccine with his colleagues in the honor of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting in its own large room for 436 workers.
Each year, 2500 forints are dedicated to the Christmas party - the sum of which is a dinner reception and a cocktail.
Ever since János Veres the Minister, each year, the employees of the PM have been on fire every year.
However, there will be no brunch, and the post will be confirmed not only by the Ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon date.
The agricultural warehouse will give a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadvár, the Városliget, and according to the wallet, each 100 guests will receive 1000 HUF each.
This, according to the press, will be a very simple reception, which only the foreign professional diplomas accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual bets begin with a short-term welcome and end with repressed snacks.
There is no Christmas party at all between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - they have informed [orgo] about the main media departments.
The price of the office Christmas of the base case could not be reported in the press.
At any rate, more than 400 people were invited to the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Artists.
The forces of the giants are gathering all the time.
On Friday, their strike committee coordinating Monday's unsolved strike will be set up by the League Trade Unions and the National Labour Councils.
A large Saturday protesting assembly will be held on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - and the job pay begins.
Action in the transport sector will certainly cause significant aggravation, as rail transport will almost stop completely, and they will strike for 13 hours at BKV.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present details of Monday's strike organised jointly with the National Union of Works Councils.
There will also be a league committee, which will carry out Monday’s actions.
A large Saturday protesting assembly will be held, and on Monday, the strike-related organizations will cancel the work without a decision if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been specified - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of completion of the initial strike.
If the Parliament does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
On the other hand, if the legislation is voted on, the committees will meet and decide to proceed.
According to the parliamentary agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted on late in the evening in the evening in the evening in the afternoon in the afternoon in the afternoon.
As a result of the strike starting on Monday you can expect significant back-up in transport: you can stop working at the railway for an indefinite period, then you can stop part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volan Republics.
At the same time, there will also be a semi-track roadblock in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs have joined the strike call, and their list is kept up to date on the League Day.
Each of these organisations has declared strike for an indefinite period, other temporary job breaks have been announced.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union between MÁV and the Railways Trade Union (VTSZ) could not agree on a happy service, although more and more people are travelling by rail as Christmas holidays approach.
It has been reported that BKV is being launched from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., four hours of strike is being held by the Liga Electric and Heat Industry Trade Unions, 2 and 2 hours of employment has been called upon by the Pedagogian Trade Union and by the Democratic Union of Paediatrics.
The Hungarian Federation is in a country, on changed dates, holding a two-hour warning strike by the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the SZEF Health and Social Sector (EDSZ) of the Republic of Hungary.
The four main elements of the League are that the government withdraws the proposal for a reform of health insurance and that a new concept be given to social debate.
The second is to gradually introduce the new method of calculation of pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement can be introduced into the system before 2010.
The main reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (STA) of the League Trade Union does not accept the economic and transport department's offer of rail guidelines and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded in August this year, have raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in a number of respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company's "risk warnings" said that the most important political risk in the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "with the shock of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Hungarian Gypsy and non-Gypsy population, even violent ethnic clashes may arise in the long term".
The reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be designed to provoke such an act - the research institute added it to it.
As stated, this is due to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate on the Roma was handed over by public actors to representatives of radical and extreme political groups, who could build a political strategy for the opposite of Gypsy-Hungarian".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremes and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have been "seriously undermined by the high level of domestic and international media attention", particularly in relation to the belief in the country's stability and democratic development.
It is recalled that the renewal of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary, which received increasing publicity and impetus from the autumn of 2006, is part of the fact that more and more organisations, known as the "national self-defence" association themselves, have been established in Hungary since summer 2007.
"The common definition of themselves as a civil society is a common feature of these consolidations, when they openly announce the preparation of their members, whether they are armed, for protection (catastrophe, defence, law enforcement), and also for the police, the army, or the State's misfortune".
He noted: this is done in accordance with a method which, based on the political and reciprocity of society, seeks to put various political aspirations into civil clothing.
The opinion of the population and the form of association are therefore not merely to avoid legal finding out about the legal basis of the legal registration for such associations, but also to avoid a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor for the neighbourhood.
"In recent months, several neighbouring countries have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and some of the neighbouring countries' ultra-national political actors are seeking to prove their own Hungarian policies by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the region's political stability," he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, thus increasing political risks for the whole region.
As stated, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union for the Probest Right (BNU) in August 2007.
In the context of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass-enhanced ravages that have been erupted in one of the areas of Sofia (Crazna Poljan) in the area of Sofia.
BNU has decided to set up a garage, saying that the organisation aims at "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a "Cyányterror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained ineffective and indifferent - reminds the Political Capital.
He added: the initiative had a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that resistance is likely to create their own barrier.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Gárda shows similarities to the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat by organising their own self-defence - the political capital's risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, for the interest of the telegram office, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk assessment every year, and if they experience any experience that may have an impact on the change of risk, they shall inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is a red letter for the holiday.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the days of the first letter, and around the holidays, the day-to-day restructuring has become a general practice, with fewer days to come.
There is no single holiday in the EU and in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and working days.
Working days are mostly linked to church holidays and remarkable historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last and the first day of the year - the last and the new day of the year - the last one of them is to get some rest from the new year.
All year round, we have 11 digit holidays.
The National Holiday is the Memorial of the Revolution of 18 April and 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, we will celebrate the foundation of the state, celebrate the work on 1 May, remember our relatives and friends who died on 1 and 2 November.
There is also a two-day feast of meat, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are on the calendar on a rare basis this weekend, it has become a practice to transfer the working day in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the first letter holiday.
True, the price of the extended weekend is that we will not be absent from work-school on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or following the anniversary is exactly when it should be worked out has been regulated by the Minister of Labour for a long period of years in a separate regulation by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation covers all employers and employees employed by them, civil servants and civil servants alike.
However, it does not affect service companies or institutions operating without interruption and operating on working days due to their destination.
This year, only around the end of the year is the agenda: from 24 December, life in the country is almost over, as experience has shown that the days between Christmas and New Years are "slided down" by most people, or use saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, more holiday is due to take place in the middle of the week or end, so there will be less job transfer than this year.
The first working day will change the calendar so that workers can stay at home for four days depending on the same time.
On Tuesday, 26 April, it will be a working day in exchange for a Friday on May 2nd.
The other transfer is due to the ceremony on 23 October: on 18 October, on Saturday, we will have to work instead of the 24th Friday.
The end of the year, however, can come at full notice next year, since almost every day from December 24th, there will be a nonstop break even if New Year's Eve is due Wednesday.
Six escalating little things to upset your colleagues.
E-mails that we refuse to send are voicemail messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost miss: these "paint" everyday at work.
Ask yourself, ‘ Do I get used to a little trouble or wear the gloves and knowingly avoid the misunderstandings that cause revenge to others? ’
Tips.
"Bos, I'll forget to tell you that you were looking for me at the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting?
If you feel guilty and try to make amends, you may call the marketing class to tell you not to deliver the message (this is a less than normal solution).
Most of the time it's done with an invitation.
In the event of an embarrassing asylum, it is worth considering what you can do to make minutes for your colleagues, and to try deliberately to avoid this.
Can you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, an ID or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Do you realize that last night you put your fire extinguisher on the table, but in the morning, he was legging?
Perhaps you would like to reveal on the record of one of your colleagues your pens considered to be lost?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be angry with you to ride their property.
Don't put your head at the office envelopes, post-it, 'cause it might be a shame if you run out of time and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' privacy?
There is no good way to stop the rumor that is already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Why?
Don't tie your notifications (indications) of your colleagues' privacy to everyone's face.
If one of them shares your most intimate secrets with you, don't get back on your trust.
Bury your hearings in yourself, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about what your colleagues have done to you.
Do you mean "indocantoly" who?
When you call the office and point out that you're a sick person because you're feeling bad or feel like you're resting that day; think about your job, your work, your work to be deferred, your work to be done by someone else for you.
Don't spot me with your co-workers.
If you know you're not going to the office the next day or you're going to have to do something to stay home for, tell your colleagues and your boss not to face you in the next day.
Singing, whining, ringing, making a phone call.
Did you get involved in the work, but it's a lot to drag your colleagues out of?
Were you an unwitting witness to a phone call that would have been better off not to hear?
Don't bother your colleagues with a banging, walking, loud conversation (which you continue under their heads), footing, constant debauchery, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they are not in the process of getting into a project (writing, planning, organisation).
Do you blame anyone else for the fault?
If something is wrong with time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don't blame anything else for your forgetfulness.
Don't be referring in the office to possible reigning chaos, your loud colleagues.
Just admit it if you're wrong, and it's the opposite of what's left of it, and you're gonna have to get rid of the herd.
Ask me how you can make up for your mistake and make up for your failure.
Are you feeling too comfortable in the office?
Pantyhose and slippers: comfortable dress for home, but not for the office.
Don't wear any comfortable outdoors suit if your job is allowed.
Don't be a ramp, your colleagues, and respect yourself for going into the office in normal clothes - if your job is done, gently, elegantly - you go into the office.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
A discount on the car in the usual lunch traffic.
There is a special tune from the outside: the sound of a violin to which electronic efficiencies are associated.
I'm going to roll up the volume.
The music has become a speed and the bass comes to the former sound colors, and then there's a women's story as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love's number is on mr.2.
For a long time, our home music life has not spoiled us with a high quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like there's something different about the plug while you're listening to the new disk disk.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions coming from the digital underground home are gradually changing in the same way, and even though fashion is refurbished in the guitar garage rock, the domestic electrictrop also proves that there is new under the Day.
Balázs Zõszer started from Pécs, and you were in Yonderboi's orchestra as long as - maybe, because two cocks didn't get along in a culder - you went on your own trip.
With his driver (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic music, pop elements, but it started to break through when he asked for film soundtracks to be combined (e.g.
Turkish Zone).
The formations of the smaller clubs initially were seen by a wider audience when the wanna2 magazine first album in 2002 was ranked among the 50 most important domestic albums, and Zagar, with Yonderboi's company, was called out to be the only domestic trend-makers that seemed to be marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and the band became "trendical", but of course no one asked them if they wanted to wear the label.
The orchestra reacted as it should: it made a new, better record.
The album, which has just appeared in Canno Walk Fly Instead, can open up new routes for them, although the address itself wishes to create a universe with the early pre-Pench years.
That was one of the lines of an old orchestra in Zõszer, there.
We would be on a flying flight reference, but we have just noticed - according to the spirit, trend of the age - the sounder guitar, the rock and the role of the rock, along with the fairness of music.
In these songs, the album's premiere is currently shown by the singer György Ligeti, who works with The Puzzle orchestra in England.
The album also produced a true radio tag, the newest Mr.2 Petőfi, playing popular music from this morning to tonight, began to smuggle the songs of Wings of Love into the ears of six Hungarian singers (the Underground Divas).
So it's okay.
The hvg.hu Zõszer, the so-called "Churt of the Zõszer", was asked by the so-called "Major of the Högg.hu".
hvg.hu: With this new tag, you are now asking the question: How much is left of the music you play?
Balázs Győser: The definition of a layer of music, it doesn't matter to me very much.
I think there are two kinds of easy music caste; it's not about stream and underground, it's not about alternative and pop, it's about comedy and sincere.
The so-called alternative underground music can also be flat, nothing to say and can be prepared for mere sale, which makes them communion.
But a good pop can give you an honest boost.
The host attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the audience of Hungarian and foreign audiences with regard to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreignly, especially from us, there are more traditions of light music.
There are not only concerts of the age of 16, but also older ones.
They are more closely monitoring the changes in the music around them because it is also held in the culture of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not for our sake, but for some reason.
The audience's role is more visible in concerts, where each other's influence is already active, but it only lies in the invisible changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the audience, you wouldn't care from that point on.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works in a solo, and he built his career further away from us.
Zs.B.: We don't really go his way, regardless of the fact that sometimes people try to get this into our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts in another musical presence and lets it get out of hand.
At first, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi's music, since many of us were born from his orchestra and left another way.
hvg.hu: On the front page of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love has become the first place on the front page of Mr.2 Petőfi.
Many people first heard the name Zagar for this number.
Are you consciously open to a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a label and then sell the disk.
This is about more than that.
It was meant to be the final of the album, which we tried to unlock the tone of the volume and the most difficult subjects on the album.
hüg.hu: How did you choose the six singeress?
Why are they - what was the leader's principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a Glepel-like choir.
That's when the idea came of making this exercise out of a loud solo performance of our own home music scene.
This was the case with Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], German Juci, then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song exactly what you planned or did the girls do on it?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an electronic version, and then, when the paper came together, we thought that this number needed something else.
He was drawn by the chord that I would make a voice out of him.
The other night, I sang the tune that the girl later learned.
It all came first and scaryly spontaneously.
I remember you were very impressed at the time, but of course you had to have the Dávias.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both the disc and the concert seemed to have the girls in background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short part), they have no role to play, they sing together and they are not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their songs.
They were standing in the back of the stage, too.
Is it deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was simply because of technical problems.
But it's conscious that we didn't want to play instruments.
The number also tells us to forget a little bit about our ego, where it came from, where it's going, just let those wings, the wings of love move us.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the story was born.
hvg.hu: Which one of the most important jobs did you have?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creative processes, rather than mixing, were more difficult pieces than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play a competitive piano game, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work the groove, and then pretty much everything was in place, like in a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which one of your favorite numbers is your new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the presentation and the fact that I've already let the disk go.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The betraying broker's minor feeling has cost billions of dollars because of the fact that he's a traitor.
Unbelievably gross.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Societé Générale's banker, called its former employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, almost five billion euro were lost.
However, it seems that Kerviel was more than just a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Contrary to the other banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He said to the chiefs of the police that called the police "that he had a low intellectual power,"
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel's statement indicates that at the end of last year, he earned EUR 1.6 billion in profits from his businesses.
The weather is not only in America but also in America.
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," she says.
In the summer, he was looking for half a billion euro in the United States crisis that was just in the summer.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that problems would be with subprime mortgages for customers with low income or past payout problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"While I was looking for the first half a billion, I didn't know how to report it," admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't keep anything to himself.
In his statement, he acknowledged that he had distorted his reports so that it would not come to light.
He was able to trick his bosses, even when Eurex's stock exchange started to be interested in his transactions.
The loss was loss-making.
Are you afraid that everything will come out?
I don't.
"I thought that only the fact that I made 1.6 billion dollars for the bank would reassure them."
Where did you get so much risk?
He achieved his position gradually.
After completing the Lyon University, he worked with the Socié Générale bank from 2000 onwards.
Her annual salary was around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was already a broker and became an independent broker in 2005, with a salary of $90 000 a year.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never make as many as others.
"In 2005, in my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with the wrong eyes.
My seniority, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives about Kerviel.
The first great success came shortly after the arrival.
He sought out allianz's shares because during the bombings in London he made half a billion euros for the fall of these shares.
And it started a lavelin - it wanted more.
As long as you leave us alone, we will leave you alone.
"It's like snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses claimed to have known everything, or rather suspected, about everything.
"As long as I made money, they lost sight of me."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
One billion euros was lost in a single day.
In the summer of January of a week, he wanted to cover me up.
When he started work Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that he lost five billion euros for it.
How did they find out?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
"I only took four days last year.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to see in their reports," Kerviel finished.
A total of 365 billion in the future was likely to be won by the next 365 billion billion.
The Czech Government ministers signed a total of nine operations programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic may obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is about half the total amount that can be seen from this period from March 2007 to 2013.
The region has seven operational programmes that cost approximately 125 billion years.
Czech companies will be able to raise around the age of 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion krona, targets transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the public foundation of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be funded next year by the age of 90,8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme will help entrepreneurship and companies to acquire assets intended for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research and the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In obtaining EU funds so far, the Czech Republic is among the least successful in the new countries.
The prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua was approved by the Court of Justice for 20 years in prison.
The President of the country, former president of the country, who was sentenced in 2003 to $100 million (up to a maximum of 1.8 billion kroons), was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Court of Appeal.
Later on, he was released from prison and in house arrest in a hacid in close proximity to the capital.
Whether or not the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 is going back behind bars again is not yet clear, according to AP News.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the leadership of the prisoner whether or not he will be allowed to execute the sentence of Alemaa at home or return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemaa that government funds were regularly transferred to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These political companies and their account numbers were actually related and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were subsequently carried out at the Foundation, which was set up to finance the campaign for the election campaign of Alemaa in 2001.
Our budget has been approved.
That's right.
The public budget has been adopted.
What's with the budget?
This is the first budget, adopted by a coalition majority, drawn up by this government without any support.
This year, last year, he went through with the support of the Socialist Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Committee of the Party of the Party of the Party of the Party of Social Democrats were not allowed to accept sex.
Unlike the debate on the government's lack of confidence before the vote, this time there was no drama.
The House has generally ignored this law, although it is the most effective law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance starts and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether or not it does.
The budget is an essential element of policy, but it is hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why you receive much more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are far more important to the public than mere numbers.
The public budgets of the former Social Democratic Governments have faced three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve simultaneously:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called 'truster' expenditure, which means not only pensions but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent 'coordination' of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is the first failure as a consequence of the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public funds, i.e. the deficits of budgets for cities and routes.
However, the greatest risk is not a public budget deficit.
it is publicly and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and routes.
In addition to the money from taxes, taxes and bank loans, ten thousand people are able to raise money for investments other than tax, tax and bank loans, often issued bonds with which their cities are disproportionately indebtednessd.
In recent years, it has been possible to recover these debts by means of a massive sale of the shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State from the privatisations.
They don't have such a source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase, like the rest of the world for a few years now, with which the North Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in place.
Instead, the country was increasingly driven into debt.
The rest of the countries managed with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Ukraine, Pakistan or Egypt, far more rationally than the PRC.
This is, first and foremost, the great shame of the former governments.
We belong to countries which, at global level, are the least threatened by poverty.
For this reason, there is no need for major social programmes, which have, in recent years, been completely indignantly swollen into gigantic size.
Although it has been possible this year to eliminate part of the unjustified populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if in the near future there will be no withdrawal of the limit on retirement and the pension reform, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs, it will be just an official act.
It is a little excessive that the governor's policies make most of the taxed money generally pension and social benefits mechanical distributions.
This is why the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the reduction of normal expenditure by the trustee's expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not exhausted everything they could have done in the last few years.
If we do not really want to be mere officials from the governor's politicians, then we need to be patient and need to need to be calm to prepare further reform laws for this not too strong, a well-known coalition government, that the State can only give what it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only these will allow the balanced budget to be gradually achieved.

The banks are trying to solve the crisis.
The central banks of the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
Money markets are thus costing more than one billion dollars through stock exchanges.
Exchanges on the bank increase the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed makes $40 billion available to the stock exchange and another $20 quarter available to the European and Swiss central bank.
For the first time after the 11th September attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the major economic problem, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote in his report to his clients from Bernard Baumohl, the Economic Group consultant company.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent," said Baumohl in his report.
Banks in the United States have already lost, in the first place, $60 billion on unreimbursed loans.
Estimates still count for billions of losses.
"Central banks may indeed be afraid of what might happen if they have chosen such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, Chief of Staff of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really wrong," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if their own banks are too difficult to access loans, they will also be more expensive to lend to their customers.
This would reduce the need and reduce the US economy to a recession with the potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided after having failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the retail interest rate in London, which is used for the purpose of selling money from the interbank market, to the extent that it was not possible to obtain the so-called LIBOR.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of cross-border cash transactions, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain have also recently reduced their interest rates during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to the additional drop in interest," he told the Reuters News Agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the action of central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, since it does not solve the fundamental problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The unbelievably unbelievably controversial arguments of the eco-logos.
Global climate change threatens most developing countries.
The President of Václav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book of the Blue Book presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made it clear that ecologists are inconclusive.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which forms a special mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
"The debate that we are discussing is absolutely essential to the structure, it's only a word-towing, which is a way to solve the current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting the book of the Czech President, he stressed the importance of his subject matter, which is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in German translation, since, as he said, "I often only meet with the cartoons of my opinion."
So now the natives can view his opinion as not distorted.
Klaus pointed out that although he was not a climatologist, he felt that he had sufficient basis for writing such a book on condition that he had sufficient basis.
Since he was able to monitor and evaluate professional studies as an academic expert in statistics and as an economist, he was also experienced as an academic.
The conclusion of the book meant that the climate is constantly changing, or its changes are normal, and not all scientists agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so they are not a threat, and the efforts to influence climate development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose non-proven opinions on others, which he sees as a dangerous restriction of liberty.
He again explained to these questions that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against the militant enviromentism, which does not take into account the link between costs and their benefits".
Klaus already spoke about this topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
They were unable to replace their licence period for 600 000 years.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not change their old licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can still apply for the exchange so that the agencies can issue a new licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's New Year's Eve hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without a valid travel authorisation.
According to the authorities, the licence was mainly not used by those who did not want to drive anymore.
While the epidemic is a serious fall in the interest in driving licences, the capital offices have been flooded with licence exchange applications for which interest has increased this week.
The Office of the Chief of Staff receives approximately $2,000 a day.
It's gotta be about half an hour in line.
In Prague, the driver's license was not replaced by some 10,000 drivers yet.
The issue of a new licence lasts for 20 days.
However, the new licence may be issued by a period of five days.
If so, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 crowns.
Drivers who cannot make a binding licence exchange by the end of the year and who are on their way with an invalid licence will be threatened with a penalty from January.
The culprit must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also settle the breach by means of an agreement.
In the event of an administrative breach, the penalty shall be 2500 kroons.
On the basis of the information received from the city hall, you may also be fined if you do not travel anywhere.
It is claimed that it could pay up to 30000 years of age.
The Ministry previously called on the officials to be forgiving and to impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Transport, tens of thousands of fines threaten no one.
According to him, a licence is a document where people can or cannot decide.
This is not a personal ID, which everyone should be valid for.
Those who don't want to drive anymore, they should give up on the driver's license.
It is time to take them or to send them to the appropriate office by post.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid at the end of the year.
However, passengers should gradually replace other types of licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 may continue to be replaced for three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional instruments.
The court was ordered by the court to impose fines on the detectives who joined Berdycchel.
Mr Opa and Mr. Petr Koñaík were former police officers who were found to be united with David Berdych's crime council and were sentenced to 13 and 10 years of imprisonment.
This was the final effect of the Supreme Court in Prague, which thus reduced the fines for one of them two years.
P.O.D. in Prague was originally sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, the review can only be brought before the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, it is only pending the first judgment.
In other proceedings, a total of more than 16 years has already been punished.
You can't have any more.
In January, the Court of Justice found it to be mainly 19 guilty of participation in kidnapping attacks, of which 16 appeals were brought today by the Supreme Court.
The majority of the defendants have refused the prosecution from the start of the investigation that it was a speculation matter.
According to the Central-Czech Senate, police members in addition to providing information from police sources, covering each of the kidnapping attacks and helping to avoid the threat of criminal liability to the gang after an agreement with Berdycc.
That's why the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koçaík.
The indictment concerns crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, it is a robbery that has often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of the civil servant and non-authorised detention.
Since the police have found guns, steel shells, lasers or machine guns that have been illegally held during the police house investigations, he has found a police investigation.
The gang indictment is that he's been tracking tens of millions of crowns from the robbery.
In this process, the courts have already recognised nearly 20 members as legally guilty of other kidnappings of Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
By the time of the first hearing, Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are under prior arrest in Ireland, were prevented from taking final decisions on the criminal proceedings against the Republic of the United States regarding their expenditure.
Account for child exchange: 12 million million dollars.
For children who have been replaced by parents, Igor Veleba, the legal heir to the damaged families, requires a price of 12 million kroons for the pain in the hospital at T'Abíč, plus a court fee.
Three million each, two million each, and one million for the children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The firm's legal representative Ondriej Dostál Veleba essentially disagrees with the proposal of Ondriej Dostál Veleba.
"This is the kind of day we refuse, because it's too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"In order to produce an opinion on the opposition, we need an expert opinion from the opponent.
We will determine whether there is a usable value at all.
But let us maintain our view that this will be measurable for hundreds of thousands of people," Dostal stressed.
According to the figure, the four parents should move between 10 000 and 20 000 Kč.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloñov family wanted a million crowns for every month unless it raised its own biological daughter.
Her brother was given an expert review on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was prepared by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to a psychologist and psychiatrist expert, suffered a different degree and depth of mental injury and stress.
The emergency situation has been better endured by men, even if they have met with a lot of people that have not prevented the renegade exchange.
Women worst deal with the current state of the trauma and what is happening right now, combined with the content of Veleba.
Verika and Nikolat were traded on 9 December by the nursery of T'Abíč on 9 December.
Last week, children have returned to their native parents - Nikolai Čermák to Píbyslavé, Veronica Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jablo -ov.
At the end of October, Vysočina's guide Miloš Vystrčil handed the families 10 000 crowns in exchange for their release due to the mistake of the hospital in tzebíčské, which is managed by the district.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must be included in the reserve, otherwise the founder may be asked for assistance.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts were calculated on the basis of a few thousand, otherwise a few million crowned tables.
Polivika lost the kingdom of Vikassko.
Bolek Polivika has lost the case for the address of the Kingdom of Vikassko.
According to the judge of the Ostara court, although he used the King of Valachi for the first time, the project was developed by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the theatre, with many years of work.
The police did not take part in the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is not likely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are living in the popularity of Bolek Polivika," said Polivika's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that the Valachi Kingdom is a word for everyone to remember the acting-commic.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have 10 years of work to do behind us.
The discovery of money and the discovery of actions, he said, "
He thinks the cause of the problem is money.
"A few years later, I realized that the project was successful and could win something out of it.
They want to get away from our work," he added.
The future business is a future business.
According to the court, the name of the king of Vala was first used by Polivka in a television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radosla Brzobobhatás.
However, this has not been linked to the purpose of the establishment of the fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports for something else.
The original muse-action became a business and profitable entrepreneurship, after which Harabiš founded the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Vikasko.
In 1997, Polivika agreed to state his name and signature in the passports and even their owners offered discounts on his farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
She also mentioned today that Harabiš himself used the idea only for the purpose of policy for the public undertaking in the manifesto.
"Boleslav Polivika's popularity for the Valachi Kingdom project must have helped," said the judge.
However, he added that the soul of the project was the Harabiš and his team, which was active in the process.
The cooperation of today's competing parties continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš Politika was officially co-ordinatored in Vsteina.
Since then, however, there have been conflicts between Politika and Harabiš, which have been hurled into the release of the eternal chosen King Boleslav.
On the initiative of Harabiš, the leader in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila Šuláko as a mother queen.
In 2002, after that, Polivika Harabiš and his agents brought an action for legal action against him, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabiš could bring light to the debate for the throne and for the queen's half.
This fight should make it a new king.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the date.
"We don't want to be assaulted by anything.
This should be something like the Slovackko finale.
The king should be elected for a limited period of time.
The politician may speak freely," Harabiš added.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: excellent prejudices.
To be honest, I never liked Peuge 206.
Loss of properties is nothing special, we can often estimate the quality of change, management and production below average.
But the successor to the market is already present, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the brand called SW goes a step further, so I have nothing left but to think more about.
When I tested Peugeot 207 classic boxback, for example, I complained in the back seat about leaving the head in the seat.
This time, the complaint is over here, because the combination's bodywork means that the two-meter-high giants are no longer suffering in this respect.
He's fast in the world. He's fast.
I get through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
This is a relatively good design, where my only regret about the poor console is that it's the only thing I've ever had.
I'd appreciate a little more designer activities here, if the car's look on the outside.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short side or arms of the seat?
Lateral driving also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
In the field, there is also a noticeable increase in body size.
In the other hand, after that, the head disappears from a few places that have already been mentioned.
Buttcases in the trunk of the trunk.
This is the main vehicle of the package.
This should be assessed as very accessible (including thanks to the outputable rear window) and with a wide range of spaces.
The empty spaces are equipped with handbrakes, which are ideal compromises.
It is not in the way, it is stretchable and it is also more difficult to deal with.
But let's stay at the volume for a while.
On the basis of these tables, the basis of the basic arrangement is 428 l, which is the average of competition compared to competition.
However, in the second place, it is not the most wanted-to-be-type vehicle against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation product in Moldá Boleslav, we find that Peuget is well behind the noticeably many 52 litres.
This value is already almost critical in case of a foreign holiday or of the introduction of a trailer.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the second line after taking off the back of my back or the very low threshold.
120 ling force in four rows.
The car we were carrying was equipped with a four-cylinder, ignition engine with a capacity of 1.6 l and an AU engine power.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look for the millennia that drives family pitchback.
It's quiet, small-daughter, and it's hot.
If we compare it to Škoda's equivalent, which often seems like a rag in its exhaust, so I can only be happy.
Word of the price
Car prices are not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a wide interior and a very good engine.
The car is still going for 329 900 Kč with a four-wheeled foreign engine.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The modified Premium equipment throws the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Only we still have head airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic air-driving start, rear windows with electric remote control...
then the car costs 531 900 Kč by tock-tock.
This is a lot, but count Fabia's accessories and get a very similar result.
Oh, I see there's nothing left but a decision on the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into the English school is not necessary.
In the UK, there are more and more children in Eastern Europe who create concerns about the further development of local school.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently faced with a number of obstacles.
The British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and residents of the country became violent.
The problems of the integration of eastern European children are well illustrated by a situation in the north-east of the country where there is an increase in the number of debates between local and Slovak immigrants.
The fights between learners, the bondings are already characteristic of the relationship between parents.
The situation has so far been that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who used iron to call a ten-year-old student.
The culprit defends against the boy’s insulting him with a racist cloud.
The police had to act after two Slovak immigrants were attacked by twelve-year-old girls.
The women claim that the man was cast with racist remarks and played with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop doing this with apples and pears, and then he revealed his naked butt," wrote down the mother of Slovak students, the second unforgivable incident for The Times.
There are complaints on both sides.
One of the local residents considered the disputes about immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in the UK school is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 job-seekers are considered Slovakian nationals.
Approximately 30 thousand Slovak students go to school in Slovakia.
Cuba is the island of the Caribbean region of Cuba.
It is indeed the island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this may happen if you choose correctly.
The sands and white coasts, high waves, or sea, are calm as a fish.
Tree trees and all inclusive with pools offering beach pizza, ice cream or mint cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and more extensive list.
On an island, however, you can find a lot more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Ancients.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was the strength of their U.S. conquests in Cuba.
Columbus called the most beautiful place that human eyes have ever seen.
Havana has become a warehouse and a transpocalypse that the Spaniards have robbed and transported to Europe in America.
Next came the American era.
The Nac International Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the U.S. Mafia, was built because everything that is a crime in the United States (mainly alcohol alcohol), was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among their guests, among other things, were their guests.
Winston Churchill, Open Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, plants were built, and on the wide highways, cars became a cult symbol of the 50th century of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio walls are printed with the signatures of the stars and politicians of the American show business.
Today?
You can also use the wall of Bodeguita in Havana.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you will be allowed to have a cocktail at your request.
And in the 50s, they're a cult car that travels to date in Havana, because the once-exported gypsies and your sons were already running away in this salt and sand air.
Although the oldest part of Havana in particular is seriously disappointed, there are no beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area than just there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much money, its development has been reduced.
Not only have new hotels been built in Havana for the past fifteen years, but also in Varader, on the part of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world offers another unique taste, which is appreciated primarily by train drivers.
Out of their extended plantings, sugar cane was delivered to the sugar plants by steam and motorcycles.
It will not be renewed for many years, so the machines that operate there can be seen, and the former ones can only be seen in museums.
Where are we going to go?
Most of Cuba's visitors will not miss the most known places.
So either Varader or Havana doesn't need to be written too much.
Let's just remind you that there is a museum at the Hemingways mentioned above, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss his visit to this museum.
Vídales-völd Cuba is one of the most picturesque parts of the island in the west of the island.
The hija vegetation is growing out of the harvest.
Casings, earth-caves and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their urchins, which has produced fertile soils, which also covers the broken edges with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
The final form can be found at a visit to one of the Havana cigar plants in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that there was a shooting of Major Zeman's Chilean episode.
(1S,2S,2S)
Ancient city, which was founded shortly after the colonization of the Spanish people.
Famous reputation and glory have been added to the trade in slaves and tobacco.
The economy is filled in the beauty and monumentality of the non-great city.
In four centuries, the colonial architecture, which had a significant impact on later French parents, has changed almost nothing.
It is a very secluded place between the plains of Escambray and the sea, Trinidad, that even in the 50s of the last century, there were no roads that would have linked this region to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, which is why they didn't break down, everyone was glad that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, you will be worth seeing the most interesting places around you than the coast of Playa Ancón or the Valley of Sugar mills.
In the evening, it is common to go to Casa de la Música, which you find after dark, where the music only settles by morning.
Baraco
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are considered to be the most beautiful city in the city.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo must fight high and isolated mountains, passing through a nature that is not much affected by human activity.
Due to the unspoiled nature of Cuba's eastern Earth language there, UNESCO has entered the World Heritage List on UNESCO.
Here is the best chocolate in the church, with Columbus crosses in the church (in reality, after a hundred years of shipping from Columbus) and the hill where the former castle stood and the El Castillo Hotel is now located, some of which are the most known El Yonque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Mestro plains, the Bay of Disznó and the island of Isla de Piros, the Kabar of Tupicana, the Duchess of Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, Africa, which is reported by the descendants of former slaves, all can be written about.
The way they say it right is a better way to see it.
The Afghan allies are passive, they are American.
There are also few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment to influence the course of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
According to Minister Robert Gates, NATO should set out concrete plans for the following years.
The Afghanistan mission is not carried out in the senses, the leaders of countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the south of the country have been agreed.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries will also discuss further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Minister of Defence Robert Gates has called for greater involvement this week in NATO troops, the United Kingdom considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government and the strengthening of development aid to be a priority.
"Afghanistan's development is an inclusive one, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The other public would be able to start further economic and security development on their own," said British Minister of Defence Des Browne to the BBC.

According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan uprisings has been the strongest in the past five years.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, and the number of acts of violence has increased by 60 per cent in the southern Helmand region.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their limits in the organisation and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts have been requested to teach Afghan troops.
"We really need to think about the specific goals for the future and the methods to achieve them," Gates said.
Mr Jaap de Hoop, Secretary-General of NATO, spoke in a similar spirit today.
"I am not happy about what is happening in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
Beyond all, we have fifty percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that is not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters News Agency at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government.
Out of the passive
There have also been discussions between the participating countries over the last few months about whether all all the Allies provide the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for its passiveness.
"The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were used in areas where violence and combat requirements are the least so they are not as high against them as they are against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
This week, the British flute called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghani Suns: The Germans will play while our boys are fighting," wrote Sun in the photo of the German soldiers playing tennis in table tennis.
The German Bild was in a counterattack and published a photo of a British team of regby-bics in the south of Afghanistan.
The general government debt will reach 1 billion in 2009
All Czech Republic's 84,000-year-old government debt is coming to the end of the year.
The total debt reached the age of 842.7 billion by the end of September.
This year, the government is planning to raise a loan of 15.9 billion kroons.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced this plan by 157.8 billion years due to the better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the central government of the Republic reached the age of 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year, this increased by 40.2 billion years.
However, from June to June, it decreased by 13.4 billion years.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today verified the state debt data from the beginning of October.
All Czechs have more holdings than the age of 84,000.
Last year, the state owed over 11 billion years all year round.
"It still seems that next year's lower deficit would allow us to go beyond the limit of one billion krona in 2009 only.
The next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, you can see this analysis of ING Finance, Vladimír Pikor: "We can go through the transition of a billion in 2009.
Exactly when, for the time being, it will depend on an unknown next budget.
If it were to prove that the situation was changing in the policy area, politicians would be willing to spend more money, this could change until 2010.
But I do not assume that change," he said.
Growth in GDP growth
General government debt is made up of central government debt, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of government deficits.
General government debt is financed by units of credit, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic indebtedness has increased by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion years.
Government debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion years.
By the end of September, the so-called productive public debt reached the age of 803.3 billion and decreased from June to 13.7 billion.
The average deficit of the government debt has fallen to 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is very much above economic progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds where the increase is 20 percent.
Bad thing is that debt is growing, but on the other hand this shows that there will be a reason to trade when the pension reform comes," commented Pikor of the data.
You can do better than just waiting for them to wait.
The financing strategy and the 2007 public debt management show that the government planned to raise a loan of HUF 159,2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 15.8 billion years due to the better development of the public budget.
The amount is mainly made up of a public budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroons this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion kroons.
It is also about the planned maximum amount of 13,3 billion kroons, the ten billion reserves for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion kroons of public bonds and the repayment of 1.8 billion kroons of loans from the European Investment Bank.
Today the teacher will appear before a court in Burma for a name given to a teddy bear.
On the evening of the last night of the court in Kaurúm, 15 days in prison and out of the country, he sentenced the British teacher in Sudan for the violation of Islam - his lawyer informed him.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six to seven-year-old students to name a plus bear as Mohammed. However, Islamic religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act may be punishable by sloping.
A 54-year-old British woman who was arrested in her own home on Sunday by the teacher of the Karúmi - who, according to paragraph 125 of the Sudan criminal code, was accused of violations and attacks of Islam after several times the student's students complained against her at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students 6 to 7 years of age to choose the name of the class's stuffed bear.
"The children have proposed eight names, including Hashan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says Robert Boulus, school director.
In the final vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed's first name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the prophet of Islam, but also very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then took a joint diary of the bear's photo and "My name is Mohamed" with the label "My name is Mohamed".
The problem lies more in the fact that any representation of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, one of the Muslim colleagues in the same school, said that he knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything to offend any religious belief.
Many of the teacher's students agree with this belief, and they believe that the teacher is "very well treated with children" and "Never talk about religion in the family".
Remember, Mohammed is also the second most popular first name in Great Britain, and there are 14 different scriptures in English.
This is often the first name chosen by Muslim families as one way of expressing respect for the prophet. (This name is given to the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game, for example?
This is a question of obvious interpretation.
There was no agreement at the last Vienna trial on Wednesday on the future status of the region.
End result: success.
The meeting between the Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo on Wednesday morning, Wednesday morning, on the status of the Sepatist province in Baden, Austria, was concluded between the Serbs and Kosovo.
"It is a pity that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status," he stated at a press conference in Vienna, in addition to the EU-Isinger.
The American Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was a "rolling risk" and encouraged Belgrade and Prista to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"In the near future, there will be no need for violence, but it will be a very difficult time", pointing out "the existence of manifest tensions."
The mediation will end on 10 December.
On Monday, most of the events involving the European Union, the United States of America and Russia are held in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90 per cent of Albanians' population may be clarified after Issinger, Wisner and the Russian broker, Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko, submit its report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
A meeting in Baden, near Vienna, reported on the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since last UN trust in the Troika in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their delegation mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiating solution, alongside the compromise," said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After 8 years of UN leadership in Kosovo, the Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Ms. Pristina told me that she was ready for a unilateral declaration of independence, if the Security Council does not decide for her benefit.
On the inside, it would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have failed to reach an agreement" - announced by the President of Kosovo's independent state, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where "the final trial of the last chance" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Commander of the Kosovo Resurrection and future Prime Minister of the Province, also expressed their regret.
He added, however, that Belrád's idea of autonomy would be "the continuation of the past that is invading murders and deportations."
"Domino effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that the compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral exclamation of independence.
In fact, he's afraid of the "dominos effect" because of the war of independence in the '70s, still in an unstable region.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise" - said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again stated that the decision would be solely to the Security Council, where the Russian Federation has a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable" - stated Vojislav Kostunica, Serbian Prime Minister.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end at the same time as they started at the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that 'the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word.' He added that, on behalf of the Albanians, a one-sided cry of independence will be made on the basis of 'agreement' with the Western powers.
Bush an agreement between Israel and Palestine between Israel and Palestine is an urgent agreement between Israel and Palestine.
On Tuesday, President Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmer and the Palestinian President, Mahmud Abbász agreed to enter into an immediate meeting in order to finalise the 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every possible way so that they could sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must stop "terrorist networks" and Israel must cease its colonial activity - declared Bush and reminded the two parties of its obligations regarding the 2003 Peace Agenda.
The President of the House stressed that the aim of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel led by the Abbator was "the signing of an agreement which would resolve all the issues that depend on it, including central issues".
The latter concern the three delicate issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who had left their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today’s State of Israel.
Abbász, who spoke after the US president, maintained that future negotiations would be "global and in-depth" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmer promised that the future negotiations would be "intermediate and continuous" and he would seek to "end even in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the implementation of the parallel Palestinian and Israeli 'two-state vision'.
Saudi Arabia stated that Bush had been given permission to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (recorded as a success for its participation in the Antapolis), with the support of all Arab countries, has set up a plan that guarantees peace for China if it withdraws in exchange for all Arab territories, including East Jerusalem, which were engaged in the war in 1967.
Annapolis "responsible in the history of the Middle East, in particular because he grasps the problem with his roots and focuses on the central issues", says the Duke of Saudi Arabia in his interview with the Saudi-related Arab daily.
According to the D.A., the police are not liable for any liability.
What happened on Sunday exactly?
As is usually the case with this kind of news, the official statement and the rumors contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN) on Sunday, just a few minutes after 17 hours, a police car went on the Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"The car patrol, so he didn't take action. He was at a speed of 40-50 km/h, without sirens", we found out from the police force.
The two unmanned young "high speeds" were driven by a green, "not registered in the official register, therefore not to be used in road traffic" (see below) with a branded engine of Kawasaki.
"Because they didn't comply with the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a cop.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows the strength of the impact, that the car's front was swept in, the windshield was shattered in shape, and the bumper came off.
In an extraordinary announcement yesterday by the Public Prosecutor of Pontoise, Marie-Térèse de Givry, he announced that IGPN and the Public Security Directorate of Val-D'Oise County were entrusted with the investigation "started for the loss of manslaughter and inaction".
During the afternoon at a press conference, the D.A. told me that the responsibility of the police at this stage of the IGPN investigation is impossible.
According to the D.A.'s report, three witnesses of the accident interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "a police report from the police station saying that the pickup was relatively fast from the left side of the police car."
On the day of yesterday, from a line that was undoubtedly pulled by the handles on the road, it was shown that the two roads had collapsed and passed together for a while until the police car had been able to stop it.
The vehicle has been booked for technical examination.
The two victims were subjected to a medical investigation last night on the body of the victim.
What happened directly after that?
Yesterday, the rumors in Villiers-le-Bel spread as a fire, saying that the police had to leave the scene quickly without helping the two young people.
In this respect, IGPN is carefully worded, but there is no way that the police would have made "any serious mistake".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more in-depth investigation and greater caution in doing so," we learned from the police source.
The Rental met with an eyewitness who reported on a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the spot.
"My brother, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went down to try and relive them", says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely confused and sneezed".
The other two tried to revive one of the young, and the other called.
The tension among those present has increased, as the hopelessness of the two youngsters has become apparent, so the arrival police have transported their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the announcement of the witness that the ambulance "after the police have left" arrived about 20 minutes after the police have left.
They used a CAM, but they didn't.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people were helped.
The firemen arrived immediately at the scene.
They did their best to save them," emphasised the D.A.
The tension in Pakistan is growing.
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations of the state of emergency launched two days earlier by General Musarraf on Monday.
According to witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country, in the town of Lahore, were injured by the gas bombs used by the police forces, who were responsible for the emergency measures.
In response, the police were betrothed with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
There were similar events in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several individuals have been created.
In Ilamabád, the registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and declared protests for arresting some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers this weekend.
Monday morning, in order to prevent the meeting, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed.
There were several protests in Muttan and Peshawar in the Northwest.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has also been supported by the great Adihida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which has ensnared the movement of religious parties. Director "He encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the need, and trash for those who took oaths before Musarraf."
"The Musaraf Agreement is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure imposed on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court should declare the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf by an indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Ifikhar Mohammed Caudhry, was removed from office and replaced by a different one.
"What we are witnesses of is illegal, constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the President to The News.
President Pervez Musarraf promised that he would take the lead of the army in order to take the role of the civilian president, after he had been put into office, "has lost his status" - announced on Monday by the Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, Minister of Information.
Musarraf, until 15 November, the first presidential mandate had to be removed from the military uniform until the end of the war.
The Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also been disproved by the rumors that President Musarraf would have appointed a place of refuge as his deputy general.
More than one third of the pregnancyes are unintended.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequately or not planned pregnancy.
Today, more than a third (36% of) of pregnant women are still unintended - it appears from the study of the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act which liberalises contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inadequately or not planned pregnancy.
Ined estimates that various contraceptive methods, such as pills or beespiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made the "born birth regulation" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 took birth control tablets in 1970, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, out of 10 pregnant women, 8 are planned.
Each of the five months is planning to be accurate and, if possible, then for spring, since this is the most pleasant season for the child to be received by the child.
A spectacular fixture on the space station.
astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work in space for more than seven hours to implement the spectacular repair of the emergency, broken solar module essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space tour proved to be record in many respects: repairs lasted a long time, had very little time to design it and had to be done away from residential modules with "baked" tools by astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of passage to laboratory modules.
However, they need to be taken care of with regard to the supply of electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer one module, which was already on the ISS, to its final position with the help of solar panels of 17.5 kg.
Then the crew started opening 76 m wide solar panels in the module.
That's when one of the compatible tablets was damaged by a stuck cable in a length of approximately 1 m.
To avoid further injury, the opening of the table was not continued.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take a controlled walk from the Discovery space shuttle and then fix another, failed rotational solar module. Instead, their full time had to be devoted to repairing the damaged solar module.
The choice was for parazynski to perform the trick on the 30-metre crew of the space shuttle attached to the station’s hull.
He's one of the best "spacewalkers in Nessa. "
He has a high, strong, highly skilled, muscley upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old, medically trained man therefore had to "cooperate" the "damaged" solar module.
After carefully assessing the damage caused, he cut the wrong wire and recorded some "spins" in the damaged area.
In his work he also helped another "spacewalk" who stayed near the safe passageway and from inside the other astronauts, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
It used a tool, a mini hockey stick, which was supplied with insulation against hundreds of volts of solar panels, the station's astronauts shot it off and "switched it" it together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his others fully opened the table and only then he packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts held a half-day rest and today, this week, the Discovery space shuttle returned to start the return scheduled for Wednesday.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is falling.
The price of EADS shares fell greatly on the Paris stock exchange after the company that manufactures aircraft and security equipment announced that the delay in the development of A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1,2-1.4 billion.
The EADS share exchange rate is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its forecasts of operating performance in 2007, as the A400M engine is running late, which obviously means that the flight will continue to be delivered later.
The delay in the transfer of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, will cost "a sum of EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will be affected by Airbust" - announced by the European EADS company's parent company.
As a result of this expenditure, the EADS will have to provide new plans for its operating performance in 2007 next Thursday, when it reports its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any additional figures.
The group also claimed that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS's operating performance decreased by 86%: it was largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the A380 machine, which is also a huge financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Do you know how to view it?
Sunday elections will not be a big surprise: the great majority of the Russians will vote for Prime Minister Putin, the United Russia.
In this case, the need for stability and arbitrary governance of the Russians is apparent after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, through the public service channels, speaks in a message to the voters, which has already been set up, but the content is still secret.
Putin is the leader of the Kremlin support party, the candidate list of the United Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of the foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Prime Minister did not tell us anything: he just ran off again from the Western countries' interventions, which was his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know what the price is for true democracy, so we want fair, absolute, transparent and open elections, without any infringement," he added.
However, the opposition feels that this is not the case at all.
The opposition condemns the campaign, according to which they put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gengyij Zjuganov, claims that "this dirty election in Russia was not even in Jelcin's time.
After last weekend's protests were defeated, the former chess World Champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in jail for a non-authorised statement, and his lawyer claims that he is still not available.
"The Russians are still thinking like a 'homo soeticus'."
The likely results of the selection are two, even more obvious, questions:
- Who's following Putin in the General's chair?
In the official paper, yesterday the date of the first presidential term was announced, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates may indicate their intention to start their term of office until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putyint was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any longer.
However, there is no other successor on the sidelines.
- What role does Putin play since March?
Will you become Prime Minister?
Will he decide on the government and the President as the leader of the Universal United Russia Party or the parliamentary majority?
No matter what happens, both Parliament and the Presidential elections will be won by the exodus power.
This has now become a vessel.
"The Russians are still thinking of the 'homo agreedicus' method: they do not feel that they can control their fate" - says Le Gudkov, socialist, director of the independent Levada headquarters.
Nikolai Kosov, historian of the University of Szentpetervár, goes even further: in theory, the country has become a cross over five hundred years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is delayed, and the traditional community spirit has held back the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin reached the paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. For the most part, since this new type of patriarchism did not involve fear, but a certain economic well-being", said Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "responsibly reject personal responsibility", which was quickly revealed after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we believe?"
This phenomenon affects all aspects of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian region.
The freedom imported from the West often embodys chaos, as was the case in the 90s.
The public opinion is in favour of stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cheredychenko 54-year-old teacher follows: "Why should we think about this?
The authorities are not so bad, why should we replace them?"
Pulptor memory memory
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive, which records the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime, has become public.
The 47 million archive documents, which contain 27 kilometres of parks in Bad Arolsen, Hessen Province, have so far only been researchable for the purpose of "humanitarian", i.e. only a unique and name-named view of the victims or their descendants in the port.
In May 2006, eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, providing for the management of the archive agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After ratification of the Convention by all states, the archive was opened yesterday.
Detailed information
Opening the Bad Arolsen Library allows historians to carry out research into "the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the state of health of personnel" - explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive held by the Public Committee of the Red Cross.
So far, several countries, including Germany, have also opposed the disclosure of documents as they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have assumed homosexuality or mental disability.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons. The aim was to investigate the civilians who were deported or sentenced to work on this basis and to provide evidence of their intermission, possibly providing evidence of the compensation they received.
Bad Arolsen is currently dealing with the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs by more than 300 permanent workers.
However, part of the public does not consider the opening of the Bad Arelsen archive to be of particular importance.
"These documents basically do not contain any new information" - announced in 2006 by Professor Hungang Benz, Director of Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the University of Berlin.
The EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The annual turnover of bilateral trade in India is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU's first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced Peter Mandelson, European Commissioner for Trade and Kamal Nath, Indian Minister for Trade.
EU foreign ministers have already approved in April last year that the European Commission is launching negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Federation of South-East Asian Nations (USA). The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indonesia is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU's first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also an Indian foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can be economical for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a growth market with a population of 450 million."
Every year, the two great Europeans, Europe and Asia represent 'EUR 47 billion worth of products' and 'EUR 10 billion worth of services', said Danièle Smada, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, stated that the two major European importers, Europe and Asia each year, expressed their concern that bilateral trade "has not always achieved its full potential". The EU and India will meet in New Delhi in the framework of the eighth diplomatic summit, which will take place in Manmohan Singh and José Piraoo Barroso, President of the European Commission on Friday, New Delhi.

Answer the questions: The Bank of England will offer 10 billion pounds to the financial market for a five-week maturity of five weeks.
The Bank of England wishes to alleviate its concerns about the environment, so it announced on Thursday that it will pump GBP 10 billion into the money market, which will be available at a base rate of 5.7% and, unlike usual, a five-week maturity this time.
"We also want banks to be more secure to plan their liquidity position for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered by 6 December in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international financial market", says the bank's press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on December 6th, at 12:15 p.m. on local time.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue cash for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
The Bank of England stated in its press release that "the adoption of appropriate further measures" in order to ensure that the interbank loans are consistent with the key bank rates.
The current interest rate on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the 18 September level, currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the financial market crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has charged a significant interest rate on the amounts invested in the money market, which has alarmed the banks from taking them back.
The rumor (which only strengthens the exchange rate of the currency against the euro) would have made many more happy with the funds offered by the European Central Bank, which would have been more favourable and more discrete.
The UMP and the NC refuse to examine the Socialist proposal on public procurement.
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouvee Centre group closed their doors to discussing the articles of the Socialist bill on the subject of public procurement, which is equivalent to their rejection of the text itself.
At the meeting initiated by the Socialists, the text contained about five measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including 50% increase in employment allowances, the recovery of variable fuel taxes, the introduction of travel checks and the restriction on rents.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the discussion between the party and the opposition, which sometimes involved in lively speeches, ended at the end. This was only a few hours before President Nicolas Sárkozy's statement on the victory was made in relation to the election.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would resubmit all his proposals in the context of the amendment of the corrective financial act, which would be on the parliamentary agenda next week.
A new festival will be created.
There has been a recent rumors about the new festival of music in Philadelphia by C3 Press, but now the event has been announced by the organisation and advocacy company that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New York in cooperation with Melvin Benn, the British producer company of the Republic.
"It is an honour to work with a man who is the starter of today's American festival movement," said Billboard.com to Charlie Charlie from C3.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Chicago.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in the summer, so it will also be possible to plough.
The festival will be held between 8 and 10 August in a private area of 500 bodies, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The President of the Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Faddler, is one of the world's most respected festival directors.
In 1989, the British Reading Festival began to attract some 80 000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further increased her independence with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Republic was invited to the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival for producer, licence management and organisation tasks. By now, this festival is capable of receiving up to 177 500 people.
C3's staff, Charlie Jones, called the Glastonbury Festival "the most innovative event ever attended". He added that his company and company Melvin Benn are working together to make the region happy with a European business management.
"We've chosen the venue in Philadelphia before, and we worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie.
"We fought the city and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, because of the town's political maneuvers, the organization was lost in a disaster," Charlie continued.
"We were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing for a huge festival in another unique location, which will ultimately also serve the interests of the inhabitants of Philadelphia."
The C3 Press re-launched the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in Grant Park in Chicago, Chicago, after having already demonstrated its exceptional event in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross income of both events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both of these cities were located in a city location.
"The European concept ofMelvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our farms are usually in urban lowlands," says Charlie.
Our goal is to implement the two models in some way, thereby creating both the European rural mood and the traditional urban life in the Americas."
Vineland is about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vienna, and even the mayor himself, are very much in favour of this event," says Charlie.
Although he does not mention the details of the agreement, he states that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in such an event to be made at a location which, hopefully, will give the festival a long time to live."
Charlie Charlie states that the festival will be of an "artificial" size, with a capacity of approximately 80 000 people in the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennesse.
The joints have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland will essentially be a rock festival, but we are planning a diverse music offer that everyone will find something to please him", says Charlie.
You and your two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, form the C3 company, which received the "best independent event manager" award in the last Billboard Touring Award.
who is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to deal with the Terminator yourself...
The invitation is one of the tasks of the delegation from Montreal.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" because the governor of the Republic of China, Arnold Schwarsonger, is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight "Terminator Governor"?
"We must be careful because the technology itself decides which of its best places to be.
If you think that the conditions on today are favourable, you're going to go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they choose for us," says Schwarzenegger.
A translation of the plains for a comparison.
However, Denis Turcotte is now mostly focused on the promotion of Canadian films.
In fact, the competition for the Powers has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many films as possible at every American film festival, whether it be the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'ögge des ténèbres was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, it will also be drawn up at the Palm Springs International Festival.
The film "A Shake Hands with the Devil" is also presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also represented himself with four short films and four films this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will the end of the year be held on the stock exchange? The expert will share the opinion of the expert on the subprime crisis.
Five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to the end of the usual year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the expert whether this really will happen.
Banif says that "statistically in December, the stock exchange usually conducts positively.
However, forecasts of a statistical nature alone are not necessarily accurate, and even in the current situation, uncertainty is characteristic of the market, at least in the short term.
Experts are far from opposed to the end of the stock exchange year, although they argue that "the presence of liquidity in the stock market is maintained, this gives the opportunity to invest, as there are no alternatives to the guarantee, in particular fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the escape to quality securities, as long as in the long term.
Therefore, they suggest that the exchange will have a more lateral, non-voltile movement, especially since the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is currently unknown, the crude oil price will be high and the inflationary tension will be threatened.
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means that it would also be risky to claim that there will be a rally.
The expert said, "It's not always a concern to have a situation."
Ibex's loss was close to 4 percent compared to the highest value recorded on November 8 when it was closed at 15.94,7 points in the index.
However, not all experts are so dazzling.
Juan Solana, an analyst at InterMoney, says that Ibex 35 can close the year close to 16.000 for the reorganization of the wallets and then for contributions to the normal pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the week after the second week of December, the long weekend after the Constitutional Festival.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, says that we are close to the legal level and that "of course we can see a fall in the stock exchange rate, which may arise depending on the news from the US, on the consequences of the credit crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree with what will be the securities that will be assigned to Ibex's new maximum quotas for new quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "this is the turn of the great machines this year."
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, "because the electricity industry will be very expensive by then.
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco claims that this increase is due to the banking sector and the industry.
The rally can also be positive for the construction companies, if any.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months, and we hope that the construction companies Ferroval and FCC will follow this route," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main player in the remainder of the year due to the increase in sales during the period of Christmas sales.
On the other hand, according to the expert, the technology companies are also well-functioning, although the representation of the Spanish market in this area is not too high.
Five times in the last seven years, five times.
In the last few years, there has been only a December exchange rate fall twice in the last few years.
The actual end of the year was observed in 2003 when the stock markets broke out of the crisis caused by the outbreak of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28,17 per cent, a jump of 6,68 per cent was registered in December.
So it is still possible that 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profit year (at the same time, Ibex is showing an increase of 8,3 % since January) and that the final race will take place.
The Banco Popular Español opens a 12-hour-old account from 200 Monday to Saturday.
Banco Popular Español has decided to refurbish most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts located in the most relevant parts of Spain.
These figures run under the Popular Max name and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, for this is the first group whose branches are to be held continuously until 20:30 on a regular basis, even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20:30 a.m. on a regular basis.
The other group, the BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it is planning to renew its office, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
Recently, he is preparing a deal with trade unions, which closes 75% of his branches to open a afternoon in exchange for a week, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will decide whether to join the initiative to support a more favourable stay of business.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank wishes to operate 200 branches of the bank throughout the country for 18 months with the said register, because it is not a new system but an existing conversion.
This institution updates its branches in the trading zones, as the case may be, as the case may be, the customers of each street.
Thus, the extension of the period of leave is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the branches, a more modern and beautiful design.
Trade banks' responsibility, Ángel Rivera, points out that restructuring does not require major investment, but they must employ more employees, each accounting for eight or eight employees instead of the present six.
The branches in which even the negotiations for SMEs will take place will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable experiences
The Banco Popular Español has already carried out the initiative in three Madrid branches.
Ángel Rivero said that experience was favourable.
The choice fell into branches in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, Madrid, and according to Rivero, the decision proved to be correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.00 branches.
He also has 60 additional posts under the name Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, and also has a very favourable holiday arrangement, even on Sundays and holidays.
In those units of PopularMax, they do not use the BBVA model, where each branch offers a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our customers", says Rivero.
Currently, they have reached an agreement with Telefonica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antana 3's stock exchange value.
"We did it.
with this sentence, Paolo Vasile, Commissioner of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the time of the closure of the market when it turned out that the television driver he was running had doubled the value of Antena 3.
Yet, one of the joys of the shadows: "It only hurts that this is not because we have increased more, but because we have been less," he said.
He has already placed great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market "we were less than we were."
The TV was closed yesterday on 22.4 percent hardness.
This increase places its annual loss at 15.66 per cent.
52 percent of the company's Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento's, so the stock exchange value, according to Bloomberg, is EUR>>eng<<,88 million.
Rivalisa, Antena 3 lost 1.5.2% yesterday and has been able to book a 4 percent reduction since January, so yesterday, it was worth half as much as half a million.
The total value of the other telecommunications companies in Sogecable is 3.5 million; the value of Prisa (issuing the Cinco Dias) is 2.5.8.5 million and Vocento is 1.7 million respectively.
In the opinion of the Commission, the comparison with Antena 3 is likely to result in a similarity between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can deliver on the same market, what costs, and how we can pay for this in view.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first gross 1 billion commercial revenues more than the network, said Giuseppe Tringali, Commissioner of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a subsidiary of the Group's advertising companies.
If the facts are reported, compared to 965,4 million registered in the 2006 financial year, this year the media channel would increase its revenues from advertising by 3.6 percent.
Antena’s turnover of 3 net sales increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (so it reached 734.4 million), while the net sales turnover of Atena increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
Analysts believe that one of the factors that triggered Telecinco's momentum in the stock exchange is the high payout that has so far remained: in 2006 the CEO of Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the company's profits among its shareholders.
I think that, although it would be too possible to decide, this ratio may change after purchasing 33% of Endemol's 33% by the parent company Mesite.
"We guarantee a minimum payment of 50%, although we have always allocated a lot more than that.

Analysts believe that the market is currently facing some decline.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced its yields to Telecinco by 7% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
According to their estimates, this is due to an estimated increase in turnover from 1 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent in 2009, and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent in 2008.
The same company estimates that Antena’s profit for 3 is reduced by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009 by 4.5 per cent in 2008.

The Assembly approved the adoption of MiFID on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote of the Congress which approved the changes to the Senate, the government has launched a social dialogue on the rules on which the law is based so that it can enter into force both of them before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups have highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to establish the best standards for protecting investors and to regulate the activities of companies in a detailed manner, in order to ensure efficient market operation.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Act, allows financial markets to be modernised, at the same time strengthens investor protection, extends the supervisory rights of the National Securities Markets Committee (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new director will allow financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies to create a new financial service company (ESI), namely financial management companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions involving funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and inter-intellation systems for the execution of orders, which compete with current stock exchanges operators.
Furthermore, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide information on the specific aspects, risks and risk management methods of their business profile and to register all operations carried out by CNMV to be verified.
A number of amendments have been introduced by the Committee on the Economic and Social Committee of the European Economic Area, which are of particular importance that securitisations are treated as "complex" funds because of its high risk to the investor, which is confirmed by the US's high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the director was also used to legally define the scope of the activities of those with an economic and business skills.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new actors in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent working on another account, who does not need the authorisation of CNMV and can sell products or acquire customers to more investment firms at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1% in November.
This figure, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows developments in prices in Spain for the month of November.
It is made public in accordance with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their occurrence.
The calculation method used for the preliminary figure is the same as the one used for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modeling method is the same as the one used for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office stressed that the preliminary figure was purely indicative and could therefore be different from the final data which would be published on 14 December.
"The consumer price continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Government and Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November will only be "temporary", but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to show a "very high" value in the coming months.
In the House, Solbes confirmed that "although the figure is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained at more or less the same level in recent years within the monetary union.
He also added that the month of November brought "less surprise" than the month before, when the government did not expect such an increase.
We have expected a value of around 4 %," the Minister of the Economy acknowledged regarding the information published today.
Through Northern Rock, it will provide €42 billion in Virginia over three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only reached 12 billion pounds (16 billion EUR 800 million), since it has been in crisis in September and it has to raise urgent loans from the National Bank of England.
At that time, he had a record of more than GBP 25 billion in deposits, the number of which decreased gradually over the past two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence, despite the government's promise of a hundred percent guarantee to the bank at the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under the name of Virgin Money under its own financial and trade name. Virgin will have to obtain about a quarter of the income of British banks in the next three years to obtain the remaining £18 billion and thus reach the 30 billion target.
The Group of High-Responsibility Businessmen, Branson, has become known for its high-profile advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend some 50 million pounds (EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach the target.
Northern Rock has highlighted the offer of the Virginia consortium this week as the most favourable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged corruption.
The police arrested the village of Totana (Central Party) in Murcia today at dawn, as it is suspected that it was involved in the urban corruption scandal which occurred this week.
Outside, one of the mayors of the Town Hall and the mayor of the House was arrested.
In May, the former member of the municipal representative José Martínez Andreo took over the place of the MP Juan Morales, who, according to the authorities asked by the SER network, was the head of the corruption network.
The police will continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal which broke out this week.
According to information from the SER broadcaster, Juan Morales' lawyer in the People's Party was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption dossier in his bag.
According to police sources, the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a urban development agreement with a steel construction company on the transfer of 200 hectares of land to 200 hectares of land.
Two people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they receive the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to chair the PSO's agenda in the following parliamentary elections and to hold the parliamentary office if the Socialists are to win the election.
This was announced by the POE Secretary, Joséși, at a press conference, and you, Mr Bono, confirmed this at the party's federal centre after meeting with Zapatero this afternoon.
The Prime Minister justified the choice of the former Ministerial Minister's election that "we have to deal with the best" in politics, and Bono is among the best in politics.
He added that the Mancha politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the President of Parliament if the Socialists win the next elections.
Mr Bono would like to take over the place of President-in-Office of the European Parliament, Mr Marín, who announced on 15 November that he does not intend to take up the next elections and give up his political career, rather in scientific circles, then fighting climate change.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister was constantly intimidating to return to the scene of politics after two years ago he abandoned active politics.
He added that, since the voters are aware of who the economic leader will be in the case of the Socialists, the party would also have wanted to inform them of who will be President of Parliament in the light of "transparency".
If Bono really will fill in the post, you want Parliament to be "a place of respect and not an area of insult or screaming" and be more similar to the home of the citizens.
"At times, it seems that Parliament seems to be the only place in the country where it is not possible to sit, that the Prime Minister's speech has been broken up 26 times in the Senate.
He also welcomed the current President, Mr Marín, for his "excellent work", but he did not want to mention himself as a president, so that the opponents did not consider him to be a "supervisor".
A campaign for the climate.
Since the movement that announces climate change is ruthlessly pursuing both sceptically provocative towards their predictions, and those who prefer political or social battles should be very strong.
In fact, he must appoint a political leader like the Prime Minister Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the struggle against Islamic terrorism and states that "we must conclude a new agreement with our world".
However, this observation raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is concerned and why the Government has not sought to avoid this?
It should also be clear to Spaniards what measures they intend to take to contain climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what customs should the population change, what kind of energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will be for individual and social levels?
Who needs to make a sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't and we're not going to get an explanation for these questions.
Just because it's sacrifice and money.
Climate change measures, actual measures are always untraceable.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the general public.
Even the increase in PSO's fuel prices would have been such an unbelief before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That Earth must be saved by empty, simple propaganda texts, empty, without real consequences.
Agreements, committees, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with the Earth, as said by the Prime Minister, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, attack, or build election meetings and tenderness within us.

The mayor and chief of police of Totana have been arrested for alleged corruption.
The police arrested the city of Totana in Murca, the district of José Martínez Andreot, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a catering company for crimes related to urban development, informed the police sources today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and transferred to the City Hall, currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of Industry and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last Monday in a case where 2 hectares of agricultural land could be built into an area to allow the Nuaria company Galicia to build 4000 apartments, because they were illegally paid to managers under their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation as instructed by the Totana Court of First Instance.
The first three persons under arrest were referred to the Court of Justice for the first time.
As soon as possible, Totana's former Mayor Juan Morales, who today is also under investigation by the independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being examined, as is the current girlfriend of the previous mayor, who lives in the centre of Murcia Province.
The director and owner of the Nuari Company, the lawyer and the entrepreneur, were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., which is also part of the Nuari Company and through it the bribes were carried out.
The investigation will be carried out by a group of persons entrusted with crimes committed at the municipal level of the Central Unit of the Police, whose members held 11 houses outside the arrests, primarily in companies related to prisoners, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, a single person was arrested: a owner of a highly well-known poultry product company, who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuari Company would have created the largest residential property in Totana, to which 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company has reached 2.2 million square metres in Totana, which has been reclassified, and the project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group belongs to companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigo, which are responsible for managing the parking spaces of the Koruna, Venezuelan streets and the Catholic Fedinánd Square, Conycase, Hogartel specialising in direct marketing and Preconiza on the sale, promotion and assembly of buildings.

If my colleague is right, someone's really out of hand.
I don't know.
My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following title: "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it.
In other words, employees' feelings on payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonni, with a tomography of magnetic resonates, and the results were also published in the last number of Science.
The author of the study and Head of the Life&Brain Institute Neurochognognosy Group in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly and the participant was lost".
Researchers found that if they both responded correctly and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if either of them received twice the amount, the effect was also strengthened.
I don't know why so much science had to be so simple to concluding.
The Prime Minister of the Balkans is the Prime Minister of the Balkans.

Is she okay with me?
Car insurance, which represents a significant cost to the car’s car’s trade, depends on a number of factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a licence, family status, type and type of use of the car to be insured.
The acquisition of a car is only the first step in getting a car.
In fact, it is often more difficult to choose the right insurance than to decide which car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is liable for damages at the rate of the fixed premium in the event of an accident.
The insurance premium is in practice the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a licence, family status, type of car to be insured, use of it and more.
The insurance companies determine the premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. they pay a higher amount for those who represent a higher accident risk.
This is why women and women over 25 pay less, because statistics show that they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Therefore, it is estimated that insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than single people.
The type of car use is the key to the use of the car.
The possibility of an accident is increased by more than the most common use.
In determining the premium, many factors are taken into account by the companies.
Therefore, the owner should carefully examine the choice of the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
Here are the most important factors in the choice to be able to adapt and set an appropriate price for the insured person's needs.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, people under the age of 25 must have a number of disadvantages, such as lack of experience in driving and freshness of the licence.
Although the most conscious is that we are safe against all dangers, there are also more efficient solutions.
The more cautious leaders can commit complete insurance against all dangers, and the price will be affordable as well.
For such a contract, the insured person shall pay part of the loss.
"The amount of the contribution paid by the insured person depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the contribution," says Luis Noguera, the director of First Europe in Spain of online insurance.
Another option is the extension of liability to third parties where the customer provides himself or herself with insurance against damage to others, but not against damage to his or her own car.
In addition, there will be security against theft, fire and the loss of the car.
One good Council.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as this has an impact on the bonus and thus reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
A bonus compared to the company's basic tariff is called a bonus.
The penalty charged on the basis of the basic price is also called a plethora.
"The rate of bonus and commission depends on the company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, you can allow yourself to increase the bonus rate" explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year-old is over the age of 25, it is easier for owners to take adequate insurance as the risk of accidents decreases due to the experience gained over the years.
At that time, we advise you to take out complete insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experience properly in an accident or even in a driving process," claims the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that the majority of accidents take place in the second year of management, when the managers are already overrun by the fears of the beginners.
If the insured person is already married but has not yet had children, it is best to take out full insurance, of course, if his financial resources allow that.
Insurance companies consider the married couple to be the least risky for clients, and therefore, in their case, the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, the best full insurance is self-employed (that can reach 300 euros) or, if it has a higher bonus, the vehicle may remove the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to another.
"They drive more slowly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can allow themselves to have a higher self-sufficientness", confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, full insurance is offered with confidence (which is around EUR 150) or with a higher bonus, it is possible to include liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it provides protection to the owner in the event of an accident, but also because it means a major expenditure, so it is essential that we choose the appropriate form of personalised insurance.
Celt wants to score a point in Milan in order to get into the finals.
Milan and the Celtic will measure their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to find the missing point at the closure of the Champions' League. The Italians can be the first to qualify for this, and the Scots can qualify for this.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round, they've provided a way forward with a draw against Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but one more thing should be that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, does not advance it.
The two seasons of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13th the semifinal will try to fight the way forward to the 16th final.
This group D ends more quickly than the others, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the finale, the two teams will strive to win, as the Italians do not want to miss home, and the first thing Celtic can do is take a better turn in the eighth final.
Even defeat for Strachan's team is enough to qualify himself if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be certain of that, because if there is a point equality, the Ukrainians will go on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to disappoint the evening of the Scots, who wish to enter twice more into the Final Final of the League of Transformed Champions twice again, when they were just caught there in the last season with a goal from the Kaka in the addendum from the 0-0 to the mark (1-0).
The winner of "Rossonerik" would be most pleased with Shakhtar, because if he loses Celtic he'll be in the semifinal and he'll be in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, even though currently in its last place and unlikely to be in the European Championship, can still get his third seat with a win, which he could play in UEFA.
Two thousand people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Canada) started his tour, and they were performing for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Gingi Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were notified a few minutes before the concert organised in Vancouver GM Place that the joint "remems" was written together.
Some 2 million people replaced tickets to attend the concert, where they also presented a film about the great successes of the 1990s.
With the re-construction and the tour, a new album was also placed on the market in Spain by the EMI, which includes the larger labels and two new songs from Headlines and Voodoo.
Spice Girls' five members played in a bracelet from "Posh Spice"'s husband, the British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also on the scene of GM Place, which was full of view, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him from doing so.
When the performance was reenacted, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not yet seen our performance dress, so I'm nervous about what she's gonna think about the performance."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the joint broke up two years after he quit one in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other. He also seemed nervous at the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was also scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings about the Spice Girls changed.
Now I'm glad I've decided to," said Chisholm about the band that broke up with him nine years earlier.
The singer also added that, in the meantime, "the things have been arranged and we love each other very much.
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV reports, Virginia Airlines has arrived on a special flight to Vancouver.
They were waiting at the airport for a bunch of baby-sitters.
Five of them have seven children.

They will take action on 23 December of the year of the year.
Another fear of the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute is another one of the fears of the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute.
The gas supply between Ukraine and Russia was renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transited through Ukraine and there is always a great deal of attention to the disputes between the two nations.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the price of gas to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with a higher transit charge.
A previous debate between the two countries last year led to a reduction in supplies to EU countries.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscow was launched between the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, which relates to the Gazprom's attempt to reach an agreement on the price to be paid to Russia in 2008 by Ukraine.
Gazprom stated that for gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan, the price agreement with Ukraine in 2008 would require a 50% increase in the case of gas produced in the neighbouring country.
Analysts believe that this could mean a 40% increase in the price of cargo from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that during the course of the course of the day we should reason in accordance with one of the most important transit countries for gas," said Anatolij Kinah, Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs, to the Reuters News Agency.
"A change in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the scale of the costs of transit (and transit to Western Europe) from Ukraine."
As a result of the last significant gas price between Moscow and Kiev, in January 2006 Gazprom blocked the hit to Ukraine.
This resulted in a domino-reduction of exports to Western Europe, which at the same time largely repressed prices.
One quarter of the European Union's gas supply is accounted for by Russian gas.
Russia has world-wide natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply is supplemented by gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS "is obliged to check foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS Committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside the EU - declared by a supervisory body.
The proposal for a Chief Officer of Robert Black was submitted following an attack by a doctor of a foreign nationality in Scotland following an attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
He also expressed his concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
In its report - through the model of five health authorities - it pointed out also that key measures have been taken to ensure that they are properly implemented.
Following an attack on the Glasgow airport, the chief auditor has verified the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The doctor of 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep tried to drive to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom.
In the case of staff from overseas countries, the NHS Committees should verify the existence of the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned and their provision with the necessary permits to work in the United Kingdom before starting employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees are using Disclose Scotland to verify the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
The report of the Chief Officer suggested, inter alia, that committees should implement the Guidelines on Criminal Register, which will facilitate the monitoring process with different overseas countries for the employer.
"Although evidence of such checks has been found among the staff records, they are not regularly implemented", the report states.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment examination process at a high level, added: "Our report highlights the development of the system in order to provide up-to-date information on the staff of NHS overseas personnel.
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, says that "very unlikely" is to allow us to identify potential NHS employees who will be able to commit terrorist acts in the future by means of pre-employment controls.
"According to the report, the current employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent", he said.
According to the Scottish health authority, the current number of overseas staff in most of them is 1161.
However, the principal pointed out that the figures were likely to be higher, partly due to the fact that the identification of staff on leave for an indefinite period of time is a problem for committees.
The investigation has also shown that the verification procedures established in the Ayrshire and Ardan area, in the Olympics, in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, in Lanarkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and evidence of skills.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Directive and guidance on checks on the employment of workers from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon's Secretary for Health said: "I am very pleased to see that, after the attack on the Glasgow airport, this task has been carried out.
He added that, in cooperation with the health committees, the Scottish Government will take into account the proposals set out in the report and ensure that up-to-date guidance on pre-employment controls for all workers, including those from overseas, will reflect the best practical application. The updated version will be published next month.

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy.
Saudi Arabia published yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested who were planning an imminent attack on an oil plant and the execution of several attacks on church people and security forces.
According to the public report of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells was smuggling missiles.
Al-Qaida's support campaign against the Monarchy has been launched since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as the United States of America.
It is reported that eight cells, led by a resident of a foreign national, are being attacked against an oil plant in the eastern province.
After an attack on the world’s largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq, organised by Al-Qaida in 2006, Saudi Arabia started to build a rapid response force of 35 000 to protect the facilities.
According to the Minister of Home Affairs' report, 18 of the arresters belong to a body which is led by a "specialized in anti-trafficking" person who has crossed the border illegally".
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the territory of the kingdom.
On 22 of the arrests, 22 of them had plans to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a tougher action by the church leaders to control the Saudis associated with the Iraq-based Al-Qaida warriors who are fighting against the allied forces and the U.S.-supported Shiti Muslim government.
Al-Qaida's soldiers are considered to be a significant part of the religious leaders of Saudi Arabia who have been involved by the authorities in the support of the government-led royal family policy.
Encouraging the attack by foreign-resident settlements, government buildings and energy industries, Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaida, has been called upon by its warriors to target the Western-Saudi government.
"Safety forces have made huge efforts over the past five months" - declared a public broadcaster from the Ministry of the Interior to the State.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person "media cell" was also caught with the aim of spreading a "takfir idea". Tacfir thinking is the ideology of sunnita Muslim radicals, which supports violence against the unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
There were also 32 arresters who were accused of financial support from the militants.
The climate of Venus can provide an outlook for the future of the earth.
Scientists last night concluded that Venus could once have provided pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European circulatory spaceship suggest that this planet would be seen as much more of the world’s world’s carbonic twin sister than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet in the world.
Given the size of the two planets, it is almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists today believe that several billion years ago, Venus's life conditions on Earth could and could have been very similar to those of Earth and that housing conditions could have been given.
However, because of the super high carbon impact, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the lower rotation rate of the planet, Venus has entered a radically different course of development.
Today, the water has submerged from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and the winds and lightning storms of a hurricane are being destroyed.
The findings of the European Agency's Venus Express space probe, on the basis of a year's study of the planet, are a refreshing picture of how disaster-related changes like those on Earth can develop.
Fred, professor of the University of Oxford Physics Department, who is also a Head of the Venus Express mission, said: "Show me why the climate of Venus is so different from the world's experience, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar structures.
"With our new data, it has been possible to create a screenplay on the development of Venus billions of years ago, when it could have had a situation similar to the Earth that could be inhabited.
You've been arrested by police in a "poisoned uranium" by police.
A kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson does not confirm whether this is about enriched uranium, but he claimed that the substance could have been sold for $1 million (EUR 480 000).

Mitt Romey said it was not worthy of a candidate for a presidential election to answer questions from a butcher.
However, the candidates of the Presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their questions and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night of November 28th proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked about global warming in the debate on the other party's YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time well reflected the position of the Republican Party approaching the elections next year.
It is not yet known exactly how the CNN producers co-financed the debate have selected the applicants to submit the YouTube labels on the basis of which they have submitted the candidates.
The longest issue covering the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republics' female couples.
CNN asked for some uncertain votes to call a number if they heard a whimpering thing: the broker had a high level of agreement when candidates had made a strong statement on the issue of borders.
The busiest and longest debate took place between Rudy Giuliani, the leading national leader, and Rome, a pioneer of key priorities in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture of him handling the issue of illegal immigration too easily during his New York mayor.
He accused Romany of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house by the former Governor of Massusetts.
The conversation between the two of them became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in supporting "Amnestia" (which would ensure that illegal immigrants are in constant status and that citizenship is possible).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as the California Members of Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo, have managed to take a thorough look at this subject.
And although none of them are likely to be marked, their remaining in the race track may be justified by the fact that they began to ring the bell of immigration earlier and louder than before.
There is at least a broad consensus on the immigration issue among candidates: the common objective is to strengthen borders and to work hard on illegal immigrants.
This subject, as well as the fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from outside the world, will help the Republics to forget or minimise the understanding between the Liberals and the Christian Conservatives.
However, when other issues of different nature were raised, the debate was by no means the result of a debate.
Giulani had to face the question of why he previously supported the arms control.
Mr McCain and Mr Romey argued about the question of whether the simulated strangling should be considered as torture.
Another question was whether candidates would believe all the words of the Bible.
On this issue, Giuliani, who finally took a stand at the point of view of considering the Bible as his favorite book, would perhaps not literally mean the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first to take the lead in this Iowa election, who convinced a Christian to remain convinced - against the expectations that the death penalty would be painful, but it was necessary to do so.
When they were wondering if Jesus would receive sufficient support from him, he said that he was better than he was going to be in the election.
Competition is still under way.
Huckabee iowa’s enthusiastic recovery coincides with the financial operations of the Liberal Ron Paul and the enthusiastic cheering of the Wednesday’s debate.
The emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate for the most recent and traditional principles of the aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who, in time and convincingly, was advocating the victory message that preached the great size of the United States and who found the common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is united, and the consequences of this are currently invisible.
Custom Pains
There is another gap ahead of you; the way out is unchanged.
Compared to the British political scandals, the current situation does not seem too pious.
No one gave his honor, no politicians have ever had the Paris hotel accounts, no one has committed an out-of-married scandal.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman has contributed more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over a period of four years to the Work Party, governor of Great Britain, and that this party has not reported on this party, was one of the things that the underprivileged West Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the guarantor escaped the election, and when, by saying that public opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, he thought unmistakably about the intellectual ability of the British, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, who came forward with more and more positive remarks, noted that he became Mr. Bean, from the formerly feared Stalin Brown, into Mr. Bean.
The Northern Rock has brought regulatory weaknesses and judgmental shortcomings into a crossroads of the leftovers to save a bank in Northern Rock.
Minor proposals for changes to the tax law have led business groups to cooperate with the government.
The loss by the tax authorities of 25 million people's personal data has apparently revealed a large administrative failure.
In the House of Lords there were three peace-keeping generals who protested to reduce the budget of the army, claiming that the Minister of Defence's position is part-time employment.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (former Head of Staff) has already resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown cannot turn back on the exit road.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance is inevitable.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes into power, they usually stop their infidelity.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is most likely not to be able to get things straight, and perhaps he will not remain in his position for a long time, the end of the suspended disbelief: the civil servant's will begin to leak, the Ministers will be briefed, the press will look at the bad-mouthed news, and the government will start defending and unable to concentrate.
In a sense, this is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood", unlike "fresh blood".
As much as he wishes to participate in the relationship with Tony Blair, he had his right hand as well.
For example, problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax authorities’ notes relate to decisions taken during Brown’s Finance Ministry.
And although there was no direct involvement in any other type of action - such as an ongoing investigation of the relationship between the "no cash" issue and political party financing - the voters may rightly assume otherwise.
Although Barry's situation is really embarrassing, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The shootings committed are not as scary as they are indicated in the section below.
As in Mr. Bean's case, no one died, no one was caught directly by Mr. Bean.
And compensation - as much as pain is involved - can be the creation of the promised realities of Stalin, who lives in Brown: reliable, solid and hard-handed governance.
For example, it is a good example of a faithful man around political charity.
The Garboan-based Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, stated that he did not want to make a good statement to the public.
Perhaps so, however, the decision to make was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the appointment of major political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks at the doors of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams' action, however, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interviews; just as Van Medleson, the founding director of the Labour Party, also known about the confused donations in October.
To turn, however, for the time being, they do not lead the threads: there is no indication that they knew about these coils, even though the huge sums were paid after the entry into office of June of June.
So far, he has completed half of his premier's task.
He condemned the offence committed by his party even soon, but his firmness was diluted by the fact that he was using a familiar instrument; he entrusted the committee to investigate the matter - for the sake of security - with the leadership of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the "teachable lesson" is not too complicated.
In the event of an offence, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to fix other matters, such as the appointment of the chairman of the Unified Committee on Administrative Regulations, acting without a six-month leader, or the pre-requisite of effective reform of political party financing.
This would require cooperation between the hard-fished Workers' Party and cooperation with the markets and break up with the special financial relationships associated with associations - this would be a tough piece for the Red party.
But you should face some of the measures relating to the party.
According to the surveys, the Conservatives currently have a major advantage; Brown has two years to recover the voters behind him; only way to solve the victory is absolute integrity and strong competence.

Are you threatened by the second market mortgage credit market crisis in America's credit market?
If blood comes into the water, it is natural that sharks will appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, predators focus on the country's credit market.
Analysts of the Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage loan crisis incurs other forms of retail loans, the loss of the credit market can reach up to USD 99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the description rate of the rate of indemnity loans increased and the default rate of late payments beyond 30 days.
The HSC reported a loss of USD 1.4 billion last month in the US consumer financing segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, the Panic is still premature.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
A Moody's credit rating agency shall pay a late payment rate of 3,89 % for the third quarter of a total percentage point below the quarterly average.
In part, the reduction in the rates can be explained by technical measures.
The change in the U.S. rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency depositors, although it caused large losses in the credit card market; a re-growth in the number of bankruptcy claims (and this description ratio) is expected, whether or not the total amount of terms and conditions for the purchase is deteriorated or not.
The rate of payment, which shows the ratio of monthly credit transfers to consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, confidence in securities covered by credit cards is quite strong, despite the paralysed nature of structured financing in other areas of finance.
Moreoney at the TowerGroup research company estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year's.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit market are clear: consumers raise debt on credit cards in order to pay mortgage loans.
However, issuers mainly monitor cash flow and not asset value, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily cause the creditors to change their creditworthiness.
The development of the situation can also benefit the investors.
If the value of the property is less than the value of the mortgage credit, the incentive for consumers to transfer credit will be reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will take precedence over the priority.
Changing interest rates or credit limits allows card issuers to adapt more quickly and more easily to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-price of assets.
"It is unlikely that one day we are going to completely re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Financial Director of Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit market is unlikely, the risk of a gradual decline would be more likely.
If the decline in house prices and the fall in credit bring America into a recession, the industry will certainly look forward to a dramatic future.
It is appropriate to monitor those predatoric fins.
British bankers have found themselves guilty of Enron's case.
On Wednesday, he confessed to the guilt of the three British bankers who were brought to justice to investigate their role in fraud against the name of Enron’s former financial director, Andrew Fasten.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially found to be innocent in the charge of scheduled fraud, which is believed to have cooperated with Fastow in a covert fraud committed in 2000, which was intended to gain money at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing, the U.S. judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them, admitted their guilt in the same order of fraud.
Three of the former employees of the Group of the Bank of Scotland Company of the Greenwich NatWest have become known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation of the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
In 2002, he warned Fastow that he was one of the victims of a government investigation to investigate Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers who were baptized as "the Three of NatWest" were on their way to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who was then the right hand of Fastow and Fastow.
Fastow, who is responsible for designing numerous frauds involving Enron, also controlled the Enro subsidiary in which it was invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of the shares existing in the subsidiary, but three-bit men knew that interest was very high.
A Kopper-controlled company bought the bank's share of the company's assets of USD 1 million in the subsidiary.
The creditors paid Kopper $25 million to acquire a share in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow wrongly informed Enron that the energy company buys the 20 million-dollar subsidiary share of the company from Greenwich NatWest.
However, in fact, the $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution claims that the bankers were 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his dual guilt for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The three of them were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
He spends two or three years and a month in a prison in texarkan.
Three English men each may have been travelling to the United States, with a 1 million-dollar deposit, during the trial period, to the United States of America.
Enron, the first largest company in the United States of America, declared bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks, could no longer cover the millions accumulated as a debt, or the companies declared to be profitable, but in fact, loss-making.
Thousands of jobs have disappeared due to collapse, the market value has fallen by more than $60 billion and the value of pension funds has decreased by more than USD 2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and the former CEO, Jeffrey Skling, were sentenced last year for their bankruptcy in the company's bankruptcy.
Skling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ended with the death of a man last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow. There is no poverty in Moscow.
Over $54 million will start with a Gulfstream G550 machine equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, which will make the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
However, for some Russian rich people, this amount is only a small amount of money.
Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream, said: "18 travels in it."
"But no one orders such meetings because the machines are bought for private families or companies."
Mr. Firer has counted on visitors at the purchase of the four-day, exclusive, Millionaires, held in a huge exhibition hall in the neighbourhood of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other commercial goods suppliers rent a stand at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new owners will be interested in everything from the mahogany-covered yachts to the diamond-covered 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a good car, but it's not going to follow our products," he said.
"Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States."
The capital of the city seems to swim in money like Dallas did in the light of the earthquake.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some US millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered to be material here." said Marshall Goldman, senior scholarship to the Davis Centre of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Japanese gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and the 1990s, the Russians have now become the world's most spectacular poets.
The most exclusive brands demand a share of the gold fever.
At another conference organised by the industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnalt, President of the LVMH, gave his opinion on how to sell high value products on markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of wealthiest people in Russia, there are 53 billion people who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-rate Russian millionaires reaches 103 000, which could amount to a total of $670 billion, has been established by a study conducted by the economics of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyses personal well-being developments in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's data show that in 2005 there was 15.8 percent of the number of people living under the minimum age in Russia.)
"More than a million million people live in Moscow, which is why we are all here" said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole took part in the sale for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are inseparably cared for, and men are a real treasure mine."
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, in the same evening dress, were classified as a millionaire by both themselves and their customers.
"I looked at the cars and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who was stunned in a custom-designed uniform dress, as if she had already become accustomed to this recovery.
The sale was mainly arranged for new owners, brand-oriented Russian buyers who were willing to visit after several hours in circulation a large-scale, cifran-filled place where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum platters, Mintenpick ice cream, conventional billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund plüss Bears at the same time.
For ordinary people, the ticket costs 30 euros ($47).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was a patriot who took a special seat at the stand of the Dutch china producer, Royal Delft, compared to a large, hand-painted, blue-painted Rembrandt copy.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the phenomenal things."
Indeed, the salesmen here have said that long (by Russian standards that is 10-15 years) the rich Russians have already moved from the outstanding time to the limited number of brands made in bagattels that would not be admitted to a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, each of them million millionaires, millionaires’ agents and tourists spent every day in the area until the crowding.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Tuesday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil Bedding Company told me that he sold two mats of silk, cashmere and cotton, each of which is $70 000 a day.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, salesman of A1 Moto with a modern alarm for the supply of high-quality cars, reported that his company sold $170 000 to a Russian million-dollar Russian millionaire for the bright orange Porsche.
Andrei Karapetian, a motor vehicle manufacturer supplying unique requirements, sold three fridges to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon on the Sunday afternoon of the L.A. Connection. The bars are similar to interconnectors and cost 55,000 dollars each.
The reporters were also shown a wheel made for the owner of a Russian casino, which according to Swarovski has been drawn with crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
One four-piece set price: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to see wheels made of leather and his wife's face made of a circonial stake, will not necessarily use these objects." said Karapetian.
"That way he'll keep them in the 30-way car guard's garage."
Despite the fact that many Russian clients are rich, the term "Russian millionaires" is not a great privilege these days, given the rapid rise in the prices of properties there.
"Who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is most likely a millionaire today, if not in cash, but at least on paper."
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have caused the appearance of wealth in front of the Alliance Continal's Russian trust firm.
The company has set up four English-style telephone phones that have been collected with millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Ahad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told me that his team printed 500 thousand fake banknotes on the Millionaires' Buyer.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with the money, and many took photos of themselves with a mobile phone as they were stretching in the money chain or simply putting a few million in the pocket.
"See, in Moscow everyone may feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
There is a suspicion of a surgical error behind a death in New York City.
The day before Thanksgiving, it happened that Ronald Livingston looked like "Just a Little More Than" on the couch of the floor and saw a rescue car stop on Cape Cod by two doors down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly later.
another one.
"After seeing the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, a inspector working at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"I knew then that someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo.
The investigation is currently under way to determine whether death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police, who worked without an authorisation under 212 West Road Avenue.
The authorities have not yet managed to find out what was causing Arroya's death, but hope that the results of the toxicology tests that become available a few weeks later will highlight this mysterious death, which has greatly affected the high-ranking staff of the New York Police.
Arroyo, whose voice has been known to the department by many people, has been working as an assistant to the Director of the Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, busy and reliable" - said McCarthy Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"..he was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, who was previously a police officer in New York, currently working in the Committee on the Control of Spirit Products, and left two sons, 14 and 11-year-old boys and a stepdaughter behind her.
Eileen Walsh, the spokesperson of Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow stated that the investigators were working to find out whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgical intervention by an author.
"Probability stands" said Walsh.
"The investigation is ongoing."
The public authorities' reports show that they arrived at the house at 3 p.m. on November.
It was found on the couch on 21st and 21st and Arroyo.
He was already declared dead at the scene.
Over a week has passed, and so far the police have told us very little about the investigation and about the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not talk about whether Castro was heard by the detectives.
The study participants are looking into whether part of the house has been functionalized as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro's home, where there was a frenzy rosebock standing in the narrow garden and a barking from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the pen, in the driveway there was a blue container with the words "Etil Vaninin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes from hooks to the left side.
McCarthy recalled when, after 25 years at the New York Police Department, she first arrived in Newark, Mrs Arroyo was an inestimable help in helping her to learn about the unusual and unspoiled political history of the new city.
"Always he said, "This and that's better to be taken care of!" - an exhibition.
"He was always here when I arrived this morning, and he was still in there when I left last night.
It was a mess."
Fed's interest rate expectations lead to an increase in world market share markets.
The stock prices jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, following the comforting statements by the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank, which gave rise to the hope that Fed will make it easier to invest with further interest.
The stock markets both in London and New York and across Europe, after Donald Kohn, who claimed to be the right hand of the Fed President Ben Lannka, had to respond to the "flexibly and pragmaticly" concern on the financial markets.
In addition to the clear aim of Kohn’s goal of controlling the markets in the light of the signs of the recovery credit crisis, he stated that the current anxiety " partly reintroduced the progress achieved in the market at the end of September and October."
He said that if the increased disturbance persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the environment of households and companies.
The statements were considered by the investors to be ready to provide fresh capital for the US markets or even for additional interest payments in order to stabilise the environment.
The statements also calmed down on Wall Street, which is more than just bad news about the American economy, such as the poor record of the number of U.S. housing sales.
The side effect of financial concern is also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will release 650 employees and 4 percent of its global workforce in order to offset losses in the second-market housing sector in the United States, as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs per 1 500 workers in London are covered by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones average industrial index increased by 330 points, 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the larger S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306,2 and increased the value of the British blue-chip companies by more than 39 HUF.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 per cent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
The financial market disturbance was renewed after the high-speed auction organised by the European Central Bank on paper with a three-month maturity not seen since April 2001 at a price of 4.7 percent for European banks.
After having reached the highest level of 6,59 % since September, following the steady increase in the interbank interest rate in England after 12 November, Libor has all exerted greater pressure on the Bank of England to follow Fed and the ECB and to put an average on the money market in London.
In England, the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopar between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopari and Ravi Bopari is called for in England.
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other one.
Who should be the English team's main field in Candy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopa?
And by the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision, does it not matter who does not make the decision?
The latter question is, firstly, because David Graveney, the President of the electors, who temporarily performs this particular task, will assist the leader Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision.
Of the two players, draw the shortest one that doesn't get the sixth bat, but as you know, life, and most of the sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell you what the height of a person's profession is, while no other person can get past a lower level, often it's more about luck than about talent.
It is also not characteristic of the cricket that it is difficult to select - often on a subjective basis - on a very difficult basis.
Has the time come for Bopara to move forward?
Is it true about Shah if this happens?
The same question may be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, with two smart, well-trained young people, who know business well-known, would put the decision-makers before them, while only one of them has room for one of them.
Can you tell what level a cricket player takes without being thrown into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, the data greatly influence the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player must get the captain's eyes on the cricket cap at the right moment, and a bat should be given a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player once.
It's a lot more complicated to catch the sight of the voters.
For example, more than James Anderson have played better in the last season, but he still expects to be a team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison himself says he's in good shape and he's doing very well.
Anderson hit 32 first-class gates with a hit and 33 runs on the tour.
Chris Tremlet only hit 29, but each of them had successful moments at the highest level, and hope they will be like this in the future.
If Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well, they will decide on this on the basis of their opinions.
This decision may reinstate or break anyone's career, but it may not have a specific impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankán Gareth Batty performed well on every test and with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, became an outstanding and decisive test mirrorer, who is perhaps still underrated even today, even though he scored two hundred points in Australia against the Australians.
It is likely that, listening to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, in their discussion during today’s game in Asgiriya State, they will use much more experience with Shah’s voice, compared to the young life force and dynamics of Bopar.
the arguments put forward by the Commission in the present case.
The bright and successful debut of the 88-bombay test quarters is in favour of Shah's seven years younger than the 22-year-old Bopar's sixth, who also had an outstanding twist in throws, he achieved 32-year-old casts.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies in May at home in Lorda, and that Vaughan, who was fighting for the next game, was fighting against the immediate opposition of the voters, seems to have reduced the ten-quarter resistance that was evident in Bombay.
In contrast with him, the universal talent of Essex is a life-sacred and unsuspecting player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the cricket track, but the outside attitude was well characterised by when an exhibition blew up with a four-wheel drive by the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did after doing so was to take hold of Vodafone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his close-observed teammate Alistair Cook, Alastair Cook, to ask him: "See this?"
Bopara classics are a better team player. Its mid-steps have a favourable pitch angle, and its punches are confident and clever.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another for the right moment.
Maybe this is the true art of the selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be a great one if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one that's supposed to be this weekend.
They're transporting the refugees home by vans to work and fight Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, in Baghdad, Syria, the first buses have arrived with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or have expired their visa, or actually, those who hope that the city has restored its order.
There are also those who have come back to fight those soldiers who have driven them away from their houses.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled with dozens of buses has arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sunnit Doctor of Sabah al-Qubai.
"Today I returned because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the news and that the city is now safe.
He added, referring to Moqudata al-Sadr milicist minister who has now stopped his Shiita army, who has stopped him.
The 38-year-old Shiti teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who lived mostly from Amaryah, lived in Sunni, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from taking up work there.
Amarija’s ski neighbors called him and urged him to return, saying that with the help of the troops supported by the Americans, Al-Qaida has been pushed out of their cabin in the north of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a sunnit and Shiita tribal leader who escaped from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad, before a grenade attack, after he started encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
Harvest came back again.
"Two days ago, my friends called and said that they had created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed to support me and my sons.
I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obodi.
A lot of people have talked about the increased peace in the capital since the entry of the American troops and the strong civilian forces working with the Americans lured them home.
However, more people have escaped from Damascus due to visa and financial problems related to the return from Damascus.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voiced the widespread view among refugees that the ski director Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the refugee's visa application to force their return.
They believe that more than two and a half million people have escaped the nation's death row.
"It was all right until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government not to issue more visas for Iraqis to return home," said the Sunnita retired.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I fled."
One of the reasons for the lightening of violence is that the sunnits were deported from the ski areas, while the skis also left the sunnit areas.
Many people are afraid that the sudden appearance of refugees is going to upset the plains again, which could lead to more fights.
Out-of-occupational education in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
The lowest federal region plays a leading role in vocational education and training, and its higher education is also an international orientation.
Only in one field of training do island-rurals experience the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"The day before, I told a non-Charterlander that we were not Frenchs" - this on the posters of the self-reeling slogg, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entire federal state.
France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saarland region, which, according to the surveys of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne (IW), can be the fifth place of praise.
Thus, higher education institutions – not only because of traditions but also because of traditions – work closely with neighbouring countries.
The island university was founded by the French in 19th April.
Today, students can complete their studies here with two or three diplomas.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15,6 % higher than that of foreign students.
However, the island-rural students are also encouraged to learn at an extra average level by the colleges and universities of Saar county - many of them have no secondary school education.
"The opportunities for vocational training are exploited in the Saar region", explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Economic Institute.
Young people get more than a fifth degree in education and training, which in the Saarland region exceeds the federal average by more than seven percent.
The opportunities for a combination of vocational and higher education and training have also been well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is situated in the second place within Germany in terms of population.
Despite practical training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the island region has therefore imposed on the higher education institutions a marketing campaign, with the focus on engineering science.
"In general school, we have made a number of reforms following the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
This government has introduced cross-border comparative tests.
To allow children to start learning in the past, the last school year is free of charge, a model that, in the meantime, has begun to climb across the rest of the federal provinces.
Whether learners' performance will improve permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
On the basis of the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of learners at risk shrinked from 29 to 20 percent from 29%.
However, overall the performance of the rural area has not improved to the same extent as that of the rest of the federal provinces.
The mustaches count.
The greatest poverty of island-regions in the Pisa survey will not take into account the knowledge of foreign language - otherwise, they could harvest extravaganzas in this area,
The language of the neighbouring countries in the upper secondary schools is mandatory - even if the island-country people are not French.
Chávez will change the clocks.
In Venezuela in the near future, clocks will be different from those in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, the President of Hugo Chávez will turn the indicators back to Latin America half an hour ago.
In the meantime, Chávez in Spain became the object of laughter.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela said, under a new law, the hours will be rescheduled four and a half hours from the time of greenwichi.
Thus, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
Among other reasons, the anti-US Chávez reasoned its decision that the United States forced the whole hourly time zones to the world.
Chavez announced, on Wednesday, that the relations with neighboring Colombia would be interrupted due to a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that, until the conservative Alvaro Uri remains President of Colombia, neither the Prime Minister nor the Colombian Government will be in contact with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this for my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the country of oil must make an opinion within the framework of a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly develop power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist ambassadors.
Uribe's decision to "arcul küpte" Venezuela gave a voice to his critic Chávez Sunday.
In fact, everyone is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new voice called "Por Qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up), sounds like the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet for themselves.
The sentence originates from Charles John, King of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin-American summit by the constant intervention of the populist politician in the leftolda that he put me in his voice in this way.
In 2007, the Germans were threatened by a rent drop in 2007 and were threatened by Germans.
It is believed that a real-time drop in prices threatens German workers this year, despite the strong contour.
Experts have supported their pessimistic forecast with a limited amount of justification.
According to Hans-Bröckler-Siteming Standards, in 2007, employees can actually count less wages than in the previous year.
"The reason for this modest trade, the increase in the overall turnover tax and the rapid increase in food and energy prices is because of this," said Gustav Horn of the "Bild" daily, a member of the Macroeconomic and Economic Research Institute.
There may also be additional burdens on workers regarding unemployment insurance.
Peter Steinbrück Minister of Finance stated in a statement made by the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the current situation is to reduce correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year's unemployment insurance.
In any event, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult position to apply for loans or subsidies to the alliance, they quoted the German Socialist Party, the SPPD politician.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In comparison to the annual average price increased by a total of 3 per cent.
Venus is one of Earth’s Earth’s Earth’s Paradise twin brothers and sisters.
In spite of Venus's vortex atmosphere, it is more like the Earth than it has been assumed to be: In the atmosphere of the European "Venus Express", lightning discharges, and in the ants, it has discovered winds such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
Over the past three decades, scientists assume that Venus is lightninging down.
The European "Venus Express" space probe has discovered electromagnetic waves around the atmosphere: The lightnings in Vénes range from 56 kilometers to a cloud at a height, reports Christpher Russ, a staff member of the Loss University of England, on the branches of the Science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "rich theory", Earth life was created by lightning: according to the theory, the storms caused reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of the building blocks of amino acids and life.
Not by Vénészon: "If there ever was life there, it was very early," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there is hardly any living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere on the wheels is even more dense than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that Venus may be the world's hell twin brother, but also his twin brother," he stated to Russ.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, as much as the size and weight of the Earth, is passing on a completely different course of development.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research because no probe has been on the way since the early '70s to explore this planet.
In the opinion of researchers, the latest research results presented in more "Nature" articles show not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system but also the uniqueness of Venus.
"They also point out that the likeness of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we thought it would be," said the Esa.
In addition to the well-known Northern Swimstone, researchers have also discovered a cloud that is moving much faster in the South Swims.
The phenomenon resembles the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, reports the study group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second largest planet in the solar system is almost the same as that of the Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is nearly as large as the Earth.
The celestial body, also known as the Earth Star, will avoid the sun for a period of up to 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly around its own waist: a day of retirement lasts 243 days on earth.
Although the surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius associated with Venus 92 b.p.p. resembles Earth, scientists begin by creating both planets under conditions that are entirely similar to those found on both planets.
They all had water collected, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while Véneszon passed into the universe.
And while CO2 on Earth was bound in carbon dioxide mattes, Véneson is a large part of this atmosphere.
She wants to protect Köhler against Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Köhler, the President of the Republic of Germany, calls for the end of the debate between the parties surrounding the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
In the meantime, he criticised the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September reception.
Horst Köhler, President of the German Republic, is concerned about Germany's authority and has called for the major coalition to end the debate on the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this matter, we should not be seen as a divided nation towards the outside world," he declared to Köhler the Handelsblatt magazine.
Köhler at the same time expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel (EDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
" Human rights are universally valid even if I respect the diversity between cultures", Köhler pulled him down.
He is aware that Germany needs to take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, emphasised the President of the Republic; however, Merkel is defending against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break with the traditional "China" policy.
China is aware of this," Köhler stated.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier Minister for Foreign Affairs (SPD) also expressed his disapproval over the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union's ranks.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the EU's "kiracat policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the adoption of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, severe disturbances occurred in German-China relations.
Thus, not only did Peer Steinbrück (SPD) return the invitation of the German Minister for Finance, but according to SPIEGEL, he also frozen the so-called Strategic Communication between the Foreign Ministry of the two countries.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has just called upon the Chancellor of the Union of Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the formal acceptance by European politicians of the Tibetan religious leader, confirmed by Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that it is trying to break up Tibet and other Tibetan territories, including other provinces of China.
Säble avoids interferences similar to those in France.
Street clashes with the police, shootings, burning cars: Jungang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to street violence, demands the Federal Minister of Interior.
Barricades were on fire, tramers fired at the police with a funny rifle: After serious nuisances by young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior (DCU) in Shanghai Schäuble, Germany, is concerned with similar developments.
"We must make sure that the social explosive does not build up in our house and that it does not become violent.
We have to take this seriously", he said to the newspaper "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Allies, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have been shown."
However, it is too early to release the emergency.
At the same time, he suggested that the German suburbs do not have urban and sociological problems such as those in France.
In recent nights in the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been fighting serious street wars with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings are burning too.
In view of this, the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish German Communities, has required a greater degree of activity in terms of integration.
In France, Kolat warned me about the "threat threats" of persecution.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
action is still necessary.
There was a concern that among young people under 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate was "higher than average".
All in all, more places of education should be provided.
Kolkat stressed that "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
However, the leader of the Turkish community added that "the social security of the family" in Germany is much more present than in France.
Moreover, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their families have built here.
Cola warns: "However, we must be alert."
For young people "it is necessary to provide as soon as possible the possibility of having a job and receiving education."
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, in the Villiers-le-Bel, full rest was found during the night.
Officers were on their way to launch, and an aircraft headlamp was cramming the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flaming garbage cans and cars.
Since reporting, a safety unit of 1000 in a round has been providing for peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, and have announced that Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Home Affairs, after visiting the suburbs.
In the night of Tuesday night, in the wake of the villiers-le-bel riots, 80 officers were injured in a round area of 80 officers.
The next night, the tensions have spread to Touloutuse.
The revolution broke out in a road accident, during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
The State's Attorney General's first finding is that the police are not liable for the death of young people.
Cloud in the realm of Angela's empire.
The chancellor's action has been pushed away from the reality of the fact that the coalition is at the end - and it is no longer expected to be anything.
In fact, in any case, does the federal chancellor live in another country?
It is necessary to determine, after taking part in the general discussion of the Bundestag, whether it is important or not, whether it is not here - not in the country whose governance it is to do with.
With a very modest sentence, he rejected the prosecution, Angela Merkel, that he would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is pro-vintial, replying, and in this way all he has expressed is that he does not want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how good the eye-dryings are.
In the meantime, neither particular interest nor empathy were sensitive to the country's problems.
Instead, the Cloudy Angel has emerged: a politician who is pushed away from reality who is fleeing to foreign policy and who is his only source of uncertainty.
The example of climate protection is that Heiligendamm makes a huge contribution to its praise and listens to how to achieve its climate goals in the country.
Even so, as far as self-respect is concerned, such modestness would not have been allowed by the CDU president two years ago.
Now he's clinging to the fact that prosperity has a positive effect on humans.
This has caused the good news of a pragmatic personality that can solve problems instead of word flowers.
However, in the realm of Angela the cloudy empire of domestic policy problems are only marginal matters.
Poverty and the problems of the low incomes?
He simply welcomes this for a few half-words.
In this regard, it is a great deal of talk about how often it will be done when it comes to family allowances.
On many occasions, Merkel has to insist on bringing together a half-way softfoot sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he's in a foreign area.
Convulsions department
During the debate by the Presidents of the Republic at YouTube, the two favorts, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romene, have been subjected to a severe blow - and now they must be held from an external candidate.
The tension of candidates has already surfaced on the first subject.
Mitt Romany turns up against Rudy Giulian, who made her a "migration of illegal immigrants" in New York.
"I would say that his own house was a place for illegal immigrants", he cut Giuliani back, and it is called Massachusetts's former governor's eyes that he has no documents of self-employed immigrants.
Candidates are on the move: As the Republican camp still has no consistently supported Favorite, the presidential debate at the CNN will be used first and foremost to undermine the loan of its opponent.
Self-recorded 30-second videos sent by Internet users via YouTube are far more than brief summarys.
"We have brought Hitler to power by this type of isolacionism," he rubs John McCain under the nose of Ron Paul, who demands the immediate exit from Nána as the only one of the participants of the circle.
Romany's head will also be thoroughly washed by a venetian vet who is reluctant to condemn the so-called "Wateringing" as a torture, the interrogation method during which the strangulation is simulated.
However, while the important topics of the campaign are still in addition to the debates on Iraq and torture, it is shown by the reactions of the St. Petersburg audience in Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room when conservative values are praised and when future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the skins of the two candidates are becoming more and more visible.
"I was wrong at the time", he was penniless Romany and apologized to the supporters and the television viewers for having even made a decision in 1994 to interrupt the pregnancy.
Giulani, however, is agitated when he is asked to express his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first leader of a civilian civilian who is the leader of Musharraf.
One day after his withdrawal from the army's lead, it took place as President Musharraf, President of Pakistan, who was in power in Pakistan.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Mr Pervez Musharraf, had a request for another five-year term of office on Thursday.
The Pakistani television from the capital, from the Presidential Palace of Islam, was live in the transmission of the ceremony.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and that he would do something for his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his trustee, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed international pressure from the United States of America to come first.
After breaking into power in the form of a military coup, the former next eight years without bloodshed, he now governs the first time as a civilian Head of State.
Musharraf has made the withdrawal of the armed forces as commander-in-chief of a fundamental claim by the West and the Opposition.
Another important need is the abolition of the emergency condition, which was published on 3 November in Musharraf.
According to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will remove the state of emergency shortly after the end of his insurrection, with which he will make a further claim to the guarantor.
The Supreme Court of the country, to which Musharraf has sat at the beginning of November at the moment of the extraordinary state of play, has rejected last week any objection to the reelection of the Prime Minister's appeal of 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers have been killed and four others injured following an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal area in North Asia.
According to information provided by the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghan border.
Akrautrock's father returns.
The 70th-century German superpower: Three gang members of Harmia re-enacted their instrument until a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the re-construction, a cut tape appears from their light, from the time of "Live 1974".
They were well known abroad at that time.
The reported sensation has killed the bodies of the three agreed gentlemen who are visiting the table.
Each of them has its own instrument, its own note and above all its own button.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of his 63-year-old in white shirts.
Michael Rother, who is a young person from the past 57 years, provides a service in the possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the point of view of the audience, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and concentrates on the console.
Each and every one of them is making some kind of noise, while at the same time it's a rhythm.
And all of this is going to be about randomly traditional music.
However, all of this does not seem to interfere with the employees themselves in particular.
A great deal has been said to the believers of the Krautrock Music Community that Harmonia is re-sing the band.
What we can tell us here: As a result of appropriate follow-up, we can conclude that the name has fallen through the collective pop memory, but by no means has left any lasting traces of the fact that after 32 years we are painfully missing this band.
But why can't the Germans celebrate their seventies?
Especially that what we call a cataract indirectly, in England and America, has always been more valued than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Life Acquist Award to the still living members of Can collage in 2003, the German pop figures were sitting in the room with an inconclusive face.
Even the La Dusseldorf and the Neu!, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers presented his thanks to the La Dusseldorf and the Neu!, the suspicion became infinite.
On the concerts, Michael Roth used to sit on the stage as an old friend with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The two sides of the same coin are the two sides of the domestic rejection and the foreign acceptance.
It is only because the Trio existed for two years, and during this time it has had a far less impact than others have done for him since then.
Moebius and Roedelius have already performed with Conrad Schnitzler with an artist under the name of the much-prospect Cluster.
Originally, they played under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then, in Dusseldorf, from economics to a record company financed by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band in the short term, and yet, at the same time, it was perhaps the most radical German band in the world, the Neu! guitar member.
Rother, however, followed the Cluster's musicians into their exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th century in Rome as a Communist renegade from the city.
Less ideology than in communication I, where Roedelius was still a CO.
Their lives are more like an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of the Harmonia Otenstein altar came from the trash and was thus found a name for their nature.
Some of these things have been laid down by Harmonia.
The title of the first album is "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is "De Luxe."
Despite his loose and modest music, the group was in financial need.
The looters alone did not ensure that they were found by themselves.
The CD was recorded in the title "Live 1974" at a concert in Griesem, in front of an audience with a record of only 50 people, so someone remembers.
Harmonia's push and occasional practice at the time was Roth's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The gang announced the break-up of the band in 1975.
Rother ended up at the ostore and held himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster is a resuscitation in the '80s, which has been more successful since then than Harmony has ever been.
Griesem is a live album thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, who is a student of the Grenland name, set the goal of caring for the Krautrock as a special German feed for live music.
As part of this process, Neu! has already been planned as part of the Roedelius Treaty.
The Harmonia's resurrection will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
By means of an instrument, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the author's book "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
There is also the manager of Loveparade, Dr. Mette, who is also present.
The impact of the krautrock on the next pop music era is largely illustrated by this.
In this respect, Harmonia fills out the rest of the space reserved for the main team.
Briano's determination, along with the most unusual voices, is floating in the room: "The only true music, it's the future."
There are pictures that represent the producer with Harmonia in a peasant's room.
The screening of further black and white photos of the equipment in the course of the course is intended to help the construction of the design.
In particular, the three veterans take over the improvisation again.
This merely means that microphones are fixed to the organ and to the drum equipment with the intention of using the sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments that produce the sound effects of the instruments themselves, using their own escalating sound effects.
Today the electric music looks like electric music.
Three deep-seated interstellars.
This doesn't change anything even the house hour.
Under the leadership of the Mayor, they cough and pummel, and sing "Aaaaaaaaah" with a beautiful part of it.
For the Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought no less in blues than in the Academy of Music (Can), in the knowledge of science (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here calls out "'68", he doesn't go the wrong way, and Harmonia doesn't even let herself out of his mind right now.
Even the most obvious thing on the stage is carefully considered.
Where does the music start, and where does it end?
This nerve can drive you crazy, or you can offer it to you at the moments of the extraordinary day.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through the "Charvest" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the war in the Balkans again.
However, none of them are convinced.
The basic thinking, or too much, is aimed at action and shooting, or is too glamorous.
Even now, Dee can't help us in the "Warming".
First of all, although the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, still there, in the dark background of the war in Bosnia, they found the actor Gere again.
In recent times, we lost sight of the likes of the 80's, because many good boys and many press conferences in the area of Buddhism have still taken our pleasure in finding out about them.
And here, all of a sudden, the Richard Gere is the ultimate argument, in addition to perhaps even watching the movie "Walding" c.
It offers a wonderful, smiling design: The fact that Simon Hunt, who was formed by him, would have been what Gere could have become if fate and the industry were not so kind: A man who left behind his last years long ago, but as a ruinous monument, retained a significant part of his former charm.
However, the German "Mörderischer Frieden" production, which started this week and also started to be filmed this week, continues only in the endless series of performances about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have much to say: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel), who saves a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly loves her.
It is to be welcomed that for the time being, Serbs are not represented as the only cause of all bad, the film giving the low level of television is too quick to get in the shooting and the event-like scene.
"Cobra 11" is carrying a sign back to the freeway by war.
On the other hand, on the other hand, it is possible to examine in the case of the "Wolfing" why in fact nothing really good about the war in the Balkans has been done.
The three United States military scientists story, who are rounding up to explore the Serbian war criminal who studied the name "Róka", with another director, with another journalist (both in Shepard's personal union) may have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time.
For the stories show a surprising similarity: In any case, small groups cut him into the forest to do what the army can do - and in any case, the insanity journey spins.
One of the reasons for the failure of the "Honest" is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt be the depraved cynical person who listened to his heart, as he shows him at the beginning.
No, and in any case, he also spends a romantic relationship with a future Muslim hags woman.
The "traffic" will be loose when the reporters achieve what NATO, CIA and all the world's bounty hunters were unable to do in five years in the last five minutes of the film: they will capture the war culprit and they will hand him over to the Muslims in the name of fair payback.
It is so bad that man would prefer to go to the Hague International Tribunal for a crime against the logic of cinema.
And their purpose is deeply human.
He intends to place Karajics and Mladics on the loose and suspect the Americans and the French (i.e. they are still exceptionally uniform) that, due to secret political negotiations, they do not continue the persecution intensively enough for the sake of secret political negotiations.
But good and evil are sometimes so much like each other that you can remember a famous Brecht verse.
Here's what the poet writes about the mask of the Asian demon on his desk: "On the head of my watch, the dwindling remover, which tells me how exhausting it is to be bad."
Movies such as the "Creating" have the same oversized, head-shaped masks, which, however, show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the diaphragm of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, the paper reported that all the film on Iraq in Hollywood was a nasty fall.
We can add: There is no good film about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: If a star is on the planet's planets or fields, it appears like "the paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "without borders" with Angelina Jolie or "the Blood Diamond" with Varo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts may still be too close for the time to come.
The decades had to pass until when he was able to film a good movie about the holocaust with the film "Schindler's List".
There are probably a few films in it - since the works of the war in Vietnam, which are now a classic work, such as "Horslayer", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", have not been celebrated in their day as an unsolicited masterpiece.
But it is possible that nowadays, when each of the massacres is in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the reporters of ignoring the reality of what is needed to tell good stories.
In fact, "Fly or not" or "The Doctor" were so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't even know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
You may not be allowed to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should place the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcasticly distant artistic vision.
When they were talking about his historical novel Lemprière and his parallels between the Balkan war, he said, "It's just that things never change.
The cities will always be a terrible threat, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto has been warmly criticized for the fall of the Olympics.
The closing date of the deadline from its invitation to tender for the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg resulted in intense criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to keep fighting for water games.
However, Von Beust is a strong warning to realities during the probabilities.
On Wednesday, the head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, regarded the withdrawal as "undisputed to the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently released such enormous motivational forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
"for this purpose, we could not maintain a level playing field in sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "which is based on modified time coordinates".
You are in favour of the previous statements made by Mayor Beust that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not realistic until at least 2028.
"He will not decide on the Olympics tender, but on the German Olympic Sports Association," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
Referring to the decision of the Sport Association expected at the end of December on the Munich tender for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means that within the period of 2028, which we have considered so far, we will not have real chances."
However, we do not give up the dream forever, he said Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) has expressed its regret at the statements made by Beust.
This gives the impression that, in the next 25 years, the Olympic Games will not be launched in the next 25 years.
"It's too soon to waste a chance to bury our plans", said Günter Ploß, President of the H.B. on Wednesday.
Furthermore, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at the general meeting of the General German College Association.
In fact, the tender submitted to Von Beust Hamburg by the 2015 Universal Fairy submitted that it is not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Association has only started in the last week as a city participating in the call for proposals in Hamburg.
The citizens' group in the SPD has provoked the Senate to leave a valuable period of time unexploited in respect of the building in Hamburg.
"Kleiner Grasbrook's development has been delayed by the Senate for years because he was voting next to the Olympics and did not build the house", said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quarst.
While the SPD continued to break the spear in line with the integrated plan for the Olympic and subsequent arms exploitation of Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU placed emphasis on the "event-factor" at the same time.
The invitation to tender for the Summer Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 was at a time when a great deal of enthusiasm took place in Brussels.
There was a fall in Lipcsé, but it was not in Lipcsé.
These aren't both of them.
The one who links the concepts of Sweden and pheasant to each other is the Ikea, not the Wharf.
What does that mean?
Currently produced in Sweden, pharates cast a dark shadow on the history of the works of Warhoh.
These are the thirty-four "Stoholm Type" Billo Boxs that have been listed here are a large part of the bonds.
After the Swedish newspaper "Exressen" called into question the origin of the Brillo Boxs of 1968 and now the internal investigation of the Modern Museum of Playholm has come to a positive conclusion: in 1995, Hultén Pontus, former Director-General, entrusted to Moderna Museet, a copy of "Brillo Box", and most likely to be a major part of the Brill Box on the international art market.
The history of long and complicated, artistic and curatoric mutations is a confusing chain of malignancy.
In 196 in New York, he created the first "Brillo Box" - paintd on the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder, based on a red-blue and white format.
At his work in the 1968 Moderna Museum, he issued hundreds of Brillo-Lads made of cardboard with the consent of Warhol: These were not from War, but were transported directly from the Brillo-karton factory.
It wasn't a work of art, it was their templates, it was a simple piece of art.
Where in 1968 he gave permission to manufacture some of the Brillo-falads in Sweden, which, however, were not published in the Modern Museum, where he gave permission to manufacture some of them in Sweden.
His witnesses now speak of a round of 15 boxes that were then validated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brilo-Box, under the designation "Stoholm Type", entered art and art history under the mark "Stoholm".
Some of them were auctioned for over 100,000 dollars.
The problem is, however, that Pontus Hultén, the diabolical director of the company, wrongly claimed later on that in 1968, they had produced round-the-walled woodlands and produced them in Sweden, which was then abandoned by Warhoi.
In fact, only in 1990 was Hulten 105's box produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, however, Volt was dead three years ago from where she was dead.
Lars Byström, the main monumental editor of the Moderna Museum, also examined three Swedish private-owned boxes in addition to the six Brillo Box in the museum, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: The printed billboards were first printed and snuffed, followed by brushing of the white paper.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 is about the fact that the paint was carried directly to the sheet without foundation - not only oil but acrylic paint.
"These boxes should be deleted from the official date of Brillo's Box," says Lars Nittve, Director of Modern Museum: "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authority Board of New York decides otherwise, the Modern Museum will be classified as a copy/exhibition material as the six boxes in its collection."
Of course, the Authority Board announced in June that "serious accusations" were raised in connection with the exiting soap dust boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained unruly silent.
Manilai rebel soldiers surrender.
They gave up the attack on the Philippines the soldiers who barricade themselves in a hotel in Manila, and demanded the failure of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, he has told reporters at the hotel our leader, Di Trillanes, who has accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to that, the village was attacked by a government-based soldier who used to use gas to use it.

On Friday, the government critics called for a strong protest against the president.
His government is under the influence of corruption charges for several months.
The financial district of Manila was the main scene of the campaign against Arroyo, organized by 200 members of the army on the Round in 2003.
The uprising was destroyed almost 24 hours early when the army refused to join.
At least seven coup attempts have been carried out since 1986 against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
The U.S. Square will be a big part of the Versatel.
