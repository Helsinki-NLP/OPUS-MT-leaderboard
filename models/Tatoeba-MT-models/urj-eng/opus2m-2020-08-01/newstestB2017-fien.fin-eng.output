A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a Sanfranciscoscola shopping mall in Sanfranciscola.
A recently modified 28-year-old cook in San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of the local shopping centre this week.
The brother of the victim says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had never made it right."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as Sanfranciscolaise Frank Galicia, 28 years old, reports to the San Francisco Legal Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Paris, had worked as a master at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small, close team, like a family.
"Our ideas are with Frank's family and his friends."
Mr. Louisicia tells us that Frank first lived in the hostels, but he had not been able to get his hands on it.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," he told Louis Galicia KGO Station.
Galicia says she didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
The way he and his family used to be together was to cook food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never used to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who passed through the stream.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an unwrought diamond that cast a spell every day", he says.
In all cases, any information is requested to call San Francisco Police Department’s tip number 415-575-44.
Young doctors working on the phone call for new measures to be taken to combat new work.
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are the main physicians in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission to engage in new fights in a new employment contract dispute.
The Committee of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Trade Union for Doctors (BMA) is requesting full support from the general government for further work as of early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA during the July vote.
58% of the members taking part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the president of the Committee of Directors, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to the members of the JDC on behalf of the Committee of Governors, saying that the government "quickly" on matters that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
It says: "In the light of this, the JDC Government has voted against a whole new draft agreement and demands that all our concerns be subject to new formal negotiations.
In response to the Government's silence, the government of the JDC has today submitted an official request to the BMA Government to request authorisation for a gradual extension of the fight against work since the beginning of September."
As a result of this dispute, junior doctors have already ceased to work for the past six times this year, which included the first complete work stops ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of Senior Doctors at BMA, resigned after the vote because she did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
Malawana said to BMA members that the agreement was good and should be approved, and 55,000 junior doctors and medical students participated in the vote.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the Agreement would enter into force and that it would concern doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: the Union of States?
It was a gesture that resolved the crisis.
On Tuesday, the Presidents of Turkey and Turkey held a war of expression and economic sanctions lasting eight months to reach a formal agreement and a formal decision.
However, when Vladimir Putin took over his Turkish staff in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I received a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was Ankara.
The parties did not agree with the agreement of the Parties.
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't get too hot even with his own sedentary death.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good-bye friend" Mr. Putin – according to a report five times.
I didn't stay in the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his zeal exactly the opposite.
However, the put-toothing permanent chill showed that the head of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at the time of the event was frenzy.
Putin attacked strictly, I said against Ankara and accused him of stabbeding him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an supposed friend.
Recovering true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to gain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the most controlled media in the country visited a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by the top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal trade in goods in areas within Isis's jurisdiction in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only so that Putin received the requested apology from President Erdogan.
This way, Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of recognizing a strong ceasefire are clear.
All in all, Erdogan needs all of his friends after he was almost abandoned last month in a failed coup d'état.
He has also been well shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in the Turks.
The agreement also has an economic impact on it.
The sanctions on origin have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter ban, since there are usually millions of Russian tourists travelling to the coast of Turkey each year.
The figure has collapsed by nearly 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be advocating the relief when air transport can finally be completed.
They put their faith in the late attack on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, the state television forecast for fruit and vegetables will fall once agricultural imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"The tourists, the tomatoes back here," was written in the Veemoston article.
The visit also had a greater positive value for Moscow.
The Akara is West, for it felt that the West had a reaction to the coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old resentment of the slow progress in Turkey's EU membership negotiations and the absence of Putin in the matter. Putin, which is eager to use the cool between the two and to break the Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support to the elected authorities after the coup d'état.
This was, of course, obvious to Moscow, who has its own troubled concerns about the change of power.
Therefore, at its summit in the brown seaport, Russia and Turkey could convey a picture that one analyst described as "the alliance of aliens": two countries that see themselves as being rejected by the West and, at the same time, treated together their forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between these two.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Tell you a lot that after nearly three years of initial negotiations, each president told you at the press conference that they had not discussed the subject at all.
The President of the President-in-Office of the Republic has deliberately refused to answer the question of differences between the countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could pursue consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the Member State of NATO by Turkey when shooting down the war machine, it is better that, after months of open hostilities, these two Heads of State are once again in talks.
Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland Banks are disappearing from their customers outside Scotland.
According to the Director-General of RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced by providing only business services, i.e. back office services, in the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to back down its goals when it would collapse eight years ago and was forced to escape.
During that time, brandists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors several pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations Rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it's been considered right for the first time to get to the top of the world's national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a discount for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be converted into NatWest, with the exception of the headquarters and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff at Inverness.
He said to the BBC Scotland: "RBB is turning into an investment brand and because of what our staff is working for, because we are now becoming much more and more different brand banks.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Today, our aim is no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations-rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the time to turn different brands into a bank, because basically it's about how we can make the bank a better customer," says the bank's CEO.
"It would have been very interesting three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced brands.
However, our work and concentration on customers' needs, instead of our own needs, has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettor was the producer of Predilection for victory at Newmarket and gain 3 000.
The dettor sprays champagne twice in a row in Newmarket, which would cost him 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3 000 profits at the UK Championships in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection one day to win the same night on the track of his own municipality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that will bring this milestone to a level playing field in competitions.
He has been reached before by Sir Gordon Richards, FF, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time master jockey Dettor, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are up because my family is here, too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a public of 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and I feel a great humility."
Dettor will welcome the raids with Predilection after his victory.
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the estuary competitions, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career more than 4300 times.
Lester Piggott, a nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins.
"Franke is one of the best jockeys of all time, and it is no surprise that he has just reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical privilege is the one that keeps him away from the rest of his life.
He is a fantastic representative of the rivalry, his enthusiasm and his dissident has brought support to the audience for many years."
"I told Franki a couple of years ago at Epsom that she would have already won 6,000 races if she hadn't competed only on weekends and in big competitions.
Seriously, Frankie's horseback riding course in the British Games has been a profitable nearly 30 years, which has been a great follow-up.
He is a living person, which is good for British rivalry, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori set himself up in a way that is unimaginably possible by jumping off his horse's back in a sleek way.
"From flying goals to a flight of entrants, Frankie Dettor has been an example of British rivalry for two decades.
There have been ups and downs on the road.
He has won a number of big competitions, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnifcent Seven", but he has also survived a flight accident and has been banned due to drug abuse.
When the competition clearance ended three years ago, he was having trouble starting up, but he showed an admirable nature of strength, showed his suspects and returned at best.
And he's not yet going to finish his career for a while – Dettor has recently said he wants to continue to make profits until he's at least 50."
Putin was separated by Manager Sergei Ivanov.
President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his administrative director Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted interior for many years.
Ivanov, 63, now appointed as Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the information provided by the Kremli, President Putin " decided to release Ivanov as head of the Presidential Board of Presidents", but no grounds for dismissal were given.
Mr Anton Vaino, who has been acting as Vice-Chairman for Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to this post.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
In the year 1972, Vaino, born in Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's Office and the Government's Office, reports the Russian-language website of the Kremlin.
The anxiety thanked Putin for his name, saying, "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the main role of the administration is to support your action as Head of State, which means making draft laws and controlling how your instructions are implemented."
Putin said to the new media company on Friday that Ivanov himself had made a divorce and recommended that persecution be followed by him.
Are you happy with the real ones?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he has a history of KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, each of them, at the State's public press conference, said Ivanov would withdraw from his mission on his own behalf.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, the explanations assure only a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are you excited about some kind of power struggle?
You still don't know that.
There has been a very suspicious official argument in Russia that a man, who has been praised as a potential president, wants to suddenly lead to Russian environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, difficult task for four years.
I have now served as President of the Board of Directors for six years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
First of all, he was the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB in the civil security service.
When Putin was the head of the FSB of the newly replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) of KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin stepped into power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov might become the Russian President after the second season of President Putin, since the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another part of Putin's neighborhood, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The Star of Criminal Minds - FBI Researchers - series, Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, said they were excited in their joint information.
Mr Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had issued an apology on Thursday before he was informed of his dismissal.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened", he keeps informing me of his information.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, in the press release of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies.
Earlier in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, a 54-year-old Gibson, has been part of a series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I have put my soul and soul in it for the last 12 years," says Gibson in his release on Friday.
"I promised that I would see the end of the series, but that is no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the authors, producers, actors, our great production group and most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for."
The production period of the 12th series will start on the 28th of September in the United States.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian garden is the mysterious beaching of fish.
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has requested assistance in identifying the fish found in his garden.
Bai suspects that these 75 fish are reefs that have landed on the ground under a whirlwind of storms.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, saw visible image material in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-foot fish.
Fife has now been linked from the overpass of #sferry to Fife.
A price of £ 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have joined the northeast side of the Queensferry bridge and the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "cassettes" which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
Siltaus Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 volleys of steel.
A price of £ 1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Mr Keith Brown, Minister of the Economy Department, visited the country today and was one of the first to land on the bridge.
He says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the overpass bridge at Queensferry.
We are all very important progress from the construction of the bridge, and more than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this section of bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge bridge, building is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
It is now close to 79% of the total volume, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to raise even further."
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions, says: "Preparation of the first bridge section is always an important milestone for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water industries.
After the last part of the road had been fixed and attached to the North Tower column's diploma, we had to close the remaining northern hole (i.e. the earth) after that.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the northern land bridge.
This was a massive and simultaneously highly accurate operation.
Massive because the ground bridge has a length of 222 metres and a weight of approximately 6 000 tonnes and was to be pulled up at a slope of approximately 3%.
And highly accurate because the tolerances that were to be followed by the working team were very small – only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports on the miracle of three men.
Anglesey was removed from his fishing boat from the water for three men who were saved like a miracle in trade.
The Moelfre RNI seafaring station made an alarm at 1:20 a.m. on Friday, during a local time in the Moelfre Bay Bay of Moelfre’s crew detected accident.
The three men deliberately tried to swim in safety while their boat continued its reckless journey to the air pilot.
"We saw a boat spinning right next to them and thought it was the worst," says Vince Jones, driving the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, luckily, the wind had taken the boat far away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the second one, at the age of 60, was found stifled in a tailing boat and without a life jacket.
All of them were taken on board a rescue ship and transported to the rescue station.
Vince says: "It is a wonder that these three men who have been caught up in water are still alive and perfectly well.
There was an emergency extinguisher on the boat’s engine, but for some reason it was removed from the man on the boat during the crash.
They really had luck on their way."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness.
It is fascinating to follow how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have chosen why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but will be left inside looking at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people on the couch and on the ground.
The original time of the screen was only taken by watching TV, then by video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is amazing to note that the technology and the outside movement do not exclude each other.
Here, I am referring to the "Pokémon Go" wildly. Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (and later also a drawing series, card cards and other ancillary products).
Like many popular cultural events, this also dropped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanseering in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
Only a few days ago, the user number of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as high as what it knew.
Then how does the game work?
In a brief explanation, players are going out to look for pokémoons with their mobile phones that are monitored by GPS. When you find a pokémo, it can be "photo" or "catalyst" when you find a pokémo.
It's been a bit of a jigsaw jigsaw with it, playing video games like a younger gamer, bringing up the backs on the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the amount that the "moderate" takes per day.
The Washington Post reported recently, an Apple Watch Intel Cardgram app that found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day increased from 45% to 53%, followed by 35,000 users.
The owner does not know who of the users plays the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data for physical activity quantities.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to climb the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have been echoing to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of sport should not be ignored.
There is a reduced likelihood of a regular mobile disease of cancer or depression.
Exercise helps weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The subtlety of the Poméon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
In doing so, it achieves three fundamental elements of health: exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to have even new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this environment also includes admirable joymakers.
Oh, yeah, someone might be afraid to walk down the door.
What about it?
The breakthrough is complete.
While cell phones like Fitbit may have been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow any reason to start acting like Pokémon Go does.
The freshness of freshness disappears, and consumption decreases in time.
However, the success of the Pokémons will lead to more games that combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the exercise of people who leave the hunt and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in the diversity of women's teleworking.
Pressure pressure.
Forget the hypnotic.
Simone Biles is an immune response to all of this.
Dynasty jumps.
I don't care what you do.
The jaws are shaking on the permoon.
Everything's great.
And now he's finally also an Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old Teneworker won on Thursday the Master of Diversity and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lights.
The overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the "Final Five" teammate on silver, Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze mythist Aliya Blackfin.
The United States Simone Biles will be present at the final on Thursday’s summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, U.S.A.
The party became the fourth consecutive and fifth American of all times, who won the title of the multiformity, thus strengthening his reputation as his generation’s best or even best of all time.
Bales sprung in tears when his final centers came to light and his long path to this moment ended.
Sailing takes a species to new dimensions and brings him to the same category of sports with other stars such as Michael Pups:
The Biles has been completely overwhelming for the past three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and accurate programs that the 19th Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton, Mary Lou Retton, called him "the greatest teleworker of all ages."
In the future, there was still one last competition between Biles and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to the River is less than a handful of gold medals would be considered a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver in the final Thursday at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, U.S.A. on Thursday, 11 August 2016.
Biles won the first biggest prize on Tuesday as a point on point i above the ground team, coordinated and now retired for Martha Karoly's visit.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything before when it was long at the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto programme — which includes a series of volts known as his card — has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents had already adopted their parents and found the mother of Coach Aimee Boorman, they have become a strong figure. Boorman found him while he was on a day-care trip to a gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-competition since summer 2013, and the profit and loss market will continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two tours, it was like a mirage.
There was still a boom and a perm in which Biles is a defender of the world's world.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points from the boom and turned the end result at 15.933 points from the permanent.
Raisman gently held him waiting for the final points — which was just a truth — and tears began to appear around the colour of the drawing of Biles, red, white and blue, once his dream of writing his copy of the book came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revision to the competition four years ago, when he first split the third place but then lost the bronze to the Black Cup in the new round.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader called "mute" by the Americans was clearly above Blackfina.
After his aerial program, he sent a flight crew to the audience, thus becoming the winner of the victory position, which at times seemed uncertain.
With regard to Biles, this television show made earlier than 19 years of age now has a completely new meaning:
The police are telling three musics in a car for the victim of a serial killer who's been bugged by a car.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix for ten years, and the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports the police release on Thursday.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elisel's daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the streetside on 12 June.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the vehicle, where he shot eight shots with his handgun and then escaped in another car, which says in the press.
The suspect suspect that the third death was probably not a robbery because the attacker did not take the purses or the hearing of another adult victim was $2,900.
Officer of the police in Phoenix, Sergeant PS says the police are now investigating whether death is linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin American-occupied areas within four months.
"It is common for events that they have happened in residential areas in front of homes," told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s Black and White Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks relate to each other and that they do the same thing.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for injuries where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Elise's daughter Maleah died immediately at the location of destination.
The witness told the police that the Wednesday had often sat in the car listening to music.
The police also published a press release stating that only half an hour before the third death of the shot on the empty open van, and that the shooter is believed to be the same in either case.
The researchers found the shells and took the bullets from the car seat into the plate and from the engine space.
Mother of a six-year-old son with a microbial wall: "The things are getting better".
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
However, unlike most other age partners, Edmund has microcephaly or congenital minority due to the genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciud, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I would never make it out of this.
I can't handle this.
I did not commit to this.
Which is really not true - you are, of course, committed to it," he says.
The country and her again to Vincent was told that Edmund would never ever identify them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in hospital care.
"The first reaction was that I didn't think it would happen at all anymore," says Piccitoto.
Edmund is running with the help of a controller.
Edmund sat down and started to bone at the age of three, and he still doesn't talk.
He's slowing down on his own.
He walks naked and drives a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and love to sing.
Elizabeth presents the sign of Edmund's invention, which means "Sing to me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciút told the CBS News news.
However, it does not just mean the common sign language, but also includes the signs that Edmund owns.
There may be a variety of diseases behind the microbial wall: hereditary, such as in the case of Edmund, or infections of the virus during pregnancy, such as ashtrays or gypsum virus.
The symptoms and forecasts vary widely.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who have been ill with the zikavirus.
Piccito reminds me of the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
"I kept on: whatever happens to us,
"What if we don't."
She still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But there is hopeful advice in Picciuu for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Ziavirus.
"The things are getting better.
Things are usually going to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
The severe rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi.
The Governor of Louisiana announced this Friday because of the heavy rains of emergency and widespread floods.
According to the national weather services, several rivers of south-eastern Louisiana and south-west Mississippi flood over their asses and spread to a wide range as a result of heavy rainfalls.
President John Bel Edwards of Louisiana tells us that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Mr Mike Steele, editor of the National Security and Emergency Emergency Authority, tells the Agency that he is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele says that only the Tangipah county has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
At the very least, the flood warning will remain in force in most of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the air service, water may reach a further 76–27 mm.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning was issued on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River, close to Denham Springs, each of which in Louisiana is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Kroutmann, many houses on the banks of the rivers may have to flood under the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods at the bottom of the Ascension County pose a threat, as flooding rivers are evaporated to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi State border in Louisiana, had already risen from 9 a.m. on Friday at 9 p.m. to 9 p.m.
The rescue work continued in the Districts of Aki and Tekkinson in South-West Massis.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and sons were earlier this Friday near the Gloster among the saved.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, was quickly hit during the night.
He was warned by the other half of the village that he was near.
"We got up, and the water came in with a sitting table," says Hansford.
"It extends to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he himself and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only swimming knowledge of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large army-style trucks and taken them to a firehouse in Gloster, where they kept them safe on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that the floods are spreading rapidly as the heavy loads continue, and the authorities are already preparing an evacuation order.
He tells us from the information received from the administrator near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil is soaked strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities report that because of the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the inhabitants of the region of Tangibada were forced to leave their homes and schools had to be cancelled in five schools.
A member of the GCPD had told WWL of 200 homes under the flood of the CBS subsidiary of TV and radio.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has hit both of them.
The regional director, Robby Miller, reports that the authorities have defeated 72 people and seven pets who had remained in the floods.
Evacuated areas have been opened up for shelters in the cities of Amien and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat", he says.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipaha district, almost two and a half streets were put in place because of the flood, and residents were offered sand bags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and their businesses' premises.
"The first time we experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, member of the Government of Finland.
"This flood appears to be equivalent."
In Paris, the rains kept on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, the civil servant director of the Harrison County County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday there was a report of a house under a heavy flood, but there was no information at all on Friday.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods store, Keith Townson, has been living in the region of Atai for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen water before, and more rain all the time."
A number of bullets from six-year-old Maháj Brown who have received their bodies are coping with the Philadelphia shooting incident.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
Parents of a child told them that the boy on the CBS Philadelphia channel was Mahaj Nyw.
The grandparents believe that the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in the neck, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
He's in critical condition at the hospital, and he's had multiple surgeries.
The group will inform the media company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was beginning his first class at the local sub-level.
This was one of four people shot at in the city of Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old reported critical status and two others were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the broadcasters, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether or not one of the wounded men could have been a shooter.
Officers told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between a number of armed men.
The location of the event was full of assault weapon-like shells derived from various attack weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters in place, and they have been involved actively in the shooting," said Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi, of the Philadelphia Police Department, to the station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
The arrests have not been made, and they are told that the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second victim of the shooting in the city this week was a six-year-old girl whose hand hit her as she played in front of her home on Tuesday in the district of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is the name of the Olympic Team of Women’s Council of the Legislators, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympic since 19th, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laure "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team represents America as well.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female worker has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were stationed 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose up to be the surprise winner of the competitions, and the whole of America cheered up.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, and the surprising and masterly intellectual works programmes of the world.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the diversity of women's individual competition.
Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver by his teammate Aly Raisman.
The visions are at the top of the species, but the same doesn't appear to be the case with teleworking hours all over the world.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same track as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), since the next Olympic team of tental gymnasts will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year coach.
The reality is, however, that telework is a very expensive sport type and gymnastics practice mainly in private telecommunications euros operated by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, trips, presences, competition fees, hotel fees (teachers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the Euros facilities are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support operations.
The training of colleagues takes place in these groups, and this means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
The coach of Simone Biles, Aime Boorma and Laurie Hernández, have each trained the amateurs of the species since they started training.
We need to organise more affordable and accessible training for the many young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own creation foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered a choice or an affordable opportunity for more than 15,000 citizens (mostly black and Latin American) in the field, and some of these young people have been involved in national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown, Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality teleworking for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic Games.
Working hard to develop strength, prudence and body coordination and to teach hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start a tentacle, and that's great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girl power" you showed when you were able to win the Olympic gold and for motivating so many backgrounds of young girls to begin their way into a well-being, strong and successful young woman.
The doctors rejected the proposal from Jeremy Hunt and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers hoped for their determination to resolve the dispute on remuneration and working conditions by adopting a trade union with BMA, the medical professional of the renewed agreement, but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior physicians who voted against the proposal rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister for Health Hunt told us about plans to make an agreement compulsory and said that the British public health system (NHS) was "not on any country" and that all further delays were harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement involving changes in night and night work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Yesterday morning, the president of BMA's Junior Doctoral Committee, Ellen McCourt, issued an opinion saying, "Youth doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, and there is a particular fear that it will stimulate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It's only eight weeks after the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we have to move forward now, because time is up.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctantly, and sometimes, in no way at all.
Despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of April, the second strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception periods when nurses and consultants were asked to join the strike watch to support the strike doctor.
Ministers hoped that they would complete the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the employees of the trade union representing doctors in Britain.
The BMA trade union is seeking a better remuneration for 54,000 junior physicians who would be involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, appealed to junior doctors that they would not take up new strikes.
Multimer says, "Working activities achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at extremes and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances for patients, health care and their families.
For the last two months, we have had negotiations with the Junior Doctoral Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
The employees were hopeful that a continuous positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, further training from job breaks, training costs, recognition of the programme, leave-and-greed pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how seriously workers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May."
A daily payment of €2.40 may reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are available daily for around €2.40, when they recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of use.
Anti-hypnotics ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already being given 12 months after the heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
The NICE, which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and which assesses the implementation of new treatments, has instructed patients to use ticagrelor for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, the NICE, which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and assesses the implementation of new treatments, has instructed patients to give ticagrelor for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people are having a heart attack each year, one in one-quarter of whom has a relapse or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat in the blood vessels that produces plaques.
If the plaque cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot breaks out, it can be carried out with the circulation of blood and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher for people who have had a heart attack again.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, which is known as Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of the contiguouss.
Today’s NICE draft Guideline recommends that ticagrelor be given for a first 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a 60-mg reduction in dose and an additional three-year reduction in aspirin twice daily for a further three-year period.
Professor Carole Longson, NICE, says: "Although effective treatment methods to prevent disease progression and the development of symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack get a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
The fear of creation can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of man.
We have obtained evidence that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendations for the use of e-grelorium at a time will increase the choice of choice for thousands of people who will benefit from it."
Given the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the case of a risk of exposure, if used for more than three years, it is recommended that the use of the treatment method is not further recommended in the draft guidelines.
Due to a political right-wing climate, the voter in Muslim regions flourished.
The former Mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was disfellowshiped last year due to corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The political right-wing climate led to a wide range of oversight in Muslim communities, revealing today's government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, former government minister, was very critical of the police, election observers and city councils for keeping their eyes shut about "due to hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion".
According to Pickles, the former Minister of State for Regional Affairs and the current anti-corruption power figure, the alarming of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have allowed the formation of guard chains outside the polls in order to protect the frightened voters.
He proposes that voters should apply for an identity card in order to prove their identity at the time of voting.
At the moment, the voter should only state his or her name and address.
In addition, the report seeks to baptize fingers in an indelible black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Revelations should be more protected, says Sir Eric.
He insists that suppliers have access to government documents and that decisions taken by informal committees and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent self-government, but also to combat fraud and fraud of economic interests and their culture in public administration in general", he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote on the Tower Hamlet in Eastern London.
Last year's special election decreed that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman would be forced to resign due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman "falsely" the religious sense of his Muslim community and subdued his critics by accusing them of racism and Islam.
Rahman was said to be "the basis of his campaign" that it was the religious responsibility of every believer in Muslim to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or sincere in such a way that the person voted to pretend to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, the estimate of fraud was obtained from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election campaign in which senior members of the Muslim community were told that they had pressured people to vote for their choice of candidates.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for identification at the polling site.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, in particular in Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities."
"There was concern that... the institutions of the state had closed their eyes to such activities because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion "of the 'publicly correct' kind."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to allow the system to be tidy, including banning the handling of post-voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'absorbing' of votes.
The report currently under review by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks in connection with registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferences.
Consideration of the options in which voters would be required to submit an identity card before voting.
Pouring your fingers in an indelible black black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Regular checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a limit of three years for requests for automatic post-vote.
Prohibition from political activists on the handling of voice and voice mail envelopes submitted by completed mail.
The police have the right to set up guard chains around the places of residence.
The amendment of the law makes it easier to raise threats under the 1883 Act of Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Refusal of filming in polls.
Only English is allowed in polling places (except for Wales).
In order to ensure that staff are monitored by the rule that only one person can go to the polling station at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it to be "excellent" that no criminal charges were raised following the case of Mr. Hamlet.
"The election court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty of no suspicious suspicion and the threshold of criminal evidence was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "cross-checks" of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The last year's decision of the Court of Justice in the case of Tower Hamlet was a mess," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the owner of all the parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert image of some parties and the denial of it."
The equivalence of the Olympic cyclists with the Duchess and other doubles are hovering at the Olympic Olympics in Rio.
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were wildly eluded by the French cyclists Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is an amazing match with the Duchess of Cambridge.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic official is by no means the only athlete who fights for the title and who has an equal with a well-known person.
In the honor of the Rio competitions and all the familiar faces that are shining on our screens, the FEMIL compiled a list of all the Olympic Members, who are manifestly in odds with the Hollywood publishers.
Hunter and Wolf: The U.S. Men's Fleet Team, Brady Ellison (left) is a Lingu Leonardo DiCaprio from childhood onwards.
In addition to the Duchess of the Cycling Ways, many people have quoted in social media how an actor might be the best friend of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. Men's Fleet Team Brady Ellison caused a storm after pictures of him on the news, where he is looking at the star of the movie "Big of Wall Street" with an astounding surprise.
Ellison was aware of the sound of social media and noted that he had already heard from a child that he looked like DiCaprio.
"I don't see the same as you, except for the better or the mustaches," said Brady Hoffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the London competitions in 2012, the British short jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were threatened with the equalism, which is undoubtedly even more evident in these competitions.
Big-eyeed Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina has been known as the doubles of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
The remaining fins are South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia, who has been known for many years as Matthew Morrison from the Glee TV series.
This user says that Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor of the Inception film.
Correspondingly, it has long been quoted between Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who is emphatically highlighted by the high angles and lips of both sides.
A swimming silver medalist, Russia Yulia Efimova recalls actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and her light hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, "the absolute version of Joseph Gorgon's Leviticus".
These two iron women, the star Hope Solo (left) and the actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), the Dexter series, remind each other of their faces and faces.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw similarity.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the pair to be equal.
One of the translators expressed his unhappiness when "other people on the internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series really resemble each other with their faces and faces.
Many have also seen the similarity between Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's joy and the winner of gold, Gabby Douglas and Anna, the star of the film, Gabrielle Union in a wide variety of ways.
The Olympic commentator of the CBC asks for an apology for the Chinese swimmer's "dead as a pig".
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan instead of women's 4 x 200-metre free-to-air message, the CBC's direct Olympic Report viewers were shocked on Wednesday by the CBC's direct Olympic Report.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer's "disgusting smell" and "dead as a pig" race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphones were off when he started to crack his own opinions at the end of the finals of the women's 4 x 200 meters free-to-air message.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's reporting system, was heard as saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby, this little 14-year-old Chinese egg.
He was too excited, ran off fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimming the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds of Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim in China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Mafarlane said, "Did CBC's reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese lady died like a pig?
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
In the final of the women's 4 x 200 meter free-sleeve message, Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Byron MacDonald’s critical comments were quickly fulfilled, and many called for his resignation.
The twisters did not keep their words when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was to them.
Substitute Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wau #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC delegation, quickly apologized for Mr MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the bathing potion.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
Finally, the CBC had to regret more than 90 times the people who had Twitched in response to the comment.
Scott Russel, a commentary colleague, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other twitchers' comments which complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The broadcast company also quickly asked for a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for the fact that they were sent.
We immediately asked our viewers for forgiveness last night, and we also apologized for our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the bathing performance, not personally, but personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry about his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized to the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that I did not mean it to be personal.
"I would like to apologize for my comment that I gave last night after women's communication," said MacDonald at the CBC Olympic Mission.
"I was referring to the bathing operation, not to the person.
It is not to say that I meant nothing disgusting with my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, without blocking underwear in the middle of the trade, the woman who made the deal shocked customers.
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman was taken off in the middle of Primark to make up for underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing how he looked in his underwear, taking them off his foot and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued the tour and at last tried four pair of panties in a store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestonen Bouveree Place Centre is located in Primark, where she tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf.
The mother of two children who were in the store at the same time, Jean Davidson, tells me that after trying on underwear, a woman who knew her body was angry and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells me what happened: "Man was not true in his eyes.
She stood in the middle of a trade, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own trim and underwear and put them on.
He certainly did not do it to my attention, but did it with absolutely no shame.
Everyone was staring at her when she took off the underwear she tested, and I didn't see her like them because she put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided not to like anything, worked out and walked out.
He did not seem to care about the look – nor did I think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had created."
Davidson, 33-year-old living in Kent City, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and has not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the trade staff will endeavour to remove these claims from the sale after she left – which is right.
It would be a shame to take home the new underwear and notice that someone else has brought them up without having been washed afterwards", adds Davidson.
Primark's editor commented: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkeston movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been removed from sales."
In this way, you will defend yourself against an armed attack with the help of Krav Mage.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the mayor of the Krav Maga, New York, and asked for advice on how to get away with the gun from the offender or assaulter who was in a nearby distance.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the adversary, depending on whether the adversary approaches you for or against you.
If the attacker approaches backwards, first of all, you have to turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun so that it stays between your elbow and arm and hit the enemy in your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the adversary on the knee into the joint, and when he goes from the pain to the double, stab him in the face with a gun on the tip of his hand and back up with a gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab a weapon and turn it around so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the weapon off from the attacker's grip, back off and hold the gun targeted at the enemy.
Does that sound like a problem?
Watch Mizarach do it.
Remember, though, that you will be safest to get rid of the kicker by giving up your cash – unless you are the head of the Krav Mag.
Ian Wright, who makes the journey, licks Europe's western places.
The British world traveler put his resistance and Kacumis reflex into a hard trial by licking Europe's dirtier and more unpleasant places.
The Suffolic director and the author of mobile guides Ian Wright, 51, wanted to demonstrate the strength of his resistance by licking euro banknotes, hand-handling at Piccadilly Circus, a train’s toilet fluff and a public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a lumometer to see for himself and to show the viewers what language was pushing.
The test was conducted on the basis of a documentary Ian Wright – an insider’s strength, and its results surprised him.
The idea of licking the toilet shower in the train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On a journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals with the establishment and health of good bacteria in the intestine.
Fortunately, there was nothing he was touching that caused nothing but the mouth of a bad taste.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel programme, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Indeed, the licking of railway handrails and toilets will have challenged Wright's resistance.
"I've been rather careless about my health since I was a child and I've put everything in my mouth, like soil, worms and shit."
In the movie, he really showed himself to be real taxed.
The border only came up in a horrific public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For the sake of comparison, it should be noted that the number of hands that have been exposed is usually less than 60.
The border came up in a new general toilet where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured the value of 4000 units – in the exposed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright, together with Valio, is looking at the documentary film Ian Wright produced after the inner force, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
"This is the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4000 units! Nothing is dirtier than that!
The place has to be so disgusting that I'm not licking anything here."
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – after internal force, in cooperation with Choose.
By choosing Wright, he was given Valo Gefilus, which was a protein-enhanced and vitamin C and D-enriched, which helps to strengthen his intestine’s good resistance and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the category of selection of snacks, juices and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
What is fascinating about viewing and, at the same time, telling us about the benefits of probiotics?
We took a lot of time to make some crazy idea, and eventually we got the idea to ask Ia."
Salt health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a wider context rather than simply talking about products and to share the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the health of the intestine and how it is related to resistance.
Salt health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The film also shows our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items that we asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some of the objects, while some were rather bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows filmed on the tape."
During the selection in 2015, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially in the abdominal and intestinal well-being, and 58% reported that they had used at least once in the case of products with the addition of lactic bacteria.
Prior to its rejection, the families in the town of Saltashi, Cornwall, destroyed the city-owned rental in Saltash, Cornwall.
The families affected left 50 000 pounds of damage to the town-owned rental house after they had been released for the terror of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skello and her husband, Shaun Longcock, have been released from her apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following complaints against several couples.
When the couple were forced to leave the dwelling, the representatives of the rental company found the dwelling to be in repair housing as a shock.
There were huge openings in the walls, the floors had been torn off, the trash had been spread on the floor and the walls had been broken with graffiti.
The country has now moved, and they are believed to live in private homes.
Donna McEvoy, Head of the Cornwall Housing Agency of Cornwall, says she is afraid that she may no longer be able to save the dwelling.
He says, "This has been a complete nightmare for people who live here, who should not have to put up with this kind of thing.
There is a lot of weight to weigh, as the property is likely to become known as not as a very pleasant part of Cornwall.
He's insensitive, just like his name."
According to the police, the family's violence included street fights in baseball countries, intimidation of their neighbors, drug use and transmission, and loud screaming, quarreling and cursing.
Skeldon, 47-year-old, who signed the lease, received an order for non-social behavior in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the shower.
In the past, drugs had been sold from the house, and the floors had been torn off.
Neighbours say the family fought on the street and the police were sent to call the police regularly.
The Cornwall home office evicted a couple by force this week after giving them a further 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the proclamation – they said that their lives were in heaven on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and this whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it.
It's gonna be wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Head of the coercive officers of the Cornwall Housing Agency, tells us that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were invited regularly.
The trash and old toys had been thrown on a wild wall of the house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for himself and his family's conduct, as the decision is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing agency is considering.
This event was very difficult because it was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working party, the police officers of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the Community who took part in the work and offered them the courage to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give a message that non-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells us that three sons of the family had all lived in a dwelling at different times, but were already in twenty.
Found a dirty pillow in one of the houses after the wedding.
Housing workers now have to clean out the waste that surrounds the house.
The police made a raid in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and also scales and other items and 1 700 pounds of cash.
Skkeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of class B drugs for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed that the money was his son, who died in a car accident in 2013, for his son Lee Skkeldon's tombstone.
After being homeless, Skkeldon and his husband have been heard of moving to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The elements of many rooms had been mutilated with graffiti.
The police are calling for the withdrawal of tenants who violate the lease rules.
According to Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police, this wedding is a clear warning to tenants who keep threatening the rules.
"This is a clear signal for those who think that they can act as if they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with our partners in order to protect our communities.
Low-flighted, land-wreaked military jet scared tourists in Portugal.
Sun worshipers were living a shock in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft rushed into an astoundingly low ground.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The image shows the moment when tourists were forced into terror when a low-fly jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic picture shows how an army aircraft comes to close contact with a range of sun-taking tourists on a sandy beach in northern Portugal in Aveiro.
Holidayers rose on their feet with a clear concern about the engine’s engine’s jet engine, which began to hear before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of social media holidayers was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Argoja added: "I was surfing and I was sure that the machine would fall on me."
Tourists near Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly came to light and flew astoundingly low as possible.
The Portuguese Air Force informed us today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires had a negative impact on visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not undermine any safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the mainland-Portugal and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force informed us today that due to the poor visibility of the fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the first half of the year was better than expected.

Crime intelligence helps to investigate crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police authorities has been a unit for RTA or criminal intelligence and analysis.
The operation of the unit is outward viewless.
The Hämee Police Department comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a Sergeant Sergeant in the Bay.
The chairman of the discharges board is the Lieutenant in Lahti, Finland.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to the IT service in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a dormitory.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, considers Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides different reports to other police officers.
In an emergency, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Reform of fresher working methods
Setting up analysis units is a reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to ensure that the police are more and more likely to take off the whistles when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most necessary to do so.
A single criminal intelligence centre was set up with the reform of the local government, under three national units, and each police department with its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in the context of the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa is run nationally by the PTR Centre.
In PTR units, people from the police, customs and border guards work according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work according to the police departments in the divided areas and are responsible for providing information to both the local police and the national units.
Intelligence has the effect of outside the territory of the country.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own body, because that is what crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the Basic Police.
With the help of registers, alert database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or similar offences.
This is referred to as a series, and it is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools available.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is genuine or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain image is formed of the author.
The selection may be made either on the basis of the way in which it is made or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes.
RTA unit workers do not travel in the city with collars standing up, but their work is not fully public.
The use of methods not only by criminals but also by criminals is not reported, as this could result in professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police law enforcement efforts.
The police will publicly report on the conduct if they foresee a threat to them.
This case, for example, was updated from early summer, using the identification of empty dwellings used in housing breaches.
The authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a pin or a tape piece, in which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-testing material shall be made public at least to the interested parties.
The analysis unit has found that professional criminals are learning from mistakes they have made.
The nobility order the minutes of the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
The next time, we were stolen, leaving with gloves on our hands.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppä from Hämee Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information that enables the planning of practical activities.
Background to the reduction in labour and financial volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation shall collect information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined people was killed in Syria.
They say that one of the three British school students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee tells the family that Sultana died in Syrian Raqqa a few months ago.
He was thought to have been killed by a Russian air raid on Raqqa, the ISIS base in Syria, reported on Thursday of ITV News.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she's just planning a war-switching country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will in order to make people realize that this is a real risk when going to the war zone - and who makes people give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, together with two other Eastern school girls, went on a plane flying to Turkey and took a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married Isis in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says that Clinton's support for Garland's name will be the Supreme Court if he is elected.
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, president of the Democratic Federation, will appoint Merrick Garland as judge of the Supreme Court, if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's name after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to President-in-Office Mitch McConnell, the President-in-Office of the Council will choose the person to fill the seat of Judge Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court Supreme Court.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he would predict that Clinton would choose Garland's "work with great certainty".
The informant of the Reid later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether or not this was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "play the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S.C.C. in Columbia County Court of Appeal.
Reid says that the Republics that inhibit Garland's name are the presidential candidate Donald Trump's "muchs" and "premiers" of Donald Trump.
According to him, Trump is not in office.
According to the “Treats” magazine, low calendars are as common as men.
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Belle Sea and launches the 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirell for 2017.
Instead of public secret collections, they want to find the highest models of the next generation in their 2017 NU Mus calendar.
Treats's CEO, Steve Shaw, told me earlier this year that his magazine, which is giving rise to a discharge, differs from the old school's Playboy magazines, because according to him, "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he's thinking the same about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nuances, where women, wherever they are, can enjoy and inspire these images that praise the female body," says the press release on the issue of the Watch Tower Journal.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Models for calendars that can send images via the network or participate in open choices in Los Angeles and New York.
Fascinating styling: Who buys discs?
Single, middle-aged men like blobs.
Before you have time to write a comment on an angry objection with the name not all Single-aged Men, this argument is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, behind the re-emergence of well-spoken sheets, there is not a millennial generation boom when millennials want to feel the physical object in their hands, but instead the misty of the Middle Ages.
The age of the person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those of age 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just a hobby's desire to catch discs, but it is of sentimental significance: it is likely that the older buyer of vinyl discs will keep their feelings hidden (56%) and enjoy being alone (69 % v. 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a television news broadcast, the camera would follow me walking along the lively Soho Street, wearing an undecorated gray jacket, and I was thinking, I'd fold my hand into a cup and say something about tradition, like, "Let's see."
So let's be clear.
Although Soho has probably lost its charm and its wealth when the hotels, the Ats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a lot of specialty shops left to do.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I come very close to visiting men in these stores and try to assess their age and character by looking at their nature.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55 followed by Sister Ray (at present by two young women, three middle-aged men), a Reckless Records movement (at present eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is attending a meeting in London this afternoon and spending extra time studying the supply of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
"I have about 3000-400 discs."
These plates will fill his living room image, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart sent a picture to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly his available income, and he is now able to buy some albums that he could not afford when they first appeared, and buy back things that he had to sell when he was young and without money.
"I'm getting a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early 70s that happened when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl plates are probably introverts who enjoy themselves and adds: "I don't smoke, I don't drink much.
It's bad."
Wez, 25, who works at the Master Ray, also believes that many of their clients are compatible with the YouGov profile.
However, he has seen a new human flow that has been affected by media hypnotism, and these people have heard about the re-entry of the vinyl plates and are now forced to buy back their old records.
"As a result of the discussions I had taken place, people had usually given up their collections in 1998 or 1999 at around the same time.
Customers who sold their gadgets to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gadgets back," he says.
This can explain the boom of any kind of vinyl-surveillary.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the audio discs?
In just a few seconds, you realize, in a movement like Phonica, that they offer comfort to community-like types of people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset with the non-personal payment system.
The digital world may fool some of the vinyl fans, whose return to familiar discs means stability and reminds young people of happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills up a hole or acquires tangible property as some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I think so too, many others.
It's an easy way to get ideas elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" swept up by Wez's co-worker behind the recording.
The ICM opinion survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the 98 album last month had not yet been listened to the album.
The opinion also found that 41% of the players who never use a record player and 7% of the buyers of the vinyl disc have no own record player at all.
At this point in time, I would probably look like a serious face, while at the same time, I would like to see a stack of nova collections.
There is also a "pocalyptic phenomenon" associated with the re-entry of printed sheets, which has been observed by Jonny, 42, the supplier of Sounds of the Universe (at present three middle-aged men as a customer).
"A new customer came into circulation and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it in his shelf," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not high, but they are nevertheless.
For them, the subject matter is more important than music.
Some of our customers are telling us that you don't have a disc player yet.
They are younger, no older, largely teenagers, who are just beginning a hobby."
The customer community is much better at Foppi, where I will come next. The movement has dedicated a whole floor to the vinyl plates.
The customers include 70-year-old couples, photonic tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers makes a difference, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of sounding the rushing jazz, the newest sex-related synthesizer pop by Wild Bests.
No customers seem to be very lonely, but it is difficult to see a dilapidating psychological trauma standing by someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and looking at various discount discs.
He's more of a watcher than doing shopping.
He tells us that his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
The music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the taste of the whisker is ...", he lets go of the glamorous stroke and goes on to:
"I can't understand, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they'd be advocating jeans, but who, instead, gather around the Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and daughter who are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a stairs filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key plates for any equal collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just an interior element and part so high they won't even be reached.
They're pure "art Vinyl" related.
However, given that all means of getting attention to these discs may require more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho search for Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population, which is most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxuryes, such as vinyl discs.
Although the results of YouGov are true, especially in Soho’s record shops, although based on my research, they do not exclude a large number of women collectors and vinyl fans, which are actually present in both stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won't spend their Thursday mornings in Berwick Street’s record shop, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old TV drinker who stares scaryly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker’s live ice is the longest living vertebrate – video report.
According to researchers, the world's longest living vertebrate is frozen.
According to medical investigator Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice-cream in the study was studied between 272 and 12 years old; it was a length of five metres.
The Court of Justice dismissed an application for the decommissioning of the weekend camp shops.
The French court has rejected the application from the Calais authorities requesting the deportation of tens of temporary shops and restaurants with thousands of refugees in the jungle camps.
At the trial this week, the Calais authorities submitted arguments that the State should not be allowed to break up the 72 temporary trade established for the refugee camp. Trades sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks and provide haircuts. Temporary restaurants can buy 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais's predecessors, these shops and restaurants must be decommissioned because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
The humanitarian groups informed the Court that trade and restaurants were necessary for the camp, as the free meals offered by the State-supported organisation and other parties are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, ad hoc shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food for those who need it.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legitimate ground for deportation of 72 ad hoc traders, but considered Calais' prefect to be "fully understandable" to be concerned by Calais' prefect.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp have far greater meaning than simply providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
They say they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the landing was the camp Jungle Book Kids, which is non-profitable and offers 200 times a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors in the camp, whose position is the most vulnerable.
Over 170,000 people have signed an address where a child’s café is required to be maintained.
According to a letter sent to the Guardians, its closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on the eve that the population of the weekend camp has risen to more than 9 000 people in record life since the sharp growth of summer's arrivals.
The price of food in Finland is falling more often than in the EU on average in Finland.
Food is becoming extremely cheap in Finland to the pleasure of consumers and to the trouble of producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years, while in the EU countries their prices have fallen by VAT per cent on average.
At the same time in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices in Finland have fallen to two most in the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In Britain alone, the price of food has fallen more than in Finland.
The information is presented in the publication of Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen's article published in the Data & Trends blog.
Entrepreneur compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data will be from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013 prices fluctuated close to 1994 price levels.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the Russian import bans on food, imposed at the price by Russia, which have failed to export food from Finland to Russia, are being lifted.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
"Putin's policy has helped a Finnish consumer with a short-term goal," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
For the consumer, the competition has been seen as a display of promotional campaigns.
Finland is still not a source of favourable food, even though the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with a level of pay similar to that in Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant effect on value added tax.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same percentage of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from the countries with the same wage level.
Lehinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would be more affordable food than the Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries at the price of food, we need to halve the VAT on the average of the EU countries and continue the price competition", Lehtän writes.
Note that the percentage of VAT calculated by him is indicative.
The school is no longer exactly the same as it is.
If you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic period in all primary schools, has been developed.
It is a guide that every school in Finland operates.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a journal is abandoned, and, on the other hand, the school is starting to practice coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education begins at the fourth level.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school visits more interesting.
The life of the most long-last long-last long backs he was found - the ice ice cold may live up to 400 years of life, up to 400 years, and up to 400 years of life.
Yähikanin’s well-known Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest long-lasting vertebrate in the world.
In the natural world, it is only passed by an Icelandic shrub whose oldest known individual has been scheduled for 507 years.
Landland sharks travel all the way to the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs longer, they can grow to over five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, the follow-up indicates that only about a centimeter a year, the adult individuals have lived for a long time.
For how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University, together with his colleagues, found out.
He determined the age of adult ice-creams from the 28 females that had remained in fishermen's fishing gears.
The age of fish was revealed by radio-carbonisation of eye lenses.
The average duration of the search was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
As it has been found in previous studies that the ice-hainars are less than four metres old, researchers calculated that at that time they were about 150 years old.
The publication of this study was published in The Science.
Emissions from Stocking to almost 300 - sellers are not to be deducted from the deduction of salesmen.
Almost 300 employees are hired from Stockmann, a freight company.
The Joint Undertakings in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the awards, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take place in the form of layoffs," Stockmann explains in his information.
According to it, the number of traders in the trades will not be reduced to ensure that the customer service is not profitable.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The YT negotiations in Stockmann concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the reduction need was estimated to be around 380 workers.
This reduction is intended to target annual savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties in Stockmann’s ability to make goods trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, trade in goods still makes losses.
According to Stockmann’s CEO, Lauri Vejalainen, sales in the trade sectors have not achieved the objectives set by the company.
"The reduction in human resources is, unfortunately, necessary to ensure the positive result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", says Veijalainen in the bulletin.
The result of the second quarter was particularly driven by the good success of Lindex in the food chain.
The Ketju achieved the net sales and profits of the best second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating profit of the Stockmann Group was 4,1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will fall last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure centre in the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday, reports H's meteorologist Ilona Ling.
There will also be rainfalls in the central parts of the country, but it is pouring south.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rain areas, 10-15 degrees remain in the north.
Kena's public sports team is shaking the dopingsandal coach's speeding a strange explanation.
Austrian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Olympics in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The press agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to appear is a 800-meter star of the Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arah, a member of the national team leader of Kenya, told us that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a demonstration of Rotichina in the surprise test.
The Doping Officers came to the authorities of Anzra to report to the authorities of Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because "he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour", the president of the Kenia Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on behalf of the news office Reuters.
Olympics' public sports begins on Friday, and Rothini is scheduled to run right at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the event.
Rotich was ranked fourth last year in the World Cup on the fourth and is an ex ante match for the winner of RA.
According to Reuters, the source in Kenya's public sports team claimed that Anzrah went on an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," he said.
Who is everyone?
An empty numeral of a public sports platform in Rio is an important part of its empty space.
Where is everyone?
At least at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, they will not be watching public sport at the Olympic Stadium.
On Rio, a Friday’s struggle was started on public sports medals, but the world’s top ideas were able to demonstrate their skills to an unsuspecting naked view.
On the Friday, the Ži organisations reported that only 58% of the first day’s morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago, in London, where the stadium was pulsing from a cheering crowd.
The finals' flags are already sold out in the country.
Even before public sport, the loss of the Olympic Olympics has attracted attention to the loss of viewers already before the Olympic Olympics.
For example, thousands of empty parks have been seen in Rugby, Melon and Horse Viewings, for example.
When Brazil’s medalheads Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach volleyball in the original Copacabana, only 70% of the scene was full.
After the other two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 views were full.
At least the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far removed from European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the used Brazilians.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have been flushed to a football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the facilitator, told us this weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said according to Reuters.
8.2 million of the 8 000 London Olympic flags were sold even though the flags cost nearly half as much as the Ostrobothnia flags.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for openings.
Over half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16 per ticket.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers are in need of money and are trying to get tickets to the market until the last minute.
True, operators have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were empty places at the Rio Stadium this afternoon.
Even a beach volleyball in the Copacaba sand has no interest in the audience.
Jukka Kessalo was competing in London in 2012.
People's magazines have had enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation will participate in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically important natural areas of ownership.
After that, private, corporate and community entities can redeem the right to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area has been distributed in a virtual way into blocks that those willing to purchase for payment of the right of right.
The administrator receives the right of veto in a section of 187 square sizes, which in practice means that each holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is intended to be changed.
Administration rights can also be acquired in more than one cell.
The acquisition of jurisdiction is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go carrying banners or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature", Juha Levikov, who acquired control, explains why.
The contracting authority will receive precise location information from its department, which will allow for example a visit to the block.
The names of the rightholders on the Foundation’s website, which appear on the Foundation’s website, shall appear on the same map as the country’s parcel data.
Leväht sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only if the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and the environment.
The reason is that the Foundation would act in some unethical or commercial way, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Manager project is the protection of habitats so that they can remain intact and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to re-integrate from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves torture large cities most of all Thupu - see the situation in your home.
Cyclists torture Finland’s large cities, the worst of all, in the world of Turku by cyclists.
This year there has been stolen from the population in proportion to the number of inhabitants more round than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the cyclists reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts thereof stolen in the ten largest cities this year in January to August per thousand inhabitants has been determined.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two cyclists per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
There's a big difference.
“In other cities there are double thefts relative to the number of people living in other cities,” explains Tommi Reen, Inspector of the Police Board of Finland.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than in other countries.
I have no answer to that.
"The general public may be affected by how much the city moves around and how many wheels there are at all", says Sergeant Teemuäs.
Tommi Reen, the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise relatively high.
The amount of bicycle theft goes largely depending on the cities of study and trading.
The market has a central center, short distances and plenty of round supply for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a very different city, where urban centres are far away from each other and bicycles are not necessarily a primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police information has become a little less about bicycle theft in January to August than in the same period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite years of decline, the police will be informed of just over 20,000 cyclists a year.
This means 50-60 fibrils every day and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 people per year.
"They're huge amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to make a crime report on cyclists, even if it is less recent than any 10th of the police reported to the police.
Typically cleared bicycle theft is where the police receive information about the theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There are also cases in other investigations where, for example, a drug case apartment may have stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists will be caught weekly in connection with their own work or police investigation, says MD Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen from, for example, the bicycles, interiors, warehouses and bicycles of the shopping mall, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual wheel models, the most stolen are the previous years' way of doing Things.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
For example, some people take a loop for their own use, but most of the stolen circuits end up sold online, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't been known to the police that there's a lot of stolen balls going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the shoppers of stolen wheels are common Finns.
I'm sure you can buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
A used-up buyer must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hiding offence or infringement.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a good spin is sold to the bottom of the clear", Reen says.
Severi Härvi, the publisher of the library, bears the colour Nopsa for his working day in Helsinki for the protection of the library of Kallio for the duration of his working day.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, the monster says. "There's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves so much, this may not be a hipster value," the Helsinki Horrible wonders.
Siuri Valve, who quickly visited the Kyosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel threw a kisosk against the wall, but in general, Valve is locking his bike on something tight, like a bike.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing to own," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone spent about five hundred euros.
"How long does it take to hear from your friends that you've been taken away."
"Mostly bad wheels, such dirty boys."
A bicycle was stolen from the control of the company's inner yard a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been compromised, Valve could expect it to be stolen.
Under the age of 15 responsible for his crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with a peer review team known from the United States of America.
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in a crime cycle.
The initial experiment is applicable to persons under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer review team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer panel will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer panel in order to justify what he did.
For example, the other consequences may be a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Latio, the youth director, tells us that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
"All young people are led in a more responsible way so that they do not get involved in the first mistake," Latio says.
A model of the United States of America, where it is widely used, has been taken on board by the peer review team.
The idea is that the young person, after his first murder, will not face the adult panel, but will reflect on what has happened with those of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service author of Palmu, who followed the trial, Ilkka Lovio, says that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first cases of persons under 15 years of age may not have been discussed before.
"It's been a message to keep up your choice on the road," says Lovio.
The peer review team is part of the Helsinki Project for Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me Foundation.
It stresses that new policies are offered to all people who need them, not just to the immigrant youth.
Over 70 Republicanists want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign.
Over 70 Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to cease funding the Presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The book was reported by the United States newspaper Politico, who had received a draft for that purpose.
According to the magazine, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Committee of Republics of the Republics, Reince Priebus.
The authors would like the Party's money to be channelled to the Congress elections instead of the Olympic campaign.
"We believe that the differences created by Donald Trump and his disregard, inquence and record disadvantages threaten to bring these in elections to the Democrats a sound circuit," says Politico.
The direct trend in all possible assets towards the Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in the Trump-decorated anchor at their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since the chances of winning the Presidential election will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent over next week.
Among those who have signed are politicians such as Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organised persons in the letter is obviously the Republic of Andrew Weinstein, the Republic of the People's Republic against the Truming.
According to the politician, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority of the people in the United States" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working in the field of national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton's permission to provide relief for families with children in the United States of America.
In the United States, President-in-Office of the United States, Hillary Clinton, United States, told of the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to make sure that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy is doing well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
The Clinton plan is focused on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure, roads, bridges and airports.
This would be the case in the case of the various increases in taxes, in the case of private money.
The construction programme is a hand allocation for the American southern edges that suffer from the shift of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme a major investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the people of the art, we must go back to construction.
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children working in the workplace.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders when he pointed out that the real people should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States for tax liability, it has to pay the tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he supported before it.
"As President, I object to any trade agreement that operates against employees or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculations published prior to Clinton’s speech, the newspaper The Newspaper said that Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it would “only favour millionaires of this kind”.
With more than any bid, Clinton has previously called the "Trump loophole" a reduction in company tax.
Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small enterprise.
He reminded the hearers of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has not paid and of the items Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton pointed out.
These are Rio's viewers: Cats have not glued Finns to the screens, but mobile applications are interesting.
Usually sports competitions are seen in TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached a lot of ratings.
At one time, competitions have glued at the top of the squares 12% of the population: on Tuesday night the swim was followed by 615 000 viewers from the High Olympics TV2 at the same time.
For the sake of comparison: six-monthly public sports EM competitions received nearly 800,000 viewers each time over TV2, and the football EM competitions received a fair second million.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in the Sunday night’s biking and the fiveth day of the competition, which both reached the Olympics at a time with nearly half a million viewers.
The Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that viewers are divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns will be following the Olympic Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers in general choose the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Olympics in Rio are the first sports competitions that Yle has owned the entire channel.
When a broadcast arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, that is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in 2012 in London or 2008 in Beijing, but the difference is explained in part by the time difference - a large proportion of Ž’s broadcasts come to Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for the lack of interest - if someone now thinks it's a thin one - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprises of the initials, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport in general is only beginning, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been, according to Pokki, close to what was expected.
When public sport begins, viewers will explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which was launched on the first days of the competitions at Apple App Store for the most downloaded applications in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150 000 times.
I guess we're already heading for 200,000 downloads.
"We're gonna get the numbers of the online viewers later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users as intended.
Positive says that feedback has been received and errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena’s use has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Applications have produced up-to-date versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will be more visible on the Yle channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can be used to track some species, and Yle Talks can be broadcast on the Yle Fem network every day.
Olympics are not only the most working for the Yle but also the last ones that can be followed only by the Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be featured both on the Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deep lake?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is the Päijä, whose depth is 95,3 metres on the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technical research coach Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre cut from the crossside, the bottom depth of which was found in 104 meters by the diving machine.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to confirm its observation by means of a so-called so-called ‘externalisation’.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, therefore, the official depth is still 95,3 meters.
The deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvee (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Peajärvi.
They haven't been studied as well as on Sunshine.
The bottom of Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown deeps from there," Kannella wondered.
If the deep lake is determined by means of a central depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, your Sunshine will not get into the ten deepest groups and Suvasvei will still be at a distance from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Revised last paragraph, where the most deep lakes in central depth were wrong.
A beautiful tax field: Pensioners' tax continues to be tighter than that of the tax on pensioners.
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that there was a misfortune under parliamentary elections and that it was promised equal taxation of pensioners against employees.
This is not the case in the Government's draft.
We think that that would definitely be the case.
The promised promises should be continued after the election, he will tell the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received a reduction in their earnings, which reduced taxation.
The matter warmed up the opposition's representatives in the Parliament, who shuffled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbi (Kok.) for the election promises.
The purchasing power will be secured, it will not grow.
In the line presented by the Minister of Finance, Petter Orpon (Kok.), Ihalainen believes that the main issue of tax reductions is to safeguard purchasing power and not increase purchasing power, as next year no increase will be made.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Orpo with the intention of respecting the Treaty of Accession, which has been reached with great pain.
He says that it is crediblely important to respect this agreement..
It is the main economic and employment policy of the periodical period.
It has been made with the powers of the industry, so it should not be called into question.
This will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and for people to believe in their own future.
Long-term unemployment in the catchy turn of long-term unemployment.
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth, in a budget line.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17 000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims of attacks in Thailand.
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy invites Finnish people in the country to be alert, to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish civil servants working in Thailand should not withdraw their travel due to explosions, but should be advised to follow the instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in the suburbs are very few in the suburbs.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their precise number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel by Finns in Thailand is scheduled for an annual period of time.
Most Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in particular in Hua Hin, in order to get information on the local situation.
However, several of our contact persons at Hua Hin are gone at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No known reason for its development.
According to Westphalen, there is not yet any information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political restlessness of the Thai society and to last week's referendum on the constitution of the military junta.
The Act was adopted by a vote.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests for people who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to add to the right of self-regulation.
However, since then, the attacks have not been extended to tourist sites.
It's a big, local day in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and the Mother's Day.
Transport in the city is very small.
The effect of the attacks on the day is that the authorities are very precise in terms of security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, says the Thai police according to AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the last 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the favourite tourist destination in Finland, the holiday island in Phuket exploded at night by four bombs, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current data show that they did not demand death victims.
Two bombers from the bombs according to a magazine in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to the local authorities, in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both of them in South Thailand in the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is a way to go to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, director of the controlled military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Tai BSB that the purpose of the targets was to destroy the country's trade because all attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish people who are going to Thailand should not withdraw their journey due to explosions, but it is wise to follow unwarranted guidance from a precautionary point of view, says Westphalen.
In the case of Europeans who are affected, the Europeans are in a position to act as Europeans.
Very little is known about the attacks during the summer night and their victims.
About last night's attack in Hua Hin, a little more information has been needed about Hua Hin.
The local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least among the wounded are Germans, Italians, Dutchs and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the well-known watch tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from an area where it believes it will find another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bench, according to the governor of the county.
In the event of an attack, a municipal worker was killed.
There is at least one case of infectiveness.
The chief of police interviewed by the CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded approximately half an hour ago.
According to Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple.
The United States of America Raisman was the second point on 6 March 1998 and the Russian Subja Blackfina was the third with 58,665 points in performance.
Biles, 18, still aims for telemetry in Rio's competitions on perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnastics in the past few years to a large extent.
For three of his previous years, eight personal world betrotheds from each of the previous three years.
He has won three consecutively and in the last year and the second year of the year in the fourth round and permancan titles.
The United States team in Biles has achieved two team competitions worldwide.
Shorter MM medals The Biles have a jump and a fag.
Taiwanese civil servant: "The father has no influence on tourism".
Esa Huvila, who runs the real estate agency in Phuket and the children’s playground in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the attacks on the audience in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think it's going to be any more amazing, but as a Finnish business company in Asia, the Huvila, who worked for some twelve decades, will assess the Finnish company Huvila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thailand's trials of tragedy.
There's always something.
At first there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these formers have not deported the tursts, then no one will.
The hospital’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
The lobby heard a blow from its own staff.
The employee called about nine local hours and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huvila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local staff arrived at the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblock had been set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the anniversary in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open about 10 o'clock local time.
Many people on the beach had never even heard of attacks.
Half-thirty days at the Thai time in Patong, traffic was normalized and much of the trades had opened its doors.
On the basis of the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site of the attack.
Later that car was seen at the Jouxholmini in Kruunjusk.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men matching the signs hiding in the nearest six.
Another man was caught immediately.
The other one escaped, but the man was later found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and committing gross damage to motor vehicles.
The D.O.C. thanks those who have given me the tips.
Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Foreign Affairs and Development:
On Friday, high-ranking leaders were made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration from Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old, Estonian-based Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that Ivanov's dismissal may be due to Putin's desire to prevent strong people from taking too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of executive functions is one way of controlling power.
This is a way of preventing people from asking the President to exercise independent power for themselves.
According to the Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in contact with other directors or has failed.
Armour drop to Ivanov.
Ivanov, a member of the inner circle of Putin, is going to be assigned tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for the transfer of duties and proposed a replacement of persecution, said Russia Today.
The fabric purro says that Ivanov's view is a clear fall in position.
In Russia, environmental and transport affairs are not very high in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era at the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynönniemi from the Institute of Foreign Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's site is that Putin is going to change his neighbour to a higher place.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human factor when they withdrew from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, the Arab and Kurdish fighters gained around 90% of the important city of Manbij for their people.
It is estimated that ten jihadists remained in town at that time.
Revised news at 7:30 p.m.: In the past, we were wrongly told that civilians were on the run from the city, in fact, Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while they fled from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s Documentary Directorate is unlawful.
The Ministry of Interior’s orientation on public disclosure is unlawful, says Tomi Virutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland, Professor of Public Law.
A multi-stakeholder tells the STT that the document can't be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of Interior refused to release the list of participants at the Minister of the Interior’s events to the evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Government Office and on the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not on the file.
The Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tells the STT that there is a noticeable need to reform the policies of the Ministry.
Usai Bolti’s last Olympics show begins in Osai.
In recent years, Bolt has been running against time under value charges.
He hurt his past in the early days and had to skip the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in a much better condition.
I've been doing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fans who turned into fans.
While around the Pomina Bolt, it is clear that the Jamaican star has risen over a period of time when public sports has been struggling with doping scandals and sledding interest.
The last loss of Bolt at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 meters early at 21.05 p.m.
At that time, Bolt, a 17-year-old, was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he crushed the world record and the competitors' confidence in the final grand jury in spite of the year 9,69.
This is hard to do.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the mark at the clock.
World records created in Europe are 9,58 at 100 metres and 19 in the 19th century are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is reaching 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds below world record, but nobody believes that it is created but Bolt himself.
In the 100th century, the Botti’s first challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the Athenian 2004 100 Olympic Award winner.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost its worth in the finals of value losses since the reign in Beijing, if only has been completed.
In Daegus 2011, the 100-mmm final was left on Bolt for running for a fake start.
Bolt fills up for more than a week after 30.
He's an old man with young men, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
For the first time in a career, Bolt has set the World Cup in London next year.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of the world.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Distinguishings about Italy: two athletes are suspected of doping.
According to Xinhua of the U.S. Press Office, Chinese financier Chen Xinyi, 18 has given a positive doping sample at the Olympics in Rio.
The Chinese judge Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Also, Bulgarian lawyers, Silvia Danekova, are suspected of doingping crime.
In addition, the Royal Public Sports Coach was transited to my home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormones.
He was located in Rio, fourth of all, on a hundred-metre fly-in flight of women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estao, the Chinese fin has taken a case of doping before the International Court of Appeal for Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyin Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspicions of doping have also been reported in Rio.
BBC found that Bulgarian female drunkards Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epi-hormones.
Kenya, in turn, has been asking about Rio home to the sports coach for doping.
The International Olympic Committee on Thursday reported that the Kenyan coach had acted as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been on a 800-meter race pass from the runner Ferguson Rochi.
Pseis will not stop anything - historical gold from becoming a display style.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the United States Michael Phelps, swimming 200 meters in a mix-up in 22nd Olympics.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold already.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the same species of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive games.
The payout period for Phelps was 1.5.5.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino was in a mixed swim, second before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, Olympic Commentator of the BBC, Helen Skkelton's laugh at the quick interview with the press.
The case of Helen Skkelton (of course) on Monday is one of the most readings this week on the website of the Evening Newspaper.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skkelton is not much stressed if the som or British press has a small mess of his undiscovered and special costumes.
Television is a visual media, he stresses.
Skkelton has put on high-interest shoes and short dress, which certainly has at least sufficient transparency - at least for many conservative British girls.
However, back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small cases are just a funny thing.
Skkelton certainly wants to be astounded and perhaps astounded, but he points out that he does not want to play the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't really matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that matters is how much these swimmers are doing and how much they're making, it's okay for me, Skkelto grinning.
You know what?
It comes out of nowhere if it comes from (the drinker) looking out.
I'm a little amused if this guy's hit someone's radar.
The police in the police arrested two arrests for suspicion of suspicion.
The police in Rio announced on Thursday that it had arrested two persons for suspicion of terrorism.
Police are arresting the police in connection with the safety oversight of the competitions.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two individuals before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 website, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police arrested in July.
The prisoners are believed to have contacts with the Isis Committee.
The prisoners had been known to have caused violence on social media.
Messages encouraging violence had been disseminated, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio’s competitions is equivalent to 85 000 policemen.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball arenas and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after a controlled blow-up of the package by the police.
This was the third time in the Rio Olympics, when the police have carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The audience came in after the police had verifiedly blew up the package.
The public did not record it by the beginning of the match, because the police closed the arena to the ground because of the suspicious package found in the lobby.
The police blew up the package and let the public in the administration only after that.
The pop-up toasted the competitions to a sleepy start-up Spain team.
Spain, who started the two-stage race, won the Nigerian score of 96-87.
In the two previous competitions, Spain reached silver.
For the first time during the Rio summer season, the operator carried out a controlled explosion mission.

Spain and Nigeria started their initial match for the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty audiences.
The Argentinian lady was advocating Petja-Sirenä - Finnish questioner of protest.
Tuuli Pető-Siren had a colourful competition day at the same time.
Tuuli Pető-Sire experienced hard on Thursday.
On Thursday, the Argentinian lady was the winner of Tuul Petja-Siren in Rio at the opening of the day of female surfing.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent issued a breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped, the Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
An athlete would consider long-term protest.
It was not worth doing so, because it would have been useful according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to make up for it, Petja-Siren said.
The Finnish people hung on their shoulders until the last time, because they did not want to go into the dirty water in Rói.
The Finnish person remained in place of the 27th time after the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Capital medal for 2012 is the eighth.
The damage to the fever does not have much effect on the crash.
Friday is an important day when it is time to race for departures 10-12.
Modify 2013/9: Unlike from the first information, Petja-Siren did not object.
7 specific issues which, according to science, are long-term on-age.
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into the life of a person.
There are ways in which a person, directly or indirectly, is directly affected by things so that his life is extended.
Sometimes, things that you cannot influence yourself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to have a central body household or social status.
Immediate shopping may be of a longer age.
There's always no need to snooze, just to get a milky milky one.
The long-term secret has been addressed through a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily rapporteur presented the five most recent results of the study.
Science suggests that all these things may lead to more life years.
Drinking beer and coffee.
It has been shown that culinary drinking protects against some cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
Research from Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "low risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, the studies once again state that reasonable use - one in three days - may lead to prolonged life.
For example, one found that wine-drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
The normal use of a toothpaste can prolong a person’s life for up to six years, one study reports.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents the idea of being infected.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other human bodies.
A study conducted in Norway found out how a person’s life was affected by a person’s life span.
The seven-year project surveyed more than 55,000 people.
Those who nabbed more were the most hideous individuals 35 per cent likely to survive after the end of the test.
Sex, when gender-related protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
Besides, it can also last a lifetime.
It's just that having sex is not enough.
In order to gain additional years of life, a person should also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solitude.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large buttocks had higher cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these elements with lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete at the Olympics or an actor who won the Oscars, he is more likely to live longer than the ordinary layman.
Many research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious human is likely to live in a way that brings further years of life to his life.
Researchers, again, suspect that for a long time the social status of a person is due to - which, for its part, allows for the purpose of awards such as the Nobel Prize - for example.
A study on shopping behaviour among people over 65 years of age found that daily shopping is likely to be a parent who makes purchases.
This is due to the fact that, in the current trades, rounding reduces loneliness.
It has been re-assessed to launch biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
Thus, calculating your credit card by hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver in the U.S. driver's car swept out towards the truck.
On Friday night in Koskella in South-Suomi, there was a serious billiard of truck and passenger cars on Friday night.
The accident took place in Koskella, in the middle of the Kosfields and Sorbastes on Friday at 21:00.

Teija Haltia, who was in the perni, was on Thursday to buy raspberry candy at Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign was hit in the eyes.
There are product deficiencies in the UK because Posti delivered our loads to the Seinäjoki River.

The trading sign relates to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to grass cutting as well.
The grass cut is available for Post until the end of August.

The update's popularity hit me with an ass.
The representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the point of this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia was over 700 copies on Facebook.
Haltia was able to get her own favorites caught in a wallet bag, even though some of the lairs were empty.
Jaakko Kaideja, who was responsible for the business of Posti Business Transport Services, was sorry for the damage to Ista-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stagers were lost yesterday in the right place (Seinäjoki) and we were no longer going to make a sub-action (Salo) on three, but we only took five stage today, Kaedesoja told Evening Santom.
The first news of the matter is the Evening Sanomat.

Putin separated the head of his administration from his master in place of an Estonian-language Vaino.
President Vladimir Putin has resigned President Sergei Ivanov, Head of the President's Administration, the Kremlin.
President of the Communist Director-General of the Soviet Union, Karl Vaito's grandson Anton Vaino will be in place.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the Press Office Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his administration.

BBC: ManU’s gambling for a game ban can’t be seen in the opening of Valiolig’s opening.

He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and that will be a single match ban.
That curfew has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next game is on the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, mass mass waste is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of convenience have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event aimed at the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival will begin on a Friday in Helsinki.
The painters have typically expressed themselves with their own personal work.
One of the artists on the main stage is this year's punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed by artificial grass and art installations, for example.
It has never been enough for us to be just a headboard and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival held this weekend in the Gulf of Helsinki has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors’ events.
As a result of the success, the question is simple: What kind of event do the authors want to go to?
In events, it is quite different to think this way.
Often, the objective is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the decisions, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year's sale.
The objective has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 last year by 5,000 people.
A number of interesting national and foreign artists are also seen at the festivals this year.
The increase in quantity is a good thing because it's supposed to be funding in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at any point, it would be like a cattle herd controlled by a huge lineage.
We don't want to.
The ideology of a successful event has expanded over the past 13 years with some of the presences of 130 in the artificial grass-seated area, art installations, numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performers, this year 15 000 people will have tents.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out again.
I may be a little crazy, but at the same time we've been able to save Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that even today's great visions are in practice possible.
During the early years of the event, activities in the mid-2000s were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of a public limited company operating Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can also create "creepy things", such as building a 73-foot wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
In addition to the musical event, it is possible to talk about the community of trendy older adults.
However, the event has not knowingly become a particularly fashionable event.
The right to distinguish first and foremost with content is the right to separate.
Still, fashion phenomena match Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own generation, but he does not have the most typical features of the festival that combines indierck, pop music, rap and solo.
According to Kallio, Iggy was flattered because it is probably the last time this is seen in Finland.
We are interested in everything, the world and the future.
It's not just what's playing on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done a hell of a job in recent years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist destination were hidden in flower jars - tourists fled in their horrors.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday evening.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had obviously been hidden in a flower jar and blew up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which were foreign customers.
They were blown up while tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, according to the CNN of the police representative Samoer Yoosumra, CNN.
A picture of your attacks by a wild animal guardian Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia since 1989.
If the tv doesn't look good, you can look at it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded by the bar.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Emeli Olsson Aftonbladet, Sweden’s secretist Emeli Olsson.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than, the next morning of the local time.
At least one death.
The number of wounds is not yet known.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the most popular island of Phuket as well as in Finland.
No one is known to be dead.
Meanwhile, there was another double-bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
The police informed them about Hua Hin, who had yet to explode, that at least one bomb was reported to be missing.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the public authorities, there may also be criminal organisations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken advantage of the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by team leaves in the event of a war situation before the battle.
In an acute war situation, soldiers are asked to perform military duties only after several months after the oath of the military force, reports Central Finland.
According to the head of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5.5 months of military service personnel in the event of a war, only those who are at the end of their training are able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, first of all, the service is assigned to the stand-by services of the reserve staff.
No backup or reserve member is required to carry out a mission that has not been trained as required, says Sonnen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are about to train military personnel to the immediate standby units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola received a colossal compensation from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a fierce dispute about the housing they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-layered household had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trading in the house, a serious moisture problem has been revealed, which has created a dangerous microbial growth for health.
The municipality announced that it would sell the dwelling as a decommissioning condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so Tola and Waroma had lost up to EUR 1 9 000.
The couple brought the case before the court and demanded that the price be charged to the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and the province.
The court delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs and expenses of the couple's trial and settlement expenses totalling EUR 47 344.
The court held a slight price reduction because a certain amount of the need for house replacement had already been known to the buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the court court, manifested errors in construction were substantially more serious than what had been reported.
Tola is looking for a good home.
Tola told me in the marriage that the couple had actually sought a home of good faith because they didn't want to go into repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report would not be harmful to him.
The evaluation report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding rain and melting water.
However, the work did not show that it was in any way of urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained convinced that the rainwater of the late days might need to be channelled a little over a few years.
The trades took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems in the dwelling were much more likely to be serious than expected.
The 2012 and 2013 inspections showed micro-organisms in the building, which according to witnesses were due to both the rainwater of the rock and the soil moisture that capillaryly increased.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the auditor's estimate, have reached the indoors through the porch as well.
A safe and safe-to-health-to-health-to-risk, limit values were found in the home-room, basement stairwell, living room airlocker, and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also held a dispute as to whether the housing was in breach of the extended building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma had not known before the trade that the decision of the City of Espoo to modify the housing was contrary to the consent of the City of Espoo.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there was not yet an appropriate permit.
However, problems were a key issue in justice.
According to court law, buyers, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, assumed that the building was suitable for living on its own and that there was no need for substantial repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider that there was any reason for the court to carry out a more general audit in the ordinary way.
The purchasers have not failed to fulfil their reporting obligations, the Court of Justice ruling in its judgment.
Fascinating archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Natsi register also Finns.
Editor Christher Andsson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter on how the National Library of the United States of Maryland has recorded microfilm records covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also U.S., French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and licenses originate from the Nazi German Racial Office.
The racial office was under the authority of the SS Director-General Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
Equally, to an even greater extent, women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out on women in order to find out.
The Racial Office examined the background of women, among other things, through the study of church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in women's lineage.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the race agency the manuscripts of life and good recommendations close to them.
The Racial Office wanted guarantees that women were "beloved children", "saves", and "good national socialists", who knew very much about German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride of SS men.
The story is not about how 14 Finnish women found in the file were found in the file.
The head of the SS created a state-supported program known as Lebensbor in 1936.
The programme provided, inter alia, that each SS official should have four children, whether in marriage or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside their marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very active, but the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are on the pages.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State's initiative to get married provides loans and support for having children.
A German mother’s honour was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between "Aryans" and "Non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, the museum's website states.
Petja-Sire on the sixth, Nirkko rose and fell and fell.

Jari Sillahään Random City was taped for a couple of hours of nights: "I was so in a bag".
Jari Silalä has been a member of Finnish favourite artists for more than 20 years.
The Star of the cruise ship's barge to become the tango king of 1995, the solo artist most widely sold in Finland, and the Star of the Dances and Festivals, the Sillapää will continue to snort and she is currently at a sharp rise.
A book on the life of a pet singer, written by Koppinen, was published today on Thursday by Jari Siltanpää.
In the book Silanjuää tells about his life and career as well as about evil.
The career of the bridge rose to a total praise for his victory at the Tango King’s Tung market in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition Sillajää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopopamaki had composed a tango piece for Silla pole at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen put in a slightly different form.
In fact, it became one of Finland’s most popular songs in the music history of Finland.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The other side sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after just a few hours of nights.
We had a party last night.
I was so in a bag.
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know that it's been written next door.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and perfect all the time.
The second one of the most popular songs of a man, which is mentioned in the book, happened nearly twelve decades later.
In 2013 Silt Head resigned from his then partner, and the case ended up with You too earned a gold copy of the texts published as single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered at the Saara Crescent were not like the Songhead wanted to.
The head of the bridge had imagined making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and the ex-loved divorce, Jari was told that she was over-represented and alcohol abused, but Jari said that it was full-blown and that it was not true.
Jari called the book, saying that she was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up meeting it - and that's right.
In June, the British were holding themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polls of the voting week suggest the opposite outcome.
The British economic and economic leaders and economic institutions were close together in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university applied for a divorce, although a few individual researchers may have disagreed with the power of their profession.
The theme of the former US President Bill Clinton's election campaign yesterday, called "It's the economy, step", flew to the ground in the British Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices didn't hear.
They were shocked when, apparently, the economy is not the real thing about politics.
The economic passion language of the country.
Centre for Macroeconomics in the latest monthly survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most common answer is that the economic owners and the polls were not, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
An explanation of the loss of the economic position of one-on-one owners is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British side.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it would favour the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Commission for Europe, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economicists was not sufficiently established.
They were particularly praised by the equality of the BBC, which gave just as much space as a couple of per cent of economics in favour of the EU as an overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press did not care to share the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE on the consequences of the differences in economic capital letters.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke truthfully of economic growth, trade relations, debt and currency.
And if the messages of the Economists were both heard and understood, they were not conveyed because the Economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel that there is any common interest in voting.
Of course, the academics of big cities such as economics would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will push you into a hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more work would the workers have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctor's appointments if they weren't?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the children of the right Brits get to a job if we got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every area.
How much more space would the natives have if they were gone?
Here they are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond and, if successful, their replies did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security, thanks to the immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
The Aberdeen real estate reserve was reserved for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to her, in Aberdeen there was an early booking for Brexit by developing plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote on Plan B, i.e. the EU-responsible camp, began to be reserved for the victory of the camp in favour of the EU, in the event that the result would be on leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds away from the market.
As a rule, real funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be necessary now.
We used to pay off cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or in liquid assets, says Vananen of Aberdeen's only open daily book-circulation fund that the news was about.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the Fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, the Old One says about all the open real estate funds of UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, the reserves were prepared for Brittany in a very different manner.
The funds shut down the trade.
When the European camp won, Europe went awry.
However, the last few two weeks following the vote on the real market were quite calm," Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Central Bank, in which he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
Base funds first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These two combined beat the situation and raised the matter to the main ends of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately approached between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained close, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund had to shut down after each other.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the collected cash, but it also had to freeze for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't really close the deal, they changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out paniclessly.
The message of Aberdeen was that, if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of the report was withdrawn.
Since then, it was quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar cohesion between the Manner European Funds of Aberdeen, for example.
A lot of polls came up.
disproportionate attention to the reserve funds.
The elderly felt that the closures of the trade in real estate funds received disproportionate attention.
The open funds covered by the closures manage approximately 4 % of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days and the company sold less than 10 properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its funds for 2017 and 2017 respectively.
At present there is uncertainty, and economic growth forecasts have gone downwards, but the situation does not seem to be "more positive" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite doubt, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen points out.
The rate of pounds and dollars is lowest in 30 years, and in addition, the market has 15% discount sales compared to the Brixit vote at the earliest.
The dollar player can now buy the same property at a cost of up to 30%.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought sales to London's real estate market in London.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation did not seem to be much different yet.
However, at 4 a.m. when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, the UK Real Estate Fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
There you go.
I realized this was going to plan B, but Vanhanen says in another home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive in spite of the morning.
The television screens, which were normally meant to be silent by the office, were familiar with the news, and the people who were usually silent to listen fully when Mrs. David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screen terminals blinked all red.
It was a morning that never believed to be alive, says Vanhanen.
It is not true that, despite the riot, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. two real estate trades.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the option was well prepared for the future, and therefore the situation was quite calm," Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started with a change of order.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound went out, the British leadership went on a shift.
The market was expected to have fierce bills for the British and especially London real estate markets.
Up to 20% mines were planned for London offices in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze into trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so much for six days.
Now it's broken down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on the face of the Ancient.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been identified as a matter of priority.
The information from CBRE on price developments of the CBRE covers about one-third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London real estate fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the deficit increased by 6.1 per cent, Old One is reading.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same high figures occurred between 2007 and 2008 in the period 2007-2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was quickly available for the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis on the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the comparison is not quite appropriate, as this is a British domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is different, too.
In the real market, there is now not a sale like that of time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There is also a normal amount of money available.
In any case, the repair movement could have been in the face of any event the repair movement could have been in the face.
In fact, the price adjustment is no wonder of him - it could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of London and other world-high city buildings have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the fall started very high.
London prices have written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
The second major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalising, says Vanhanen.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investments abroad.
London is an easy destination for a well-known city.
In addition, low interest rates have been used to feed prices, which is why pension companies, for example, have had to look for income from new destinations.
The loan on this loan has been readily available - although, according to the old man, the bond has now been used significantly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Split up, spread out.
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten his own holdings in London, and last year was a net sale.
There was some kind of translation to be expected, and now it's here.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy is developing, says Vanhanen.
He's not afraid to judge the future, but he says he's hardly allowed to do anything in the field.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even process ahead of us.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in real estate.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we're getting through the holes at work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of a victim of it.
If it is decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
The S-group will begin to register for more information about shopping information.
The S Group will know what you are eating, as the commercial group told us today that it will start to collect more detailed information on the purchases of its customers.
So far, once the data has been collected from the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to fish for the products purchased at the beginning of May as well.
The S-group is coming after Kesko, as the data on the goods purchased with the extra card have been collected in the Kesko Customer Register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riita's feedback on the programme has been very positive.
Detailed information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing on an authorised basis.
The most effective channel is an email.
In rare cases, the customer has banned the use of product information, Riitala tells Ässanom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the transformation of the S-Group.
Kesko already categorizes its parent client in ten groups according to mere purchases.
The classification is updated monthly.
The applicant customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
The detailed purchase data will only be collected from the K-Group's own chain.
Partners, such as Lester Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a host client program and does not have this kind of planning.
Finland's Finland's local retail has its own Yhikösbonus customer program, which can be associated with selection houses, Siwai and Euromarkets.
Currently, we do not collect data at product or group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made, the day on which the purchase was made, and the total amount of the receipt from the customer.
We have not gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer programme will be reformed in the future, but the Mediterranean trade will discuss this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that the product information will not be registered.
Start playing with the game.
The SOK Customer and Customer Register has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address data, the basic information has included vocational training, education, housing, years of birth of the child and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-first buying-in has been entered in the register for the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, the S-boning partners’ data have been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data on S-marks, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had the hope that the marketing could be further targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, the customer and partner manager of SOK.
The S-group informs the customer of its way of informing the customer about the change.
These may prohibit the use of specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is recorded in the baskets in any case, whether or not it is stored.
A willing person can check his or her deposited data on the S-Group website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to the information, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is the newest dog-reinforcement in the world of Customs's latest dog-reinforcement platform will be the first explosive dog in the world.
The maze of the Labrador's cub is heavily ravaged by five similar boxes in the same country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a jar of shells snoring the field gas.
The liquid gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila-dog.
Security and Online Trade Accesses
Heila is the first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main job as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Customs and, following the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, the Inspector General of Customs.
The second access to training for weapons and explosives in Customs duties is the delivery of mail via Helsinki Airport.
Every year, as a result of the increased internet trade over the airport, up to 40 million mail broadcasts, including weapons and explosives, may be available abroad.
In recent years, customs has made about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, available online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will be working all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered baggage and mail items.
In the ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of its performance, Customs will assess whether further weapons and explosives symptoms will be trained in the future.
Grönberg welcomes the idea.
School Monday
Heila-puppet training is co-ordinated by the Customs School of Dogs at the University of Tull on Sundays.
The force also visits police and defence personnel to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in the training of dogs and in the training of explosives known to the Defence Forces.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They will always be trained as appropriate, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs, money and drugs Massi.
Labremister Heila has been selected from the ten puppies of the puppy.
The selection criteria of the dog chosen for the airport include snooping and hunting, as well as calmness, as the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close work partner with the inspector, but also a family member.
There's no way without Heila to get home, Suntio Goes to the house.
Mild orders go to Heila from a one-off box.
The camera camera in the evening is missing a fast dog's mike cover, but Heila immediately restores the cover that looks like a soft toy from a "irti" hand.
Hard competition from work to work.
The initial training of the helke will be completed next year.
There are still levels of tests ahead, next October, where an assessment of whether the training is necessary for the required tasks is to be carried out.
Heilä can see a job in Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes as planned.
Passengers cannot, unfortunately, come to iron the dog on top of the work vests, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one dog at work is about EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be longer, from 8 to 10 hours, but active participations can last only from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs employees.
On the site of Suntion, which has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and in the field of supervision in Tulli.
The country was given its first Olympics - the nation gets a day off.
The Olympics in Fiji, with less than one million inhabitants, are valued so high in the country that the government has set August 22nd as a national day off.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian Government has confirmed that the matter has been resolved by the master's title.
The day off will be held the day following the team’s return home.
The hero team is also authorised by national courts in its country of origin.
Fijian Rugby Team Festival Championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final capital city of Suur, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only the native Fijians are interested in Rugby, but this game united our multi-cultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said Maikele Seru Guardian, editor of the Fiji Times.
Dramaa, in the island of Rio Dramaa - the Finnish Finnish translator fainted after the performance of the miracle after the miracleing.
The printing company, Milko Tokola, managed with the last company 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature to provide for the take-off.
During or shortly after the pick-up of the loads, he has been fainted many times.
No one's ever known why.
In Tokola, the result of the push was 1,75 kg and the blow was 1,5 kg.
The total cost of her co-financing was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her last job at a rate of 5'7 pounds, as well as another one.
In the wild business, the weights rose as a result of a fierce screaming.
The body was shaking under weight until the Queen accepted the lift.
The fact that he has suffered from knee problems was a joy for the Finnish publicist.
ROPS got a Estonian-sponsor Prosan - Fleet League - Evening Sanomat.
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a permanent agreement with Albert Prosa, the Estonian champion, for a period of time.
We are looking for a lead player with power and a threshold to enter Finland and Rovaniemi for our team.
We went through a lot of 50 players from around the world with 10 player agents.
As a good alternative to Prosa, coach of ROPS, Juha Malinen explained in the bulletin, Prosa began to separate himself from the crowd.
Prosa, 25, arrives at Rops from a farm-based Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played with the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with ROPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis face the SJK of the master of Finland.
There was a need for another assailant for Rops when last year's earthly King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star once again meets: the teenage Shorts reveal almost everything.
The modern Family Comedy of Alex Dunphyna has become familiar with Ariel Winter's comedy comedy comedy again by introducing her mighty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in ministurs, which do not leave much to imagine.
The Shorts revealed not only the player's legs but also this backside.
Winter, 18-year-old, has recently taken a lot of attention by changing his style and behaviour far more courageous.
The star has posed very little in images published in social media and has taken a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen in very few costumes.
Winter, which is the threshold for all eternity, has recently also published several pictures of himself at the meeting.
If the picture does not show, you can look at it here.
Last summer, Fox News asked the assistant why Winter has changed his image so radically.
Then, the founder and CEO of the ThormenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had "typical Hollywood transformation" going on from the child star to the beginning.
He has been on TV for almost his whole life and grew up in the time of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, the more Palmer says to Fox News and adds that just the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series, which was only 11 years old.
The actor has been agitating some of his long-term fans with his immigration.
It is not hard to know where he will be in 10 years, when the dinky is already so hard, says a woman in Winter.
Some of the fans, on the other hand, are defending the actor and insisting that criticism be ignored.
You look great.
I don't care what the others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman excels.
People of the Nordics prefer Finland to attract tourists to Finland with a revival: In the autumn, it is possible to see a randommirr aurora in the autumn.
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their re-entry trips from the beginning of autumn," says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese renewal tourism.
Revoon lights are super cards for our winter trips and are closely connected to winter and snowy landscapes.
There is well demand for the winter winter renewal stores of the magazine, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely knows that the restoration season begins from an early autumn and goes on to spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see a so-called ‘mirr aurora’, where the surface of the lake reflects the revisions of the vision of a double-fold random, reports Anne Lind, marketing manager at Visit Finland.
The main focus group of visit Finland’s revival campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, through online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by the University of Aalto and the University of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see the most obvious unique attractions in Finland, and this fleet has a huge potential, according to Lindi.
Nights spent by tourists in Finland have increased clearly more in other Nordic countries than in Finland.
Last year they spent more than double nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese as a target group for Finnish tourism are interesting because they spent more than €80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for the silver Rugby-7 tournament when Fiji's team won gold.
The United Kingdom’s leading success in the seven player Rugby competition was crushed by the crush when Fiji won it in the finals played at the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, up to 43-7.
Fiji gave master's education in ball handling, transmissions, side-outs, support game, running trains and brutals, and won this gold if it was the first Olympic Games in its entire history.
The loss was silver, which was a bit thiner than the comfort to Britain, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They may be proud of their success at the first Rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic Olympics, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
South Africa's tight winnings from Boxes, up to seven to five semifinals, on the same day earlier, could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won you, even if 15-person teams had been full of power.
The fact that at least one British can get tomorrow's gold medal: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, former English Rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite an experience for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Mexico, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is astounding.
Fiji has been a great starter and presented his tacit skills to the United Kingdom, as if for fun.
It looked like Tom Mitchel's teams were hit by moving buses, and the world champions rose to 5-0 leaders when Osea Kolinisau took a run at the corner of the attack.
At the time of four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal right from the paint kick.
Situation 12-0, and the United Kingdom had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's great shock prevents the rational Leone Nakarawa from making a third paint, but it didn't take long to delay Fidz's journey.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored the right corner, after which the United Kingdom was at a loss of 17-0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal on the follow-up, when the first half of the game time was still more than a minute left.
Vatemo Ravouvuou then rushed through even more powerful tacs of the United Kingdom team and ran over the finish line.
After the earthquake, the opening period ended in a situation between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the rugby of the seven players, while the British are still in the role of the learner.
Which is, to a large extent, true.
The United Kingdom made major changes in the mid-term and managed to hold the Fijian wholes for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored with the excellent team of Fijins.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down to the point 36-7 by making a goal for the United Kingdom to the left, but the game had long since been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose fans were singing, swinging flags and dancing in front of them.
It was hard not to admire the pure glamorous attitude of Fiji.
Mata Vilime finished the scouring on the Fijian cake by making paint at the last minute.
The bell, the Fijians embraced each other, and the Britons fell into the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fiji had won Japan's semi-finals by Chapters 20 to 5, and the United Kingdom was attracted to South Africa by a strict semi-final in which the balance was resolved by the UK's goal.
Brown took South Africa's Boxes to the top during the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and ran under the paint poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of the player Anthony Watson, who is the player of the 15th player's Rugby team, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold.
This emotional quality could not be in these competitions.
The first bet on the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed with 220 winning bets in history and found an additional purpose for gold at the Estacio da Laga.
Even though they were two in the air, the third in the boat was the voice of coach Robin Williams, who allowed them to make their second consecutive Olympics in women's twins, which makes them the first women in the history of British sport, which is about to achieve the same achievement.
Their power was incontrovertible, the victory was already their 39th consecutive and once again recordable.
What we see, two great athletes on the surface of water like you do, does not fully match the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each row of the gold, each of which has, for some, taken two towards the achievements. However, the most important of the officials is the coach in which the cancer was diagnosed 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
At least the situation at the time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and I was able to cut off the tumor.
From surgery it would have been widespread throughout the whole range of operations.
the weather would have been bad.
It changes the way it is used."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Wednesday was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside of the seasoner at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if in such circumstances you can even say so now.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around Division 6, 9 and 15 meters apart when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's it.
The row itself is already on the way, but this made it much bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the twin thoughts were at Williams, who had taken a nervous morning and spoke much more than normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Armoured Regiment, who was behind him on a trip to Afghanistan, says: "I've been at the feeling level this week in the ruins, which may be a bit extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we work together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, the cashier of Helen and Robin has been fantastic.
Robin would be nothing, so incredibly thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The two are the overwhelming rhythms that their competitors have failed to impose on them.
Even at the last 500 metres when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught in the moment.
Sign up "Stop with me, stay with me."
It is very important that we do not run away from the route."
"We were doing well, and at the same time, we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We did not pursue the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good deal and win the race we did."
The two of my questions for a year before deciding on the future.
Glover will be at his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature programmes.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't mean to say that this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
It was so new, and I was very stressed out.
It took about four minutes to understand this time.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland is exchanging the Government of Panaman leak-circulated government.
In October, Iceland will hold the early parliamentary elections required by the protestors of Panama's data leaks already in spring.
The so-called Panama paper revealed the tax burden of several Irish politicians by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election at the time.
The election day is now closed on October 29th.
Analysts suggest that it is difficult to predict how much last year's passion affects the autumn election.
During the June presidential elections, criticism of the rulings was clearly evident, and a policy was elected as President of Gudni Johannes, a candidate from the outside.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald Trump, president of the United States of America's Presidential Committee, has withdrawn his most recent referees.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of a union organisation, Isis, and Democratic League Hillary Clinton, involved in the establishment of an organisation.
The Democratic Party was upset about the speeches and asked for forgiveness from the Right.
The commander of the army should never be allowed to let anyone who could sink that way, your Clinton sign.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a muslim-like burkini swimsuit on the beaches, including the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the coasts and to go to a swimming area without a good manner and a secularismic swimsuit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are highly expressive of religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of a terrorist attack.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into the population celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two fact-finding organizations, who joined Isis, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the selenium - on Lake Pyykösjärv, the blue seam.
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-collar rescue has been observed on the shores of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other common bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coastline of the sea basin, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria were below the limits laid down by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water content of seaweed bathing water E.coli and enterococcal concentrations were established on Wednesday, when the concentrations of bacteria had fallen below the limits of the measures.
The blue seam found on the shore of the lake of Pyhäsjärvi does not yet make water unsustainable, but in favourable circumstances the situation may change even as a bluefish flower, where the water surface is composed of blue-green resting plates.
The measures will follow the situation with more frequent checks.
If there is a change in the blue-leathering patterns, the information on this issue will also be provided on the bathing record.
Look at the results of bathing water samples from here.
MKK's HARTA's Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside the forest owners.
The forest contribution is one tax transition in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax levy to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the conversion of the forest holding.
At the Ministry of Finance's request, forest talent reduction has four objectives: to promote the generation changes in forestry, to increase the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest space and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial agriculture.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry is good, to comment on the forestry producers' association (MTK)'s Director General Juha Haharainen.
However, the venturer finds critical tax returns in the proposal.
It is proposed that the forest-based premium be charged for the pure income of the forest-owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the opinion of the MKK and Hakaraiinen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sale of wood.
At the VM's end-of-life survey, the fact that a reduction in the net income of the forestry industry prevents the loss of income from forestry, which should be reduced by other taxes, will prevent it from becoming a loss of income from forestry.
A person will gain tax benefit even if he does not wood mine.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to visualize it, says Haharainen.
The model also applies to only a small part of forest owners according to him.
The tax reduction limit for the value of the forest is set at EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn too high by Häärais.
As such, he claims that 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the scope of the exemption.
The model would have an impact on about 10 % of the forest management community, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the border guarantees the purpose of growing the farm size.
The forest-based forest gift reduction has been drawn according to Haharais for decades.
Against this background, the management of forest-ownership and land-use management is based on the management of forest-ownership.
According to the JRC, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and around half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful raspberry surprised the carmakers in Himanga - two cars went back into the ditch and ran into each other.
There was a special pursuit of the Kalajoki Himanga on Friday afternoon.
According to the rescue facility, two vehicles in a row of time went back into the ditch, after which the rear came to the rear after the previous drive.
According to President Harri Pyhäti, the fireman of the Sun's Fireflies, the abandonment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong coup.
There were two people in the car that were back in time who were both transported to the hospital.
There is no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the driver of the driver of the driver of the driver of the driver's car did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Recent research results from the University of Turku researchers can help to improve the efficiency of cancer treatments.
The findings of the research group of Academic Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of a cancer in the cancer increases the malignant quality of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by concentrating treatment with cancer cells in addition to the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 September in the Nature Communications magazine on Cell Biology, which has been evaluated in the field of cell biology.
In the court, the D.A. demands a murder conviction also for another perpetrator.
The death of Muhtu's family home is due in court for both convictions.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for family home deaths in Muhek.
The second received 8 years of 4 months, among other things, from the murder and the gross robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and brutal robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of the gross protection of road safety as a young person and of the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The Prosecution was chosen by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received the severer judgment.
The D.A. demands that a less convicted person be convicted of a murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of making.
According to the district court, the 17-year-olds killed the school’s child care unit supervisor who worked for the man last July.
The 17-year-old, who was the victim of the murder, attacked the manager on the couch in the rearwards, according to the reasoning of the judgment.
The director had taken off and put up with a young person in his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a suction pipe.
The director was also strangled with leadership, hit and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mental analysis, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice is the world's longest long-lasting vertebrate, and it will only grow at the age of 156.
The ice is confirmed in ice ice, reports a study published in the magazine "Absconding to the nearest living vertebrate".
In the north of the north, such as the ice-cream or hosker that wanders around Greenland, the ice-cream or hosker may live to the age of 400.
The female will not grow until 15 years of age.
The fact that it will only grow a centimeter a year makes it more sustainable for me to live more.
Only one species of clams is known to be longer than live iced sharks.
Researchers found out about age by radio-carbonisation.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The parent's age was estimated at 392 years - although throwing in the right direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic guide - News from the People
Donald Trump's America does not change the world's needs.
Up to a third State would not be able to obtain any income from all taxes if the change in corporate tax imposed by Donald Trumpi was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by means of tax incentives that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolution in presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax fell from 35% to 15%.
It would not be worth picking up a really high sum of 1 000 billion dollars a year.
The excess income tax rate now stands at 39,6, after the reduction proposed by the Finale 33.
The levy was fully waived from the levy.
Trump accused the State of overregulation of the economy and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The aims of the hurdles must be re-established and energy regulation must be re-established.
The security reform of Barack Obama must be brought to a new discussion.
The administration must designate "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to the "damaging" trade policy, the US is one of the major causes of the problems.
The Free Trade Agreements would be set aside.
Imports from China would be reduced by 45% for imports and 35% for imports from Mexico for penalties.
We will provide a new future.
Americanism, not the universe, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump in Europe does not change the world's need:
American cars will be driving on the streets, American aircraft will unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully examined the talk written by the assistants, even though well-organised protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see the Trump program taking the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday in Finland.
A wave of attacks from the past - News of the People
The sea is on its way, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of the bridge of Madrid - the accounting of the past can begin.
It summed up the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance tour lovers (2013) was a funny and ronch-side satirical comedy, before the skin where I live, the tops of my career in Spain.
Like Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is an ideal sedentary love, human relations and family drama, centred on the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple and is widely seen as a long blockage.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be a surprise to the end of the movie in the first moments of a random encounter.
In the form of a return and a long letter, Julieta time life stages for an adult child who grew up.
He will begin from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
On the other hand, Julieta, as a young teacher, stands for Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series Ommelten (2013-2014).
Ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a shrub, but I would say myself that it's a bit strangely and literally by means of a wipe-out.
Almodóvar movies often have a fair distance to being so characterized by blasphemy as always to humor in Julieta.
It is a smoothly played, silent, place with good music in place and quite a dissatisfactioned film, which, as such, has an element in its life.
On the other hand, a typical visual colour vision for the light director is still maintained and so that it begins to inject a little more slowly in the eye as a pure shape than as an effective dramatistic measure.
The diseases, deaths or otherwise sharp losses that people are experiencing in the film, but the surface persists in a single cross.
This is particularly the case for a petition: in the case of a name person, housing changes from scene to scene, and the same applies to the remaining ears.
The almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the presentations of each scene, are not particularly improved.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three novels of Canadian Alice Munro, awarded at Nobel in 2013.
Novellit has been published in the book The Scratcher: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a little tacit written literature filming.
Subjects would have been emotionally inextricably inextricably more intense, so much big stuff - especially the subject of the film's subject, particularly the blatant guilt.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Majors: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Ruby de Palma, Daniel Grao, Drio Grandinette.
The first night of the film is 12.8 p.m.
The government is trying to re-elect - News of the People's People's News
No new surgeries are being done, pulsing ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, in the spring, head-to-head surgeries will be carried out at the top of the store.
There will be no new surgeries.
The four billion savings already made are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (coc) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's representation because the cuts in social security were decided on already in the spring circling.
Children's, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of compulsory insurance is reduced from 500 to 400 hours.
Training courses are in progress.
How do you expect to be treated?
Why do ministers so easily stress the fact that new cuts are not being made on these?
This year next year is the year.
The relics will be held in April and will be the main heat meter of the semester, not the gallulps.
It has also been shown that the outcome of a meeting in different directions of government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallets tell us that the government party expects the basic Finns to be killed, even though the outcome of its previous election was a modest 12.3 per cent lower than that of the parliamentary elections.
The Finns received 752 new councillors four years ago, most of which first spring will be realised at the cost of influence by the right government.
The life story of a three-part government of approximately equal size is in the case of the survival of the native Finns.
It has not been the case, but more than half of the voters got out of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visit have also surfaced.
There will be no new surges in rhetoric, not to be confused by the fact that next year they will be carried out radically and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected blow from the base Finns.
The majors in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be the other way around if the government of Sipilä is still in operation.
The government has set itself the target of undermining debt during this period, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After a great government, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the semester and admit that the government is unable to implement its own programme: indebtedness does not bend or even slow down.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means more and more severe events over the previous budget line for 2017 and beyond.
The budget would be poetized at least close to balance during 2018 and then, in spring, the parliamentary elections will take place against what will happen.
Such activities did not qualify for credit.
It is perfectly clear that the current measures on debt did not overcome, even though Juha Sipilä was trying to cause a positive feeling.
Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen's presentations to the information conference of the budget prove against it:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy temporarily pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this year and has lasted from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
With the immediately presented curves, government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery made by the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in fact be fully covered by new debts.
This is the idea of what is responsible for the central, assembly and basic Finns.
Question: The municipality wants to leave a lot of work to be done.
Three out of four think that organising children's day care, work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, as demonstrated by the study of the KAKS Foundation for Local Development (KAKS).
The majority of the people also assume responsibility for a single municipality for libraries, culture, civics, building supervision, university education and waste management.
The responsibility of the region as a whole is more clearly sought for regional planning, specialist care, vocational training, vocational schools and care for the disabled.
None of the tasks under the authority of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the State.
A underage driver drunk ran after a chase to get away from a cop.
In Joensuu, a 16-year-old motorcyclists drove a police patrol to escape in Joensuu on the Ilomants road at half past half past one.
The police were trying to stop the unlightened motorbike, but a young man left to drive the police to escape from fair speed.
The back drive continued on the Soyajarnanta road, from which it continued to the Sorronahot and the lower forest where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After that, a young man ran away from running, but a quick-legged cop ran off to the fugitive.
The driver's breath test showed 0.75 percentage points.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious safety protection measure.
The truck in the rock truck fell into the ditch.
The truck that was on the rock fell into the ditch on the Pävijärvi Cavin Road on Thursday night at 21:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell to a large extent in the ditch.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the broken truck through the door above the vehicle, together with the rescue helicopter staff and first-aids.
The owner of the vehicle left it to the vehicle’s owner to pick up the vehicle.
There was a hydraulic oil spilling out of the fallen truck that was absorbed by the rescue plant into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon on the Air River.
A woman aged 87 has been missing since afternoon in the Lahti village of the air river in southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six inches tall, tender and well-behaved, with white hair under the jaw.
Notices and hints of missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia centre’s tip number 0295440513.
Large-scale materials in the air - see the image gallery about the destruction of Parafest.
Para-Festival tents poured out by a flooding current caused by massive destruction.
The president of the Joenuu Para Society, Mr. Arto Pippuri, estimated that the festival would be economically available, and the event could also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will be held at the City Theatre's premises at 13.00 p.m. on the occasion of the presentation.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The fluctuation flow occurs in a cloudy cloud when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling air flow.
The changes in the state of water in the cloud are binding on heat and therefore the falling air is cooling and its speed towards the earth is speeding up.
The Meteorological Department has been informed that there are several flood flows in Finland during the summer.
The route of late flows is difficult to predict.
The crash current hit the scene of Parafest in the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum in the afternoon afternoon before 5 p.m.
The three tents fell to the ground, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly offended by the accident.
There was one child who was transported slightly injured to follow-up care.
The air temperatures are ageing in a variety of areas.
According to the study, the skin of the hips is getting older than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin aversion.
The British study is described by Evening Standard.
The British parent company Caci analyzed London's air’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, for example, the elderly living in rural areas.
Small particles that age skin are very bright dusty, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, die from nearly 9,500 lonhos each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to deliver the outer layer of the skin.
In Cacin's study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel on their way to work in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, in different masks, but it is recommended to regularly clean the skin as a more comprehensive solution.
The driver's brakes failed the man who stood in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went ahead, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor did, however, push the man to the point where he was transported to the central hospital, seriously injured by the investigation.
The tractor didn't have time to go any further, as it ran into the stones ahead.
The flow of new power into the coming period of time will take place.
The Liiga-Riento, a river-liner playing at the Ball Championship, leaves for a series starting in October from better starting points than I remember man.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tune is better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark in Rienno.
Jani Säsä, who continues to serve as the main coach in the field, will praise the new team to be tried and united.
From the foreign three to the middle combatant Fred Musoni begins another season in Riedon.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa and Hiago Garchet.

Through Joban, Kataja and the River Boys, to the U.S. national team.
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all of the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is going on, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better off in North America.
I was working and working with women in Turku when I took note of the announcement.
The U.S. was founded by a Salibandy national team.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumpanen, 48, says.
The champagne was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki the year before the year of birth.
In 1987, Jumpanen made it to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species is not yet played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later I played hockey in the SM series at the Yokipos, Jumppane's memory.
Jumppen played with the university's Salibandyn MS series for the period 1991-92, the next three years passed in Josba.
At the end of the meeting, he coached the A-daughters for the championship.
The women's MS series peaked in silver in 1995.
All in all, Jumppane played through the 10 series of women's MS, the balance was set at 169 in a total of 51+34=85.
The last SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team.
Joban was raised by the Joensuun Salibandy Society in Perttu Puska and the Enolike Tatu Kõnänen were elected to the Finnish national team, who will play in Czech Brno's EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, a 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this game before the six men's land fights, where he has been hit by a total of 9+4=13 points.
Zelkkaen Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the tourist and is part of the national team’s standard equipment with 117 landscaping.
The national team was also appointed to the tournament player Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cups last December.
The main coach of the Salibandymaa team is the Kontio Bayer Petri Kttunen.
The Essi Hasun circle of the volley artist closes to Kouvola - the SM-Skulka is missing from the prize cap.
Essi Hasu is about to end up as a beach volley player, at least after at least the current season.
Finland’s national championships will be decided this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in adult and young series.
In cooperation, six best pairs of each series of rankings will be awarded for the SM final tournament organised by Kouvola Aeroballers and the Finnish Aviation Union.
The live color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäe NMKY, who has been a member of the Finnish Beach Volley summits for several years now.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will be allowed to go to the pyjamas this weekend.
I'm sure the pesis stadium is going to have a great arena.
I haven't often played in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's nice to play in the finals at home, Hasu's feeling.
The Kou Vola region lit up Hasu's spark in sports and gave me a great lunch.
There are well-remembered memories of a child.
I started a volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-tails of Elimäe's NMKY.
On the top of the mind is too big a toy shirt, knee protection on the ankles, and the great hymns and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a community in which everyone knew each other.
The collective spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were closely involved - the teammate's father trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beat volleyy was already a natural selection of species during the junior season to counterbalance the inner balloon.
In the mid-1990s, biking has been played on the shores of Kärämmemi since the 1990s.
Gossk has always been active.
I also visited myself to watch the competitions of the junior MS tour, thinking that one day I would be at the game myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu will play the weekend together with Anniina Parkkis in the MS finals.
After Rikka Lehtenen and Taru Lahti, the second-rate twin's goal in the tournament is clear.
The realistic goal is to have a medal.
SM-gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws a mystery at us.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last familiar audience in Hasule.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work await new challenges.
The final round is after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least at least the toes will be placed on the nail, Hasu will plan.

According to the magazine, the follow-up to the event is at stake.
The great architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library is the front row of its magnificent architecture.
More information is available on the history of the Central Library of the city, when the local department of Southern California, the association of architectural historians, organises a presentation meeting, which is organised by Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, who have published a new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture".
Gee and Schwartzman will discuss and show pictures of the drawings of Bertram Goodhuen in 1926 and the restoration and additions made by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffe Associates in 1993.
The event will take place on 21 August at 14–16 at the Hall of Salle Moderne at the School of Law of Art Deco Southwestern School (former Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Blvd.
Participants can visit Central Hall, Period Rooms, Cactus Lunge and Tea Room.

An open, industrial Loft apartment in the centre of Los Angeles is experiencing a homey transformation of shape.
The 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library is clearly celebrated by a new book.
Tómn Koli bravely left for the farm company.
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and energy.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
The college started shortly two years ago with its little brother, Valteri Kol, as a successor to their home.
Markus Koli, his father’s father, helps and advises his brothers with his own experience.
As a rural enterprise, the start-up took over the debt and increased the volume so that the bread could come into cash from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a kid.
I've always been on the farm, and now that I've started myself as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in place.
If you start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a driveway, and at first, the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to join the project and have been fully involved in it, and Solomon Koli tells me and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still turn out good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who increases trucks, is to invest even bigger in his navets.
The work has brought results, since Solomon's College has been selected among the 10 best in the competition for young food producers in the Rural Future magazine.
At present, he is competing for a possible profit.
He will be able to vote on the website of the newspaper until 21 August.
Bulgaria shall report inflation for the first time in eight months to the Commission for the first time.
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it rises to more than zero after last October, when the country reported 0.2% of positive inflation.
The CPI average annual average inflation over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%).
Consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (July 2016 as a percentage compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, in July 2016, prices of the following categories of consumer products have increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level with the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, transport and training.
The anime effect of Snapchat Snapchat is criticised as an Asian caricature.
Snapchat says an anime that inspired this filter, but some observers think it's racist.
With Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play in real ways that approach absurdity.
You can change yourself into ananax, a dog or a character in painting Roy Lichtenstein.
Licens are inexplicable, feature-distorting tools designed to create more than 30 million enhanced self-evidents per day.
All misleading steps will soon come to the public's attention.
Snapchat lenses have received a criticism of where it has been accused of promoting blackface or bleached skin drapes as a beauty object.
So, when it offered some of its users this year a filter that turned their eyes off, wrongly teeth and made pubs out of the cheek, some critics called it a racist circle of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts were referring to a greater problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and wrote about it, for example, the ét The Verge and Mother Day after Snapchat told me that he had removed the filter.
The author gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be the ring of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes of stereotypes.
Part of the argument was a nice anime comparison.
In his e-mail, a Latin American art student named Grace Spapanani, who was widely distributed in the images, said that the lens was "at least insulting and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the paralleling of a highly flavoured Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface" but is taken to a despicable understanding."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In an American culture, it is likely that there will be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from the governments of companies to Hollywood and the devices that we carry with us.
The public of Snapchat is composed of young people who are more ethnicly diverse than their parents' contributions, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more rationality.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, things like this will no longer be easily ignored as before," said a 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as manufacturer and designer in the Media Publication Platform, decided to delete its Snapchat account on Thursday and to encourage others to do the same.
In his medium-term article and phone interview, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of respect for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the company's majority board of directors, mostly white and exclusively male, and decided to write on a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is true that in their unilateral staff there are no colourful people in which they can make decisions of this kind, or they have a colour as employees, but their position is not that they dare to express their views directly and easily" says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely ignored the claim.
The company does not publish the figures on the ethnic background of its staff, relying on its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but its informant said that the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and promoting participation within the company.
Zhu, for its part, says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK."
According to the congressional expert report, military officials distorted their intelligence on ISIS.
On Thursday, the Congress Group of Experts published a report stating that the US armed forces, Central Command, were amending intelligence reports in order to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than the events in the field gave rise to understanding.
The Republican presidents of the Sub-Committee on Budgets and Budgets of the United States Committee of America established a working group to discuss the "general dissatisfaction" of military analysts. Analyses suggest that the superior military officers have been evaluated against the US action against Isis.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the US Armed Forces headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for transit operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence received by the Supreme Directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorist activities than the facts indicated in the field, and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other services in the Commonwealth," is reported in the press release on the report.
"Centcom events are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are found to high-level political decision-makers," says Ken Calvert, Republican Representative of California.
"The mistakes of Centcom's board of directors extend to the highest level of the organisation."
A 10-page report on the scope of the report describes in detail the further problems that occurred between 2014 and 2015 in relation to the description and analysis of Central Command's actions for training Iraqi troops in the US.
Although the report does not contain any decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama Administration have been faked, it gives a picture of the analysts, which suggests that the Centcom leaders would have put pressure on them to take a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, opinions and testimony to the Congress were much more positive than the events were really happening," the report says.
"For example, Centcom's official issued a public statement stating that a major military attack to reinstate Mosul could take place in April or May 2015.";
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. military chiefs of intelligence manipulated the intelligence received in order to minimize Isis' threat in Iraq."
The Republics set up a task force after finding out about the doubts put forward by the investigators that intelligence on human beings has been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the investigations will continue to continue.
The Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector General has launched a Centcom intelligence investigation.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Committee of the Committee of the Presidents for Inquiry made their own findings, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Bureau.
"Centcom, between 2014 and 2015, created an excessively restricted process in which intelligence on the security forces of Iceland and Iraq was evaluated," says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democratic representative of the Committee, says Adam B. Schiff.
According to Schiff, this article "suspended the publication of intelligence results, "infringed the morals of analysts" and "not enough to take into account different views".
However, according to Schift and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to the "pre-defined or political official line".
On Tuesday, the Daily Beast newssite told us about the preliminary findings of a study conducted by the Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation of the Pentagon's chief inspector, who started following appeals by Centcom's analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant-commander, Patrick Evans, in his information, says that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the report of the FCI as long as the investigation of the inspector is ongoing.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the DCI and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
There are other consequences in the investigation, apart from trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (one of the arguments put forward by the Defence Authority).
However, the arguments put forward last year raised doubts as to how much President Obama can count on the Central Command and how it can give honest estimates of the war operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of father-to-father intelligence responds to differences that occurred over a decade ago when Centcom’s intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which President George W. Bush’s government, despite the protests of many of the investigators, supported only small troops in Iraq and took little time to consider the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hoker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence about the people involved.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Working Party concluded that, despite the contrary public statements, air strikes at the refineries in Isis had not significantly undermined the team's economy because it had built temporary processing plants and was able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the investigation were not transmitted outside Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critical last year after many legislators had estimated that the statements of testimony given to him were too positive to estimate war.
General Austin retired in April, and in his place, General Joseph L. Votel, the King of the Central Command, was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will end the fourth duel on the ground hockey of women and establish its position in an inter-agency settlement with the United Kingdom.
After taking three goals in victory, I scored 6-1 in the resolution game against Japan against Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in one game could be considered a great achievement, but Bam, 27-year-old, wasn't sure if he ever succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who count on the paintings they do."
However, he knows that the Americans have won four games in their Olympics and lost a zero game and share in their group first with the United Kingdom, which continued its winning streak when winning on Thursday, Japan's 2-0 chapters on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play opposite Saturday at the last round of the first round.
Each team survived the final match, which determines which of them will be the first and second of the six teams.
The first is to avoid meeting for a longer time with a tough Dutch team that won the second copy.
Despite what happens at Saturday’s game, the Americans have already raised their surprise success in these games four years after it was the last 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team too in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvan State, and for the first time in the country, he was infected at the age of three (his older twins played in Drexel). He was in the country team at the age of 16 and was the youngest national team member of all ages.
The 2008 Olympics missed out when they failed to cope with the final player list.
After that, 2012 has been the year where you and his team did not have much success.
The following year the coach was appointed as English Craig Parnham, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London was not as it is now in London.
We have made a complete translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the paint shop during the first half of the night by hitting the ball near the crucifixion in.
India had entered the game without any tournament victory, but it turned out to be a rather tough opponent and lasted 1-0 up to the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field, twisted into the middle, hit the goal of the ball, and thus took the Americans 2 to 0 to the top.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first tournament in which US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the score empty. In the first three games, the American goal had been sunk in each one hit.
Briggs is now living his career of success,
Like bam.
"Our location is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the game.
In the middle of the Olympic Hull, in the middle of the trampoline, that zeni.
Regardless of the time and time, the Olympics will inevitably be hit by an attack.
The events, competitions and struggles of Rio de Janeiro seem to be following with passion the message all the time and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympics themselves were a flaming commotion that moves from a bow to a swimmer, a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor in a coffee shop line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Closes.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time the Dooley charms of the Olympics with their hearts and might well be the name on the lips of everyone who would see and be part of the best viewing and listening time, would be popular for sponsors and would appear in TV advertising if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordman.
Dooley, from the California Lake Forest, 28th, competes from the Olympics on trampolin.
The Olympics are not equally illuminating all competitions.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow are less known sports types, such as air-spraying, bowing, balling and taekwondo.
We're always going to have a twilight, and we're going to have to have a championship for a long time.
But if I may be allowed to write a simple story about my own special preference, I would like to draw attention to the secluded charm of trampoliin.
Although trampoline has been the Olympics since the 2000s, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was the Olympics.
Ignorance can be regional.
Of course, from the United States, athletes have participated in Olympic trampoline, but the country has never been able to reach medals or to go to finals until 2012.
In the trampolis of men, medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the female side, the medallion is divided into two Canadians.
China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLenna are defending this year the gold medals they won in London.
However, Trampolis has the charm of a low-level man, partly because, in the uncivilized way, it sounds more appropriate to a circus school than to an Olympic.
(In this context, I feel that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species have their cumulative potential, which is used in drawing diagrams for infinitely endless extremism scenes, but they also have the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. for species that are inherently linked in trampolis.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "flight board".
The ambitious masters will jump with a huge trampoline that will send them to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing on their feet, jumpers will have to make a series of acrobat movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympics program, jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty rate and "flight time".
32 athletes coming from 17 different countries from 16 and 16 of them are men and 16 of them are women.
The trend towards the most common Olympic species is straight ahead.
The medalheads must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across a line, sometimes back and forth around the field, in pursuit of gold.
In addition to the floor or the wall of origin, they also have a second objective to aim for world or Olympic recording in television-based reporting instruments, in particular World or Olympics.
This determined goal is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough even to bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting just in front of the competitions.
This trampoline provides a resting rest period.
The trampolis direction is upwards.
The aim is not to move forward.
The gymnast climbs up weightless as an astronaut, falls down and flaming back up.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not involve intense rushing to paint or jumping far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close as the Olympics can be.
Women's fights and finals will be held this afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men's corresponding competitions will begin on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals half an afternoon to its transmission, which will begin on either day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of the Olympics, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the middle of a common huddle.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering and objectifying male athletes who are attracted to the audience – as the United States Men’s Forcers Wall Street Journal recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his brand-new fan group to look at.
An entire generation of protests in Ethiopia, which is the United States' long-term ally.
Violent protests in Ethiopia.
Government forces have violently broken down political demonstrations calling for change throughout Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in conjunction with the police.
Is Ethiopia in a state of disintegration?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a good West ally, the economy of which has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaking anti-governmental demonstrations that are spreading to more and more areas.
Just last year, thousands of people were rushing to the streets, demanding profound political change.
According to civil society organisations, the reaction of the government was ruthless.
According to the witnesses, the police shot and killed a number of unarmed protestors.
Thoughts are supposed to be in the videos at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, showing how the security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand up against the wall at the hands of the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"To keep the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa, whose stability has been established by the Nordic countries, following Nigeria.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are very close to the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, will receive this much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, and the capital of Addis Ababa is still a new urban port train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the model of democracy. Human rights organisations have always reported government repression policy, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
Things can change.
"If the people are repressed, and there is no other choice but to explain their minds, it will come out," says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer working in Central Ethiopia.
"The whole person agrees with the whole person.
A whole generation of protests."
There are many reasons for dissatisfaction, always using land to control the rule of the government coalition.
The ruling party and its allies, which were widely criticised last year after last year's high-crisis elections, received a position in each of the opposition's former positions, resulting in their now ruling over the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the border with Eritrea, where the protracted situation required hundreds of victims of death in the fight that took place in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Emancipation Strangle or the Ogaden Emancipation Army, may seek to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been reaching under the surface for years now is falling apart.
The first one is manifestly innocent: smartphones.
Just over the last few years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media when more affordable smartphones became common and the Internet became more accessible.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people access the internet via brokers hiding their location.
Many Ethiopians told me that this is what they called people for demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of people in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhares, between the two largest groups of the population of Ethiopia.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
Amharas, mainly from the high Christendom, have long been controlling the country's politics and business and taking out organ, most of which are Muslims and living in the Netherlands.
This, too, is changing.
"The joint work is deepening and we are coming under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Director-General of Oromo.
The main demonstrations have been just in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many large and oroms experience the unfair control of Ethiopia by the Tigrh tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and, however, controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of restlessness is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former Rebel Director-General Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until he died of an unrivalled disease by name in 2012.
He was considered to be a tactical genius who could see the angle behind him.
Analysts indicate that he was particularly capable of detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using the ambassadors who agreed between the counterparties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says Controversy Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, from the northern Ethiopia region of Tigrén, Hailemam comes from the south.
Analysts indicate that he does not have the trust of the security forces managed by the Tigre family.
Many people fear this means more bleeding.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands of protests against the elections that the government, according to the analysts, first broke down and then stole.
In post-election restlessness, many protesters were killed, although the number of deaths was smaller than in the previous month, and the restlessness ceased relatively quickly.
Developmental experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their far-reaching infrastructure planning, such as the new urban trains, and their significant progress in combating poverty.
But the internal resentment to the government of Ethiopia has certainly not prevented the reinforcement.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
In the last month, protestors in Gondari attacked companies owned by tigers, and the hatred of tigers is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts indicate that protests put the United States and other Western allies at risk.
The United States Government has used Ethiopia as a base for the unmanned, foreign aircraft monitoring Somalia, but according to the United States, the base has recently closed.
While, at the same time, he clearly wants to support democracy, he also does not want to see a commoner in an unstable region collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says that he was sarcastic in claiming that Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in the last dispute that hit his campaign, claiming that he was not seriously claiming several times this week by President Obama and Hillary Clinton's terrorist group Isis as the "founders" of Isis.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate for presidential election to send a clear message to the citizens of his country.
There are also his supporters who have to try and stand up for defence at these momentous times and explain the comments he may not have meant to make.
Trump put forward a statement at a meeting on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he argued that the President and Hillary Clinton had created Isis.
However, early on Friday morning Lomp Twitch Twitched and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump totally turned on the day before his speech when I told him that he had been accused of several interviews.
When the radio broadcaster and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trums soften their claim by saying that Obamahan is trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to refuse his claim.
The latest shock came when Trump tried to focus his campaign on return to the economy in the light of the fall in support figures.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy dialogue in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
He warned her that Clinton's proposals would increase taxes and felt that Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has been sued in a corner of the past.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to call upon the browns to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was being sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and draws his words back if necessary.
"I believe that this is his way of testing certain messages that will respond to his supporters. He considers how the supporters react to messages and "to clarify" whether in one way or another depending on the reaction," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by each of the presidents.
"But I also believe that he understands his argument and knows that they are sufficiently round to pass through different screenings."
Instead of softening his opinions to the electoral community, Trump has recently made his style even more sensitive, as his support numbers have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist revealed that Trump's support is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado than in Florida, while the situation is quite even.
While Trump usually tries to try to apologize for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being subject to more and more attention, the Presidential campaign in the last months has been put his faithful supporters in an awkward position, in which they publicly defend the comments of the Trump, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of the most significant supporters, the former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, strongly defended the presidential candidate at the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I regard his word as a reasoned, political speech," answered Giuliani when he was asked if Trump was right to claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isis.
"It is true that before Obama Isis was almost an unknown, small organization, which Obama called completely wrongly "the lower set of teams" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
The majority of the Republics representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Minister for Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue to do so when it did not take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before this Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media in a search for where he accused them of dissenting and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He made fun of the "incompetent and pathetic" media commentators who try to find out about him, but he says that they can't succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only prove more clearly that he was not fit for president.
Due to the rise in excessive rent, a coffee shop that has stopped at Greenpoint opens its doors because of an increase in the number of reasonable rents.
Verb Cafe was a little dirty coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was available for payment, where there was no Wi-Fi, but who offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe got charged out of its streettop at Bedford Avenue when the rent became disproportionate.
Verb Cafe replaced in the summer of 2014 Soap Cerie, who came in, sells soaps in the form of cakes.
The locals consider that the loss of a cafe which has been put away by mid-classification is a matter of pity.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote: "New York is, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is no longer in existence, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
Even though New York is no longer yet, new ones will also be created there.
Last November Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original place.
The new Verb coffee has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still inconclusive.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee shop.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very excited to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb mode bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espresso model.
In addition, it reintroduced old Verb's stamps.
Rodriguez says that, however, he was trying to try something new and something new.
added new products to the list.
Bacon chicken egg- cheese-sandwiches are available and must be filled with caps and browned onions.
There are also Tumbers on the list.
Coffee is no longer available for beer, but instead fresh fruit juices are made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of coffee, Rodriguez says that he has discovered that the old regular customers have started to visit Verb in a steady stream.
"And many of our old customers got priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly living in Williamsburg and visiting Verb regularly.
After returning to Greenpoint, he made walking trips to Verbi, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized my favorite thing about Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took instead of his usual ice coffee, a chai-them, which is also a listing extract.
Tom Rosen, a new long-term customer, was faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and, without exception, ordered the same thing.
"I entered the coffee shop every day at over seven o'clock like a machine, and there they already prepared my lobage with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also tried to try something new and brought new products to his food list.
Today, Roundthal continues to use its standard products, but on occasion, he is making his bagels with bacon, eggs, eggs and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says that there is no resentment over the fact that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cheri offered to even produce a special soup used in the production of Verb’s own cold-frozen coffee.
"We may take the offer again", says Rodriguez.
Polish people who have lived in Greenpoint, also, have welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu upside down, and Rodriguez now tells us that he's looking for a suitable place for his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and make the coffee shop cold-rolled coffee.
The café may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he reports that his heart was broken when the cafe was shut down.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, says Whitt.
"I smelled like coffee."
The hard food of the great depression in a new work: A square meal.
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delno Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House for lunch.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary, was pleased with the general dishes of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose-paying apricot and Maryland’s turtle soup.
On that day, his dinner was more modest: devil eggs (lighted eggs) in tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from plum pie.
"It was a sign of colinar solidarity for people suffering," says Jane Zigelma.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message for the Americans how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights work for each of them as a home historian.
The last book of Coe, called the Chop Suey, describes the Chinese cuisine in America, while the last book of Zigelman, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the story of the building in the Lower East Side, through food.
Their new joint venture is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food in the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple awarded their own culinary solidarity in agreement with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar in the vicinity of the Flatiron pilot and was opened in the same year as the big stock market collapse took place, in 1929.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and an olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potato and mixed hate.
When the editor ordered meat pastry, the couple said it would be appropriate to have a very large depression to eat for discussion.
"The concerns were very popular," says Jane Zigelman.
"Man eats peanuts, livers and beans.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine your cancer with so many peanuts that they are sufficient for the whole meal."
What do you mean?
"It must have weighed in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession years, the American table, especially in the countryside, was operating under the buffet principle, "eating as much as you want."
Women were working for agricultural workers, and counter-flavoured pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans had just sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a stubborn way of survival when suddenly the crowd was abandoned.
"This was the time when food became the central and exciting subject of American talk," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same agitating was a new affordable diet: according to Zigelman, mysterious dishes such as desserts and pot foods became the main food, and the potion food was called "a great way to use the food stars" because the cooks could not cover up such attractive materials with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the most important part of the American meal, became the most discreetly used luxury.
Strange mixes were tried, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values, and not so much taste or even a healthy food supply.
When conducting a study for a book, which also includes recipes, Jane Zigelman prepared ground-breaked oven powders filled with groundnuts used as a low-time food.
"It did not get popularity at dinner," says Coe, where Coe, says.
Zigelman adds: "It's not real.
Groundnuts and ovens are not compatible at all with each other.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Home Office between 1923 and 1943, controlled citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encourage women to become well-known budget holders and respond to the challenge of making delicious dishes of carrot-to-currant-to-currant-to-currant-to-be-currant-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toe-toy-toe-toy-toy-toy-toy-toy-toy dishes.
The A Square Meal book is a festival of historical flavors.
Specially tasty are reports on the reaction of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Give me my Food Cake" position.
While publicly praiseing his children for their simple food on an iowa farm, he himself, as a millionaire and sophisticated gentleman as he had become.
"He liked continental European kitchens, such as fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He can be found in the dining room, on top of the tuxedo.
"He was completely pleased with the reality."
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to look at him at the spot.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the dishes served in the White House were not only the boring ones in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the feedings of depression were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
According to Jane Zigelman, the survival of tradition continues to work on how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has applied to cooking.
The couple’s account in writing a book that began to understand better the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother, for example, why she couldn’t throw food away.
"He was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away," said Coe.
"Man even began to feel sick about his food," recalls Zigelma.
"For one thing, first of all, the limp hats."
After the main food plates were decompressed at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Zigelma and Coe took out the post-street food they produced at home, the same as Mr. Roosevelt at lunchtime.
"It's called a snowflake," says Zigelma and adds that giving the appearance of a name to the modest receptacles was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We threw our spoons up against the thick brown owl.
Surprisingly, it didn't look bad at all.
Coe was your second and third song.
"The Germans would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget holder.
Gilead is fully covered by the legal fees for the patents of the hepatitis C medicinal product with Merck.
The Court of Justice of the United States of America ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees incurred by it in connection with the legal dispute with Merck & Co Inc about the patent of the hepatitis C medicinal product with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars of compensation for the infringement of two patents owned by the Merck in respect of successful medicines named Gilead Sovaldi and Haron. The US judge found that Merck committed offences involving the misdemeanor of the oath and other immoral practices.
In a complaint registered on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees that it was entitled to indict the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which manages the market with a new generation of anti-hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance of Gilead medicines.
United States-supported troops have taken over Manbij City of Isisi by the United States.
The United States-supported troops have taken over the town of Manjib, near the Turkish border of northern Syria, when the last factions of Isisi's opponents have left the country, reports the officer of the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now in a position to find the city by the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
SDF, representative of the Manbij Military Council, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by Isis fighters have been released.
"We've got the whole town now," said Darwish. "But we're still doing search operations."
Clintons earned USD 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
On Friday, President-elect Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax return, which shows that his income and that of his husband at that time amounted to $10,75 million and the total tax rate of the federal state they paid at that time was 34,2 %.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, the largest part of the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $ 5.3 million in talks, and Hillary Clinton, former Foreign Minister, announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's audience, a book that dealt with his post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President's Association of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, published the 10-year tax notices.
The total tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20,3%.
"Hillry Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to demonstrate economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in his newsletter.
The complete contrast is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
As a rule, U.S. presidential candidates have always published their tax information, even though it is not required of them by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have called on the tax administration to check and state it as the reason why Trump has not published his income data.
"Sirto is yours" was Twitched by Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the statutory tax information.
On Thursday, senior attorney Michael Cohen told the CNN that he would not let Trump disclose his tax information until the checks have been completed.
The more competitive critics, including Mitt Romene, President of the Republican Presidential Committee of 2012, and other members of the Republic, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his grants to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and published a online video on Friday, bringing out prominent Republicans who will reveal their true tax information to the public.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his economic debate in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what each candidate for president has been doing for decades, and not to publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid just a little from two in the 1990s, and the New York Times' business report quoted this Friday several tax advisors and auditors that the situation may still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become the main issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named by billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that over a million dollars a year earn at least 30 % of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton Conference held in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose head office is located in the same place as the Berkshire Hathaway tripartite company, challenged at a meeting in Trump where they would disclose their tax data.
Buffet tells us that he has also been subject to the control of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons currently living in Chappaqua, New York State, taxed on average 32% of the true federal tax in 2007-2014 and the actual combined tax rate paid by them was about 40.5%.
The tax return of Clintons in 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their incomes were wage contributions.
Their main investment was a de minimis index investment fund, and Clintons reported the amount of interest and interest income at $100,000.

In order to support the protection of elephants by sandeel-filled carnations in Tanzania, the Commission has decided to amend this Regulation in accordance with the principles set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
Naturalists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the habitat – elephants are rushed to throw in condoms filled with chili powder towards them.
The work has proved to be effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with a few years ago, has, together with the US Nature Conservancy, started a campaign to teach volunteers from the villages of Northern Denmark how to protect their people, without harming the elephants of their homes and cultures.
Some time ago, spears were used for elephant alerting.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen attitudes change in these villages, for now the villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without harming them," says the CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation, Damian Bell, in his press release.
First, the invading elephant is alarmed by showing a flashlight and staring at the horn.
If this doesn't work, the so-called chili cloud will be thrown.
The compounded chili powder is placed in a condom together with a heel, and then the head of the condom is wrapped around the head in such a way that only the fuse is left out.
When the ignition switch is lit, the condom blows open and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last way to do that is to shoot a fireman who is known as a Roman candle in the air and to create a loud and clear explosion.
The Jewish film director criticised the berlin hotel for removing Israel's orientation from the Arab "hospital" – RT News.
A French, mostly Jewish film director gave birth to the mediaraiv once he revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's destination number in its country number list.
Laude Lanzmann, author of the Shoh document on holocaust, deported to the Berlin Kampinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the guide list provided by the hotel.
However, it is not among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Bristol Bristol provides the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that he was shocked by the response of the reception officer.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was "the very carefully-informed decision of the two hotels".
The reason behind this was the film director still upset.
According to Lanzman, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's destination."
The German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman of Israel, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said that the case was "a great pity.
"The habit of shocking and shocking us all.
It's a big shame.
And the more disgraceful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No further explanation is required.
We are waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions", says the Ambassador.
The incident caused a real counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kampinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of alleged Arabic customers.
A publication that revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue.
Der Spiegel writes about the hotel's contested charges as soon as possible, invited the hotel to make a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the destination list was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Kampinski Hotel, says.
This adds that the destination number has been added to the list since.
Cops used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students.
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they came together to comment on the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The lockout began when law enforcement tried to blow up a bunch of students, which resulted in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students were involved in the demonstration, who wanted to show their disapproval of government plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paulo has proposed a saving measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some protestors made graffitis for walls where the opposition to Michel Temeri, the presidential officer, was found to be against them.
The student demonstration only took place a few days after the streets were filled with dissented protestors of President Dáll Roussef, who were in favour of the protestors, the country, in the vote on this point in question.
Country-Iran trade has increased by 71 % – RT -RT
Annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 7.9% since the departure of the packages, reports the Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Djhagarya.
According to him, the interest of foreign companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were imposed.
"Vehicles continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further development of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Djhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 7.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly to 91.5%, to $697 million.
Imports from the Russian imports increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was fueled by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects the record number of Iranian journalists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Service in Iran issued some 35,000 visas for Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries to which the citizens visited Russia.
It is not too dangerous to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, in turn, is relatively small, which ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend that you stay in the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
The Scottish Callum Skinner scored when the Brits won the bike gold.
Scotland’s Callum Skinner called out to the famous men in the team print with the Rio’s veldom last night, when the British Trio defended the title earned in London in 2012.
Glasgowian 23-year-old Skinner was the anchor he inherited from his country from a Scottish Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made a legend proud of his praise for the goal and winning the New Zealand team as the pre-requisite.
The UK took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had settled until the sixth in March in the World Cups of Cycling in London, London, despite Hoy’s subsequent abandonment of his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff specialising in the role of the first leader.
Hines showed up just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his career was also left behind the opening that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill in.
Scottish Skinner was the man that the British coach believed and where they saw the potential that he has redeemed now.
Hines, Hoy and the winner of the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British Trio won gold in the duel.
Hines was almost behind his tour, but Kenny was working on the team's lead, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was planned to be made in such a way that Hines drove the speed down at a higher speed, which enabled Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up with the speed.
Hoy followed the BBC's comment and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hines' eyes when they stood up for the prize.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered from the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and success.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world's masters.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to overcome it."
After winning London in 2012, Hines, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had accidentally fallen on the track because of a bad departure.
He later withdrew his words, and the British competitor did not have an appeal.
This time, there were no such problems with the sovereign victory.
He says, "I felt like London, all the British flags were flying in the audience.
Our team was united over the last three months.
We've lost so many world universes that victory at the Olympics seems great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of tenrats in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress made over the past five months, then the five days ahead will be a success.
As Kenny has shown in his powers, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold at some Olympics.
This would mean drawing up an account on six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years older than Hoyt and also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
At the same time, the public contributions would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is at a spritzer starting today and solving in three days' time.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says: "At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
Enjoy the victory together with a friend.
It's too lonely to win one."
He says, "If he wins another two grand medals, he must have the knight's dignity."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four men on the team run.
Their time was 3:51. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The world record made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.69.
The first round and final (at 22.42 p.m.) will be competitive today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition authorities before the time period when the operators invited him to hit the lengths.
The women’s competition, which ends and ends tomorrow, in Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald, from Milgavi, reached World Recording Time 4:1.2.260.
The British team can now count on its mighty team of bikes to take responsibility for the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence obtained from total leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which do not have the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of the arguments of sex and bullying, and the end of the competitions of large athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, competition on the first occasion on the subject shows that the original reputation of the United Kingdom is already coming to the top once again at the moment.
The future future future of Portland's melting future of Portland will be at stake as a result of the end of the electricity agreement.
The future of the aluminium ceiling in the state of Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers, are at stake when the power company operating at the plant's electricity, said that one of the plant's owners was about to close the delivery contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts would be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Government of Victoria earlier this year not to continue to grant aid to which the plant is operating.
The flat-rate 20-year support will cease in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are likely to be lost at the Alcoan Portland factory.
As a result of suspensions, even 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowflow impact can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes around 10 % of the total electricity generation in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the start of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland melting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with the manufacturer’s plans for the future of the years, which were first caused by the price of production in Australia’s strong dollar and in the newest factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large installation of its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other owners of the plant to terminate their contract.
The majority owner is Alcoa and Alumina Joint Undertaking. Chinese CITIC and Marubeni Corp, Japan, owns minority shares of the factory.
AGL says that it expects Portland production plant to survive, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant continues.
AGL states that contracts are so-called protection contracts which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contractual termination period is 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in 2017", says the plant.
The potential impact on profits for AGL from 2018 to 2018 is currently limiting the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million "as a pre-emption for the conclusion of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements "has no effect on Alcoa ... capacity to keep the fuser in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the fuser.
The US firm reported that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, even though it still needs to find out why it has now been cancelled.
In view of the poor economic situation, analysts have been cautious about their assessment of both the plant in the state of Victoria, in Portland, and the plant in Tomago, located close to Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, Executive Director of AGL, told the analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts of electricity at annual level.
"If these factories leave the market, that means a significant drop in demand (in the market) in the market.
As a producer, it would not be good news for us," says Mikkelen.
Kardashianit-to-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-tho-too Kendall as Vogue cover girl of September's Vogue Vogue.
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, 20 poses in the famous September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, which is the commercial face of Estee Luder and has appeared in the fashion calendars of Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at a room full of people I love," Kendall wrote.
The release of the film was followed by a strange (or perhaps only only with respect to the Kardashianit series?), a written video, with all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barbs Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite friend, Kardashinit, producer of the Kardashinit programme, Ryan Seacrest) writing a picture of his brother's scene. The film was a classic version: they were all in the world of surprise.
The plot is cliche, and it is used in almost all the April events (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get the rest of his daughters involved in this publicity in any way.
The presence of the Vogue in the September issue will undoubtedly mean a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall's great sister Kim was able to reach Vogue before (he appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is just in its own category.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold publication per year.
A large number of advertisers are attracted to a large number of image books of a thickness greater than that of a fashion magazine (the fashion site Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of ads at the 832-page op last year).
The cover of the September issue is so eagerly expected that in the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public even before they are officially announced.
Previous September’s cover models have been: Naomi Campbell, Linda Evange and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more famous people working better than models that are famous.
The award-winning and Dior-promos múto - Lawrence was featured in 2013 and the year later Lady Gaga was honoured.
The magazine described Jenner as a success for his generation, and even if he is more involved in the reputations of the better working, he is still very well with him.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, true-tv stars or children of modern age who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be described as talented women who succeed in the field of entertainment over others.
Last year's Beyonce in the cover photo has one of the strongest years of his career, when he created his Lemonde album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Due to its true-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be hapless.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, judged Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadidi, by calling them "shits."
These emotions have re-arranged to the surface as the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue deck appeared.
However, continuing dissatisfaction seems immaterial.
Kendall Jenner is a cover image of the Vogue's September issue.
He's a superstitious, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking in the fashion fairs at Marc Jacobs.
He's the promotional field of Estee Lader's artificial goals.
He and all his people are selling pictures for themselves through pay-per-view applications.
He's selling a picture of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he shot on the L.I.E. page.
And at his leisure, he's on real TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal Aid Centres turn away 160,000 people a year.
The 160,000 most vulnerable people per year are turned away from the Justice Aid Centres and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts of appropriations will have on the centres already operating at an extremism.
In the Land of Queensland, three of the five applicants for legal aid and legal services are already being decommissioned – most of them are old people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustifiable convictions and similar injustice without the resources of those fighting.
Public legal aid services, which are already under strain, prepare for additional cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are still at risk of losing 30% more of the federal financing.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, tells us that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of the Office for Legal Aid, thousands of people are being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says that the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centres are always underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away when they seek the necessary services they need,” Farrell says.
"The people who leave foreign relations, the people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, the families in existence, the workers who are unduly fired – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandi, in order to give up these financial operations immediately so that people can obtain legal assistance in their country of origin.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitments to bring legal aid to the national average level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of the public legal aid centres and their municipalities, and the Government of Palaszczu must invest in this important work."
An action against Donald Tõmp's campaign was brought against the threat of the worker by means of a weapon.
New York: A complaint was brought against Donald Trump’s campaign when no action was supposed to be taken after the chairman was told that the director of the North Carolina campaign had been injured by a worker while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event will be described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, former software trainer of the state campaign, at the court of the state court on Wednesday in Charlotte.
Bordini says that he has waited months for the situation to be dealt with within the campaign, before he understands, according to his own words, that this will not happen.
Bordini, in his complaint, says that CEO Dr. Phillip "suppressed a gun, put his right first finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe into the Vincentian kneecap."
Following a complaint to the local and regional director of the campaign, Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Although you do not launch a weapon, it will cause harm," says Bordin in his action.
The action will only be brought two days after the presidential candidate of the Republican Republican Union is generally angry in saying to the people in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second paragraph" – which are held by gunmen and armed forces – may take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to the most senior campaign staff, the media released his words from their context, and Trump did not speak out as an incentive to violence.
Bordini claims that the campaign should be compensated for the lack of interest and for Phillip's compensation for the assault, assault and mental suffering caused by it.
Hope Hicks, a senior informant, did not immediately respond to the message in which he was asked to comment.
Mr. Phillip was not sought despite attempts to do so.
The local press office of Charlotte WCCB reported that Phillip left the campaign behind.
No immediate response was received to the call submitted to Phillip's consultation attempt, the Innovative Consulting Services, for which Phillip's call was submitted.
Donald Trump, President-elect of the Republics, has been a controversial campaign.

The UK must use the Olympic Heathrow expansion as an opportunity for the UK to use an increase in Heathrow.
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates well-being — not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
This was the thing that most interested me most in Heathrow, as at the Summer Olympics in London 2012 we made a huge effort to ensure that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10 000 new entrants and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates unemployment in nearby areas of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who feel that the Heathrow extension is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in a awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
Possible obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer any question heathrow has asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits a lot instead of a few.
The extension will be possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the airport environment and to the whole of the United Kingdom.
At Heathrow, we have a great task force that has been running in time and remaining in the budget a EUR 11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included the T5 terminal – voted for the best airport terminal in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal that was built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
They are now ready to build the third runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic objective for Heathrow's expansion, so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Government of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook adstenston in cat-mouse games.
The efforts of companies that earn money from the online advertising industry to distract advertising media software have been transformed into cat-mouse cuts, says one company that produces blocking programmes.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block the adstensto programs, Adblock Plus published a blog, where it told us that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent social service advertisements.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes for advertising on its website, making it more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's found out the new codes.
Ben Williams, an Adblock informant in his blog book, wrote that "this kind of gadget between the open-source advertising community and the distractions has been running since the invention of the advertisement test" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be doing its own repair shop again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the battle is a strong indication of how much concern the advertisers have become in the sector.
On a global scale, around 200 million people are using advertising media programmes, reports Pagefair and Adobe’s last year’s study, which has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile phones daily, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to focus on misleading advertising promotional programmes in its desktop application, as, according to the informant, mobile promotional prevention programmes do not work on Facebook mobile apps and apps.
The revenue from the decktop advertisements is still sufficiently high and Facebook considered the investment to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it was up to the user settings advertising tool to allow users to better control how advertisements are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters because it also prevents the appearance of some of the normal Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for the user, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook informant in his email address.
"Advertising programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and that is why we have invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools, so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving her under the cars on a Swiss motorcycle.
The victim lay on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway for the accident that occurred during the first hours of Thursday, where the woman was deliberately left under a vehicle.
The accident occurred on the A1 engine in the Vaudi canteen near Yoges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate job by standing on the dark road, and more cars hit her, reports Vaudi's police informing her.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear attempt to commit suicide. Among the overrun cars was also a truck.
A woman was killed at the scene of the accident.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified.
In Le Tribune de Geneve, the lawyer Gilles Hofstter, the lawyer, says that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in the accident are being raised.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It will remain with the D.A.', says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases of non-responsibility for car drivers.
According to the newspaper, in either case, a person walked on a dark motorcycle and the right decided that drivers could not wait for him to come across and meet his traveler on a highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was set up for charges against him for the death penalty following a man who was lying on the A1 engine near Paynerne on the night of August 2014 in the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had enjoyed plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court found that the driving pattern of the police — which was responsible for the emergency — was justified and that the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unexpected situation.
Any news of an accident near Morges on Thursday is requested to call the police at 0 21 644 83 46 or 0 21 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable.
According to the estimates of the new climate, Venus may have been viable.
The SAS' Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model for examining the past of Venus with the same tools and algorithms as the climate researchers are using.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus could have been similar to those on earth at times, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide-free.
Previous submissions by researchers indicate that Venus' slow speed of rotation is reflected in its thick gas circuit.
However, on the basis of the most recent simulations, it may be assumed that Vent has had a thin, earth-equivalent atmosphere, and it has, however, been wrong.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were likely to be more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been sufficient water and geographical variations to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% lower than the sun.
"In GISS' model, Venus spins slowly, and its date is nearly two months from the sun," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in his press release.
This warms the surface and creates a rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts as an umbrella and largely protects the surface from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperature.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
While Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and UV light for several billions of years.
Its oceans faded, and the UV light burned steamed water.
With hydrogen running into space, all that remains is a thick carbon-rich atmosphere and a fatal greenhouse effect – that is, Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported on the creation of a new Venus climate simulation in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy will give up on his part as a coach at Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned as the coach of the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday and vice-president of the club’s hockey operations, claiming lack of potential for the team’s decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice-President and Vice-President of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the follow-up would start immediately to apply for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have worked as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice-president of the hockey activities of the Society with a strong, passionate and determined mind", says 50-year-old Roy.
"I have thought long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to higher levels during the summer.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of Coach and Association’s hockey activities must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have authority in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled."
Sakic, who paid Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish it all good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the last year for his first period as Head Coach of Avalanche in 2013–2014.
Under his direction, the company reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in landing games and has not arrived for the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 points between 2015 and 2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card in the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame Governor Roy won in his career four Stanley Cups — two in the lines of the Montreal Canadiens and two in the rows of Avalanche.
Oil workers from the North Sea will start negotiations and stop the strike.
The Prime Ministers-General shall inform the North Sea oil workers of the interruption of wages when all parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which offers oil service services, has been held in the hands of drilling trucks in the North Sea, under the control of Royal Dutch Shell, located in Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, 'Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will be attending several day-to-day meetings over the next few weeks to discuss the problems of recent considerations.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which, according to them, was the first over 25 years, as a protest to potential wage cuts of up to 30%.
Wood Group will cut the tariffs for its North Sea contractors this year by around 9% because of the pressure on the free market.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is responsible for calculating the prices of contractors working in the country by 10 per cent in 20114.
According to the company, the additional operations will give it the space needed to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, in turn, has cut off thousands of employees from his salary list and announced his plans to abandon oil and gas drilling activities in even 10 countries, thus aiming to improve its efficiency after its megafaction with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by the United Kingdom in June to leave the European Union create pressure for energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for the entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need a economy that has an advantage for many, not just for a few," says Anderson.
New plans for the North Sea Sea are expected to be spent less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, while around USD 7 billion has been spent in the last five years.
The Kepler is causing the star's speed of rotation in the Star of Plejads.
The most recent task of the Kepler Conference has been to measure the speed of rotation of the stars, which has helped to gather the stars so far in the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Plejat's constellation.
On the basis of the new data, it is possible to determine why the stars of the same star group are spinning at different speeds and how the cycles are linked to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with the results of other stars we will learn more about the importance of the relationship between weight and age and even about the history of its universe," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech University's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in the press release.
The star of Plejads is 445 light-years away from the earth.
A large number of stars were created about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just about to reach their adult age.
They are now spinning more than ever.
At the peak of the speed of rotation from the stars that are growing up, large quantities of stars are pouring out from the star.
These winds have a star-braining effect on their arrival through star-magnetic fields.
As the star gets older, its speed of rotation starts to slow down.
The kepler conducts every star speed of rotation by observing the time between the appearance of identifiable quarts (equivalent to the solar peaks) and the time between the appearance of identifiable quarts.
The latest listed speed data indicates that larger stars are moving slower than smaller stars.
The Rebull compares the star to the dancers – the larger ones are moving slower than the smaller ones.
"We see the Plejad's "dance" that the kerbs are typically larger, whereas the most common kerbs are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Starship of Plejads is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory that allows the characteristics of the stars to be compared to the speeds of rotation.
"The Starship of the Plejads provides a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both the younger and the older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information on how, why and why the stars slow down the speed of rotation and end their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Plejaja’s speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal magazine.
