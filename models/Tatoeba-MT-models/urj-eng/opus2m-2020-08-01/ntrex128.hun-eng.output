Members of the United Nations of the world are concerned that they will find themselves on the Muppet Show.
Each member of the National Assembly was shocked by the proposal to change their address to MWP (Man of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
The alarm came upon him, the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) would be more like the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title might make them a subject of laughter.
According to one member of the working party, his group is concerned that their new name will respond to the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
For the sake of our non-Wale readers: in Welsh, twp is the same as twp, and pwp is the same as kaka.
According to one of the members of the Phiid Party, the entire political group is "dissatisfied" and therefore proposes alternatives.
One of the Conservative Members said that his group "opened" to change his name, yet he noted that the MPP was just a jump from the Mäpet.
Here it is worth noting that the words "w" in the Wales language are quoted in the same way as the words "u" in the Yorkshire English, i.e. the MWP, expressed as "map".
The position of the United Nations Assembly Committee responsible for preparing the draft legislative act on the name change is as follows: "The final decision on the title of the members of the assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The 2017 Act governing the governance of Wales made it possible for the Wales Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the appointment of the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support from the Commission.
With regard to the address of the Members, the Commission prefers the address of the Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Member of the Wales Parliament) and its amendment to the WMP, but the public consultation has rather supported the alternative to the MP.
Members of Parliament will be presenting new and new alternatives, but the agreement will be rather difficult, which will cause a problem for the President of the United Nations, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on changes of name in the next few weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the assembly at other points, including the disqualification of Members and the structures of the Commission.
Members of the European Parliament will be able to make their final vote on the matter of their own title during the discussion of the draft legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the name of the country.
Citizens will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to "The Republic of South-East Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to make a point to the end of a series of decades of debate with the neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
In the past, he has pointed out that he has been supporting, in essence, territorial needs with the name of his northern neighbour, and has repeatedly complained about his EU and NATO admission applications.
The Macedonian President George Ivanov is opposed to the referendum on roll-calling and is therefore not taking part in it.
However, voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise to be made for their EU and NATO accession.
In a difficult situation in the Middle East, the bells of St. Martin have been silenced, as well as the bells of St. Martin.
“More importantly, as I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
- Now neither is any of them."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would still be understandable.
“ People now have different associations, ” he says.
- Bars are no longer the community day where people end on a day-to-day basis."
As for the stories, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not succeed in the hopes of leaders, “and in time they will be back to the same place where they started. ”
And the place of the churches, including, will be the property of a residential community which also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy housing in these buildings will be white-skinned,” he claims, and this will further rush the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that most of those who enter these houses would join the religious community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations, before Harlem grew up in the black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out of the village in the thirty years,
After having taken possession of a nearby black public.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the community led by Reverend JohnJohnson – the reverend is aware of the application of the Harlem shopping street, the 125th street of Black Street or the boycott of black goods against non-commercial owners who are not in a position to market black products.
In 1939 a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell game was built on the order of Reverend Johnson's community.
Reverend Johannes Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
In July, an expert who spoke the bell game said that this bell game was a "a cultural heritage", "an indispensable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first bell game in the world to be spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, became a major bell game of the Riverside Church.
MerriWeather states that St. Martin has not been given the place to replace anyone at St. Martin.
In St. Martin's recent months, a complex situation has broken down with the involvement of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved in part by the world leadership of the country and partly by the bishop's office.
The leadership body of the parókia, the Council of the Churches in July, appealed to the Bishop's Office in order to "responsible costs" to the Council, where the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors awarded by the Office.
Some members of the public complain about the lack of transparency in the office’s house.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old Californian boy while fishing for shrimp.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy during a cancer-fishing process in California on the opening day of the cancer season on Saturday.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach Beach at Encinitas at 7 p.m.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB TV channel in San George said that he was diving with his friends this morning about half an hour ago when he was aware that he was crying for a boy's help. Then he had more than just to help him climb out of the water.
At first, he thought that the boy was just excited because he got a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “He got it.
He got me!"
"His shoulder was torn off at the belly of his skull," Hamil listed what he saw when he got to the boy.
– I started to say to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water’, he added.
The boy was transported by airman to the Rady Children's Hospital in San George, where he is currently in critical condition.
The cape of the boy attacking the boy is not known.
As Superintendent Larry said to the press, a few days earlier sharks in the area have been detected, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casbald) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the period of investigation and for security reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Assbury's would expand in the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's expert would be able to compete with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with sellers and wholesalers from the hotel.
In the context of the decline in sales of fashion and household goods, as part of the decline in the UK supply market of $2.8 billion, the chain will carry out testing of large-sized pipettes in 11 stores across the country, and, if successful, these will also appear in new goods from next year to next year.
The strengthening of the pipe line is due to the fact that the stores are trying to fill up the shelf areas previously covered by televisions, microwave ovens and household articles in various ways.
Sainsbury's told me that it doubles its offer for 3000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it now offers for the first time.
But previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in a larger area on stands of brands such as Boots and similar goods, waiting for customers to buy.
The trade is also relaunching the Boutique make-up family, where most of the products are now vegan – these are now being sought by more and more young customers.
In addition to the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer, he also tested his appearance in two Saissbury's stores, one of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the other in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
With the spread of online purchases and the shift of food shopping habits towards small local trades, wholesalers need to make more efforts to attract customers.
According to the CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to the wholesale trade, as the trade chain is trying to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since he bought the two chains two years ago, in several hundreds of stores in Sainsbury's, he also opened Argos classes and a number of Habitas classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition will prove to be even more profitable.
The store trade has failed its previous attempt to scrape the care and pharmaceuticals industries.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of revenues from pharmaceutical classes operating in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born three years ago when Sainsbury's sold £125 million to Celesio, the company operating the 281-business pharmaceuticals business to Lloyd's bakery chain operator.
According to the retailer, Lloyds will play a part in the strategy, and in four shops it will offer a wider quality of luxury skin care products, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vishy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by changing the appearance of our pipers.
We have also hired skilled staff to help those who are interested in helping them with advice.
Our branding serves all needs, and the attractive environment and a convenient location provide a source of excitement that highlights the experience of purchasing to a new level."
Frying "depreciated" after Holly Willoughby has stopped the 11 million pound agreement.
The star of the Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, has left after Holly Willoughby TV has stopped from the 11 million important agreements on the life-style distribution business in order to focus on the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of the two peoples was previously compared to the Goo brand, which was quoted by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old programmer announced that he was out of town.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled the match out of the Star of Dragons’ Den, Peter S.A., when he left his promising, life-style company at the last minute – to focus on his very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
As a matter of fact, it was ‘distorted’ when, during a tense discussion on the origin of the Marlow (Buckinghamshire) of the Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, he announced that due to his new contracts of a total of GBP 1.5 million, there was no longer enough time left for their common brand, Truly, to sell domestic wear and accessories.
The two peoples’ business was compared to the Goop brand, quoted earlier by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it is expected that it would have doubled the estimated assets of Willoughby by £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, he traveled from the island to one of his homes.
According to one source: “The Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long term, and this would give him a chance to live in the next few years.
The fact that he got out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised at what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to starting.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to the expert, the departure of this Morning's host, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost millions of companies millions of dollars from pillows and candles to rent and homewear due to the large amounts and possible slides of the company.
And it could mean the end of a new story.
The three children's hostess and husband Dan Baldwin, who spent ten years in the past, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby Capp launched the Trulyt with Willoughby Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together and have a 40 percent share in Baldwin's news production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product archive and will take over Ant McPartlin's place as the host of the ITV I'm Celebrity show.
Last night a source close to one of them commented on what happened: “We do not want to comment on [Jones]’ business matters.”
They said hard things, "that's why we're in love".
He was concerned about the criticisms he was going to receive from the press for his statement that some might consider to be "unrestrained" and why he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
– asked Trump if he was "hives".
- I didn't let anything happen."
As you noted, Kim would also like to meet for the second time after the first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed the nuclear bombing of North Korea as a huge step forward.
However, the negotiations on nuclear fission have gone unnoticed.
More than three months after the June Singapore Summit, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea on Saturday, told the United Nations General Assembly that, as your country sees, no "adequate answer" from the United States will be given to early North Korea's exorcism action.
Instead, according to the United States, the United States will continue to maintain the sanctions for practising.
Trump was more optimistic in a campaign.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
- We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost there.
But now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have seen positive results – the completion of missiles, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was talking about his relationship with Kim in such a unusual way.
“It’s hard to be a leader, but right now there’s not a 10,000 mass out there trying to get in there, but you’re just like 200 in front of me,” said Trump, pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, more than a dozen people have died of an island-shaking tsunami and earthquake.
Indonesia has refused to assist international aid organisations even after the earthquake in Lomboki.
More than 10 percent of the population of any wallets had to be installed, no national disaster has been reported, which would be a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
“In many cases, it has been very clear in many cases that they do not require international assistance, so it is a very difficult situation,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children Foundation is already working on the compilation of a Palu accessible emergency team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a National Defence Agency spokesperson, says that the Indonesian authorities are currently carrying out an assessment of the request situation to see if it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the fact that the earthquake is ongoing in Indonesia, the country is facing the devastating nature of nature in a most complete way.
While in the region of Aceh it was built in tsunamis, it is not uncommon in other coastal areas.
The same has been true, the obvious lack of the sensor siren system in Paru has also contributed to the development of a humane disaster in Paru.
Traffic between the Indonesians may be difficult even in the right time.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
There is a flight to Palau that is stationed in one of the logs, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
Either President Widodo has placed the development of the colossal infrastructure of Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign and has not saved the costs of road and rail projects.
However, the Joko-government now faces budgetary deficits before next year's elections.
The President must also face the tensions of the parties still present in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people had to die and tens of thousands of people were forced to leave because of the riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs were living on the streets with bush cutters, bows and arrows and other armed weapons.

The bullet was high above the sixteen, and it was heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the bedroom at the top of the kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to be in a position because there is always someone like Shaq, who's playing the ball in advance, so I tried to put myself in a better position,” Sturridge said in response to the question of F.FC.com.
- I saw Kante arrive, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think too much, and I shot him."
Chelsa led 1 to 0 in the middle of the half, after receiving the lead in 25 minutes with the goal of the Belgian star player Eden Härd.
With the blue battle corner corner, Mateo Kovačič received the ball and then managed to break off on the middle course and rush in towards the bottom.
Kovačič started after a quick injection and got the ball back on the middle course.
Then, with a direct transfer, he started MERD towards the sixteenth.
Returned to the defense and finally sent the ball with a left shot to the remote corner at the gate at the gate by Alisson Becker.

The Parliament's statue Cromwell is the last victim of the story-renewal fever.
The exile of the Soviets could perhaps be poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and church heritage by the followers of Cromwell and his fanatical puritants in the time of Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to Cromwell, Crick's proposal is "hungry", a "test to rewrite history."
According to the president of the Cromwell President, John Goldsmith: “It was essential that, at some point in the current discussions on the removal of statues, the Oliver Cromwell statue before the Westminster Palace should eventually become a target.
During the British Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell could be a victim of his own blow-up in the past century, for his actions in Thomas's life.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycraft's impressive Cromwell vibration reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and presents a memory of a historic form that many still believe should be observed today."
In this regard, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell today is much less than in the late 19th century, but many of Parliament is still considered to be the protector of external protection, which, of course, was the Monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate is still the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict in the mid-19th century has had an impact on the development of the future destiny of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person representing one of the sides of this conflict.
And we are worthy to celebrate and commemorate the achievements of the President-General."
A killer wounded to death was a Chinese master.
According to local press reports, an attack attacked and injured a farmer to death in a market in the south of China.
Only a man identified as Yuan on the cable was found with a sprained vertebrae, excluding blood, found on the market in Liupanshui city of Guangzhou, reported the case on the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A breeding host is preparing to inoculate the breed with a vaccine in a farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, China in Chinghai Province, Xining City, China.
The man traveled with his sister from the nearby Junnan Province to sell 15 pieces at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the man on his cousin's body and discovered that the next door door was open.
According to him, the giant candizon mouth in the locust was bloody.
According to the report, the expert survey found that the owner was indeed the 250-pound pig to death.
“My sister’s feet were bloody and they were crucified,” he said, by Guiyang Evening News, only a relative named Wujana on the wire.
Security footage shows that Yuan entered the silo at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning, to feed the larvae.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man-killing animal was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that it was blocked so that no harm would be done to others while the police were investigating the trails on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities report that they are currently discussing compensation for man's death.
Although it does not happen often, there have been reports of bad people who have been attacked before.
In 2016, on their maschusettsi farm, a couple of men were attacked and injured in a dangerous way by men.
Ten years earlier, in a 300-pound-a-kilo in Wales, he forced a master to his tractor until the man's wife failed to shake him.
After eating an Oregon farmer from his own country in 2012, a master in Manitoba spoke in CBC News about the fact that pigs are not generally prone to attack, but the taste of the blood can become aggressive.
“The players are great.
Like little children, very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect," he said.
Heavy rains following the Hurricane Rosa in the south-west region of the United States of America.
Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker, as predicted, as it reaches the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfall in the north of Mexico and the south of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck by windfalls of 140 km/h, as a 1st-grade hurricane, by the Eastern coast time of Sunday at 5 a.m., at 620 a.m., from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, to the south of 620 km.
The Hurricane is expected to be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone develops over the Pacific Ocean and is heading west towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches to Lower California on Monday, as a tropical storm, floods the south-west regions of the United States with severe tropical double mass as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm could bring up to 25 cm of precipitation into some areas of Mexico.
Next, the meeting with nearby low-pressure masses will result in tropical humid rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here are the floods of between 3 and 10 centimeters, the floods of debris, and the floods of earth in the desert, causing earthfalls.
The heavy tropical humidge may cause a mean of 5-8 cm of precipitation, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the south are expected to have between 5 and 10 cm of precipitation, especially in Arizona.
Sudden shocks may also occur, with a rapidly declining strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
In particular, in the case of tropical rains, it is not recommended to start in the desert.
Because of the heavy rainfalls, canons can turn into congeal rivers, and the floods are accompanied by flashes and dust clouds in place.
Incoming low-pressure crowds may in some cases cause severe rainfall in the South California coast.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause smaller floods with debris and can cause flat road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the season in the region.
White tropical showers can appear already on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, then on Mondays during the day and on Tuesdays, the rain covers a wider range of drinking.
The heavy rain spreads over the four-serious region on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense fluctuations in temperature in the United States as circular air masses cool, but the tropicals will remain quite warm.
This may, however, lead to dramatic variations in temperature at long distances.
this is an excellent example of the situation in the Middle region of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is close to 10 degrees between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
In the coming days, it is expected that the summer heat will become visible in larger areas even in the next few days.
In the middle and east of the United States it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the south of the Great Plains to some parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term weather forecasts suggest that temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October are likely to exceed average temperatures.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
In total, six TVs were followed by more than 20 million viewers, calling for the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the highest-ranking referee, and his eighty-year-old woman, Blasy Ford, who accused her of rape.
Meanwhile, the political emergency was not resolved, and broadcasters had to break up the regular programme due to the last-minute turn of Friday: Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told his Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure that at that time a high school party at Kavanaugh was holding and trying to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that he was 100 percent sure that this was not happening.
The statements were seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average rating of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC for Nielsen.
The numbers of the hearing intermediary's other channels, such as PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has difficulty in measuring the number of people watching shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, that's what you see as a football player or an award-dealer.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, a member of all the channels supporting the appointment of Kavanaugh, had the highest number of, on average, 5.6 million viewers throughout the entire day of the hearing.
Second place, the ABC consists of 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS 3,1, NBC 2,.4., MSNBC 2,89, while the CNN was viewed by 2.2 million, according to the Nielsen report.
The interest in the interview was not reduced after the interview.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican Senator issued a statement stating that Senator Kavanaugh is taking his vote, it was seen on CNN and CBS this morning in the morning as the loud crowd of protestors will receive it as they try to get to the meeting of the court-martial committee in the Presidency.
He stood up for a minute while the crowd was screaming and CNN was broadcasting the scene live.
“Here I stand before you,” said a woman to the senator.
- Do you really believe that Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public in the country?"
Others shouted: “You have the power to do what so many women do not. ”
Flave just said that his office issued a statement, and then before closing the lift door, he added that he would share his word at the Commission hearing.
The cable and programme channels were seen live hours later, as the Committee recommends, whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination for the entire Senate would be extended to vote in favour of the entire Senate.
Flave said, however, that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week as advocated by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake has been convinced of the need for this in his discussions with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
Flake ended up following conversations with the Cons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was taken properly because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, is accusing the opponents of Brexit with political representation.
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of leaving the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interests by their political defences.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Theresa May, will arrive at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview on the website directly next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea of managing each other's customs duties is "in fact absurd".
The Wayde Sims murder: the police arrested Dyteon Simpson, the victim of the LSU player's murder, in the custody of Dyteon Simpson, who was killed by the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year basketball players from Louisiana State University (LSU) on the death of Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested for serious instigation of a manslaughter, announced by the police captain of Baton Rouge.
The police published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and they also reported that Sims's glasses fell during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene, and wearing Simpson's DNA, they said on the WAFB channel for the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, the police announced that the young man admitted to shooting Simst.
According to Advoate's report, the court set the bail at $30,000.
According to a preliminary report issued on Friday by the medical examiner of the East Baton Rouge County, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police for the investigation leading up to the arrest of the suspect, the criminal police laboratory, the university police and the residents of the area.
Joe Alleva, LSU's Director of Attitude, thanked the competent law enforcement authorities for their “commitment and persevering work in finding out the truth.
She was 20 years old.

“Man is always afraid that something will happen”, said Wade.
Volcano floods the city of Helsinki with ash.
The ashes fired from a volcano in the Popo district reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
After the volcanic activity increased in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash were fired during 24 hours, the National Rescue Prevention Centre requested the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The Centre has also observed several larvae and alarms.
The images on the Community portal show the windshields of cars in each region of the city, for example in Xochimillco, are covered by a thin moustache covering the windshields of cars.
Geophisicians observed an increase in the activity of a volcano located 72 km south-west from the capital of Mexico after an earthquake of 7,1 in September 2017, shaking the middle region of Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police met with the Catalan Separatists during the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protestors ran into the war and thousands joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the referendum on the stand-up referendum on Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists had their tailsed with eggs and paint powders, so the other streets, which were packed with tourists, were now covered with dense dust paint.
There were further fights later this day, during which the police tried to maintain order with a gang of officers.
“We do not forget, we do not forgive” were confronted by the independent faction faction groups, and the unit protestors behind the slogan “Live Spain” have been dealing for hours with each other.
According to local press reports, 14 people were injured with minor injuries to protests.
The tension will not continue to decrease in the region that has been transferred by independence efforts, following the referendum on 1 October, which is considered unlawful by Madrid, but which was held unlawful by the Catalan Separatists.
The voters voted in favour of the break-up by a large majority, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unions had boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop the vote in the polls by means of aggressive conflicts.
Independent parties were on the street all night on Friday night to prevent a mission to support the National Police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the mission did not end up on the right track.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old panorama participating in separatist protests, believes that there is no longer any chance that Catalonia will gain its independence.
“It was the best time of our lives.
I can see my parents’ tears of joy, for which we can vote, but by now our case has been covered," he said.
Although the regional elections in December last year have been an important success, even if there is a narrow victory, it is difficult for the Catalan independent parties to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are awaiting a court judgment on their role in the organisation of the referendum and in the exclamation of independence.
42-year-old auto mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded a police statement on the phone, said that the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he says.
Oriol Junqueras, a leader of one of the Catalans who was awaiting prior arrest last year, announced on Saturday that he would start in the European Parliament elections next year.
“I reject most of the devalation of democratic values and the repression represented by the Government of Spain if I am a candidate in the European elections”, he said.
Court: the police arrested three men who drove into a house with their car.
The police arrested a 33, 34 and a 39-year-old male who drove into a house in Londonder by car several times.
This incident occurred at around 7:30 Ballynagard Crescent this summer.
According to Detective Bob Blemmings, the gate and the building itself have been damaged.
At some point in time, the car may have been shot with a machine.
Menga's goal was 1-0 of the Livingston team at the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal was to secure the Livingston victory with his first goal.
In the first class, Livingston recently entered the first class surprised the Rangers team by also getting Steven Gerrard to lose his second defeat, who has been working as a Ibroxe brand since 18 months ago.
Dolly Menga's stork meant the real difference, because Gary Holt's team went to the competition with the Hibernian team in second place.
Thus, the Gerrards continued to lose their alien victory during the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they will face the first-place Hearts team, which is about eight points behind them.
Before that, however, the Rangers are still waiting for a match in the European League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston added its division's victory series to six victorys, which means that Kenny Miller last month has not yet been released by the team.
Livingston has missed a number of situations in relation to the inaccuracies of the unaccurationally-playing team.
Dead's team could've gotten the lead before the only ogol in the match, because with their attack weapon, they didn't have a lot of problems for Rangers.
But he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt turned out to be widespread after he slipped in to reach Craig Halt's cross-sectional end.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure that they could interfere with the guests in fixed play situations.
The lottery goal came from a situation exactly like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robin created a situation for Menga, who, using it, in the middle of the 16th grade.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in a football court, but domestic protection still proved to be impracticable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly in danger.
This trend continued during the second half of the game, apart from the only situation in which Spi had to defend Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman hit the Rangers' gate, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed his new free kick in Livingston.
On the other hand, the transverse balls arrived at the sixteenth of Livingston, but the defenders passed every time. Two perps were not received by the attack team: one sixth of the players who joined Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other one by hand because of the guarantee.
The "Beneficial" game from Livingston – a match analysis.
Tony Macaroni of Aréna means Alasdair Lamont, the informant of the BBC Scotland.
Livingston has given phenomenal performance and has been cutting back the money.
The players were both excellent and successful, and in a row past the wait.
The team members and their game style have barely changed since they returned to the ground, but Holt's efforts deserve serious recognition, since the coach's arrival, he's been upsetting the team.
Several players have brought the best form of the game.
Six team captains have formed a great deal of protection with their excellent organization, and Menga has been drinking Connor Goldson and Joe Worrald properly.
The Rangers had no idea.
As well as they are occasionally well under Gerrard's leadership, they were now able to bring that level.
The last one was always missing from the formula, which was also the only time they managed to achieve domestic protection, so the Rangers need to get together quickly, as they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdo Jan found a joint reception in Cologne.
The meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany was held on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
This was the last day of the Erdo -an sharer's visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving the relationship between NATO countries.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues relating to human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdo later traveled to Cologne to celebrate a newly built, huge mosque opening ceremony in Cologne.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
On grounds of security, he has banned the gathering of 25 000 people in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters have appeared to be able to see the Turkish Prime Minister.
In addition, hundreds of protesters against Erdo - Erdo -an, including several Kurdishs, have expressed their disapproval of Erdo -ian's policy and that the German Government has decided in favour of the reception of the Prime Minister.
The two opposing statements well illustrate the role of the president's policy in sharing the role played by some Turkish-origin German citizens as heroes, while others see the carkrata in it.
Road accident in Deptford: hit a bicycle car and lost his life by a car.
He lost a bicycle's life when he ran into a car in London.
The rampage took place on Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, at about 10:15 a.m., at the local time, at the intersection of the high-speed route from the south of the city to the south of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the rescuers tried to help me on the bike, but he died on the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cycle of non-refoulement gas has become a fatal victim on Childers Street, just a mile from the accident in Saturday.
According to the London police statement, the police continue to work to determine the identity of the man so that they can notify relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus transfers make transport more difficult and the authorities advise that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six jackets were injured during a conversation.
Six of them were injured in a highly guarded man in prison in a break-out of riots, announced by the prison board.
The riots started at 09:30 a.m. at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and could not control them yet.
In order to manage the situation, the competent authorities have placed on the scene a special task force named Tornado. In the riots, eight prisoners are involved, who have been repressed to a warden.
The members of the special task force suffered some minor head injuries that were managed at the site.
Statement by the enforcer of the sentence organisation: “The specialized police team handles the situation in Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
In our prisons, we will not tolerate violence at any level, and the responsible will be handed over to the police and may expect further execution of the sentence."
In the Long Lartin Man Penitentiary, more than 500 convictions are held, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden of the prison had to be treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, too, it was necessary to assist the Special Forces in the crackdown on a serious disturbance during which the prisoners attacked their prison staff with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Laset, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but the situation in the areas affected by the drought may improve)
Arizona will be hit by tropical depressions, but this is probably what the state should expect to expect next week, when the rest of the Hurricane called Rosa is swept through the deserted southern region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has also ordered a flood station on Monday and Tuesday, from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the south-east areas of California and Utah; it also concerns the cities of Var, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring large rains with it.
Phoenix meteorological services published the following message on the website: “Since 2050, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phonenix in a tropical storm or depression!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) approached the border of AZ, for example, 40 miles away."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 mm of precipitation, which in extreme cases, for example, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, can reach 150 mm.
Other parts of the southern desert areas (in the middle areas of the ski slopes, the Great Basin, etc.) can be expected to be between 25 and 50 mm, but in some places it may fall between 100 mm.
Rosa’s rain can cause relief for areas not threatened by lightning lakes, as the area is currently suffering from severe droughts.
Despite the fact that floods pose a serious threat, some of the rain can have a beneficial effect on the south-west information about the shelter.
“According to the US Emergency Surveillance Service, over 40% of the Arizona area is affected by a minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com’s report.
The Hurricane Rosa will first land on the half of Mexico's low-california.
It will continue to be Hurricane, and on Sunday morning, bringing up to 137 km/h slices, it will travel about 600 km south of the Mexican Punta Eugenia and will travel approximately 19 km/h northwards.
The storm meets the colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
Thus, it is expected that the coasts of Mexico will be again as a tropical storm either Monday afternoon or evening hours.
In certain areas of these areas, dense mustow may be expected, which will significantly increase the chances of flooding.
“The rain can cause an average of 70–150 mm precipitation from Lower California to the western part of Sonora, where 250 mm may fall,” says the Weather.com report.
Rosa then travels northwards as a tropical storm before arriving early in the morning at Arizona's border before Tuesday, before arriving in tropical depression, in order to get through Arizona, on Tuesday night, to Utah's southern territories on Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remains in Lower California, North-West Sonor, and the Southwest desert regions of the United States is expected to be extreme rain,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rains may be expected to cause life-threatening wild-forest waters and waterfalls in desert areas and to be kept from landslides in mountain areas.

Hundreds of people died in a flood of an earthquake in Indonesia, rising in numbers of deaths.
Many were lost and at least 384 people lost their lives when the giant waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a severe earthquake and a flood on the island of Suowesi, Indonesia, and was declared on Saturday by the local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu at a festival held on a Friday, when the high waves reached the coast at the time of the fall at close to six meters (1 foot) and many went down and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The fountain price was caused by an earthquake with a height of 7.5.
"When the fugitive observation was heard yesterday, people kept on the coast, they didn't escape, so the waves became a victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come in, drove cars, vans, houses and everything else from the beach,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was at a speed of 800 km/h outside before reaching the beach.
There were those who climbed up the top of a tree from the flood and got saved, said.
Approximately 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 places of refuge Please.
There are several destroyed buildings and shops, several twisted and collapsed bridges and a water-circuited mosques in the air-reports reported by the Agency in the event of a disaster.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shocked by further post-rearing events on Saturday.
Earthquakes were detected in an area where some 2.4 million people live on.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Safety Assessment and Application (BPPT), approximately 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hirosima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions may have strengthened the impact of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused is “important”, thousands of houses have been destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shops and hotels have collapsed.
Several victims were found among the ruins of the collapsing buildings, he said, and added that the number of victims has been 540 so far, and they are looking for another 29 people.
Nugroho stated that the number of injured persons and the damage may be higher in the coastal region, called Donggala, 300 km from Palu (190 km) and 300 km (190 km) from Donggala, as it was closer to the outbreak of the earthquake.
Communication “is completely paralyzed, there is no information available” about Donggala, Nugroho said.
"more than 300 000 people live there", says the Red Cross communication, which also announced that the experts and volunteers of the organization are on their way to the disaster area.
“The situation is tragic now, but it can be even worse,” they added.
The Agency received a number of criticisms on Saturdays about not informing the population about the flooding price of the Palut, but, according to the management, the attacks reached the coast while the alarm was being issued.
On a third-party video shared on social sites, a man is seen who is trying to warn street users of the approaching fountain with desperate shouts from above a building.
Within a few minutes, there will be a huge waterfall on the coast, sliding cars and buildings along with it.
The Reuters Intelligence Agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the admission.
The earthquake and the flood have caused a loss of power, avoiding communication in Paru, making it more difficult for authorities to perform rescue work.
The military transport of relief supplies from jakarta and other cities, but the authorities believe that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential goods.
The airport of the city has only been opened to facilitate assistance work and will remain closed for all other purposes until October.
Either President Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centres set up by the Új on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian fugitive price exceeds 800.
It's a bad thing.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala in the town of Palu, where employees found shelter under the tent poles set up in the office court, but they met with the consequences of a terrible destruction on their way, he reported to Dose.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined homes,” he added.
- It's really bad."
While the relief teams added to the preparation of disaster response work, some complained that foreign experts with great experience in this area were unable to travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief and personnel from overseas can only be admitted to the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared a disaster at national level.
That didn't happen so far.
“The case will continue to be treated as a state-level disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, one of the spokespersons of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As soon as the government acknowledges that it is a disaster at national level, we can allow international emergency services, but no notification has yet been made."
On the second night after Friday's alarm and the fountain, I ask the friends and family of the Missings to remain hoping that their loved ones will be among those whose escape from the wonders is a great source of light in the dark atmosphere of the coverages about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who was two days behind her mother's body, who had fallen under the ruins.
Gendon Subandono, a national umbrella team coach in Indonesia, prepared two contestants for Asian Games at the beginning of the month, which this time took place in Indonesia.

Mr Gendon recalled that when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread between the screens, for hours he was desperate to reach the contestants who were at the beach festival, please, at WhatsApp.
However, in addition to the messages, only a single grey pipe appears instead of two blue pipe.

Kanye West: the name of the rapper Yér changed Yér
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye from now on.
The change was announced on Saturday on the news with the following message: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
For some time, 41-year-old West has been called Ye nickname, and that was the address of the eighth album of June.
The change of name was announced before Saturday Night Live, where you will be presenting your new album Yandhi.
She takes over Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled her session on the grounds of "emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only an amendment to the current artist of the rapper – according to recent statements, West has a religious significance for West.
“I know that “Ye” is the most used word in the Bible and in the Bible means “you”, said West earlier when he spoke of his album’s address with Big Boy Radio host.
- So I'm you and I'm us and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it only became Ye, which represents the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album rather reflects who we really are."
One of those famous rappers who change their names with love.
So far, Sean Combs has also been running under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he is now using the names Love and Brother Love.
His former associate, JAY-Z, has also changed several times whether his name should be written in parallel with, with, or with capital letters.
The Mexican President agreed not to engage in an army against civilians.
The Mexican president of Andrés, López Obrador, promised in connection with the coming 50th anniversary of the prehistoric student confessions that he would never use the military against the citizens.
López Obrador, on Saturday at Tlatelco, promised: “Never will he use the army to repress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on the square to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing about 300 deaths, when the left-hand student movements showed signs of hardening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans – he provides monthly financial support for students and plans to set up additional free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and the lack of education are the two main factors that lead young people to the arms of criminal unions.
The U.S. should double the financing framework for Mi-solutions.
As China is becoming increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, has declared Kai-Fu Lee, a provider and user of solutions using artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple before.
He then said that the United States Government made notifications about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States has no formal MI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
“The duplication of the cost framework for Mi-research would be a good start, since all other countries are significantly behind the US and are on the way to the next breakthrough of Mi-research,” said Lee.
The possibility of the next major step being taken in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States of America could also be doubled by double the amount of aid for research, he said in an interview with the CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director-General of the Singing Futures Company. The company has invested in one of China's most important companies, Mi-Fi, in Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon on a Mi system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later acted as a member of the management board of Microsoft Research and as a member of the branch of Google USA.
Lee acknowledged the results of technological competitions previously announced by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when they would host the next event, because it would be possible to explore new future designers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain the state support they need to research, said Lee.
“China is not obsessing about scientific entities, but about large companies,” he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have, over the years, been awarding several major university skulls to work on what they work on.
It seems that a change in immigration policy could also help the United States’ efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that you should automatically get green cards for those with a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Council of China announced its next generation plan for the development of artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science base provides support to the staff of the academic institutions in a similar way, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations provide money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the Ministry of Defence of the United States of America set up Joint Artistic Intelligence Center Mi-centre, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the setting up of a committee designated by the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI initiative,
The NSF is currently investing $100 million a year in support of Mi-research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which was planning to establish a national security committee, has not taken any further steps in this matter for months.
In Macedonia, a referendum is held on changing the name of the country.
The population of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Sea-Macedon Republic". This step would resolve a dispute with Greece over several decades, which prevented the country from accepting its application for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates a need for a similar Greek territory, and has so far protected the country's NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments entered into negotiations on the new name of the state, but according to national protesters, the name change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the start of the boycott campaign, it became questionable whether there would be a 50% participation rate required for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballots is: ‘Does the country support the NATO and EU member and accept the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the name change, Mr Zoran Zaev, in the lead, argue that this price is worth paying in order to allow Macedonia, as one of the countries that have risen in the ruins of Yugoslavia, to join the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Mr. Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopä.
Although the referendum is not legally binding in itself, an adequate parliamentary member has declared it binding on himself for the result of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change names.
According to the Committee on Public Electoral Affairs, no irregularities were reported until 3:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate has reached only 16% until now. This figure was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately accounted for 66% of the registered voters).
"I have voted in favour of my child because we have our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in Skop, the capital of Scotland," said Gjose Tanevski.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and their sons, Dushko, placed their voks in Stromica, on the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO in the process of making a commitment.
In Skop, outside the Parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for bojcotts to vote.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it with a proud, elevated head, not through the chat door,” said Kádarkov.
- We are a country of our own, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you don't want to accept us as Macedonia, you can go to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration."
According to Zaev, NATO membership can be counted against investments in Macedonia, which the country with an unemployment rate above 20% is in need of much more than 20%.
“I think that the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country’s population essentially supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He also added that the vote "yes" means "insurement of the future of the country".
According to a survey conducted by the Macedonia Political Research Institute last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the necessary participation rate.
On the basis of another survey prepared by the Macedonian Telma TV, a 57% participation rate is expected to be observed on the basis of a 57% participation rate.
70% of those who want to vote have said yes to those who want to vote.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least 50% more than one vote.
The validity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government that came into force last May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguoro, the player in the city of Manchester, has the full protection of Brighton in exchange for a goal to get a goal in exchange for full protection.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were very well-managed with the protection of Brighton, so that the Ötihads of England won the Ötihads victory in Ötihad, England on Saturday.
Aguero got his target shot in 65 minutes as if that was the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinian battle, as the first step of the attack, received a pass in the middle of the middle, and
Within the three shields of Brighton, he reached the open field by walking out between the three shields.
Then four green bees surrounded Aguro by Aguero took over four green beads.
He called out a lawyer and then ran more than that, reaching out to 14th in Brighton.
After that, he left the Sterling that appears there.
The English battle has already returned the ball firmly to Aguero within the sixteenth, who finished the operation with his right foot, inventing the bridge on the right side of the gate to Mathew Ryan, the netman in Brighton.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” he told the reporters, Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manuscript.
- We agreed that 55, 60 minutes and up to 60 minutes can be played.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, you will have achieved your goal."
The initial advantage was achieved by Sterling’s action on blues during the English championship match.
Agol was born in the 29th minute when he was born.
Aguero, a far away from Brightonia, was given a great pass.
He started a cross-circuit towards Leroy Sane on the left side of the left.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling long.
By battle with the blues, he was just able to toss the ball into the gate before he slipped off the base line.
The town's nearest Tuesday, 12:55 p.m., in Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, is speaking with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions' League.
Scherzer is making it difficult for him to do his job.
Since the team of the Axes missed the opportunity to enter the post, there was no reason for them to make real efforts.
However, the always competitive Scherzer waits to be able to take on a Sunday career against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has the chance to play it. The Rockies will have a huge advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
At least a comforting place has been secured by the Rockies with the 5-2 victory against the Nationals this evening, but the first division address is still waiting for you.
“Even though we no longer have a chance, we can stand up against them that the atmosphere of the public and the other team in Denver is expected to be at the roof of the whole year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get on track!"
The team of the Worlds has yet to choose the player on Sunday, but the news is that in this situation Scherzer will be the drummer.
Scherzer, who took part in a drum training on Thursday, this is going to be the 34th starting Sunday, which is usually his resting day.
The right-handed Washington player stands at 220 and 2/3 games this season with 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 strikes.
Trump in West Virginia is campaigned
The President also appealed to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Judge, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything that we have done so far is at stake.
We're only five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the big ones, the big ones - I'm not running in person, but I'm actually leaving, which is why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can use whatever means they want to regain power, to see malice and subduedness.
No matter who is harmed, who is swept away for the purpose of control in their hands, they must have power, they want control and power, but we do not leave ourselves."
According to the president, the Democrats use "preventiveness and prevention".
"They could have seen all this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "democratics, angry and malicious and low-down and lying."
Mr. Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Court of Justice Committee, spoke by name of a democratic senator, who has been told that the gathered crowd has been dissatisfied with.
“Do you remember what else he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, uh, no, wait - all this with a very bad rumor of body language, it was the worst word I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who speak freely what they think.
I'm not surprised at all when the Moment's activists decided to censor my censorship in their own party.
After all, I'm only the last in a long series of Labour Members who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we said what we think.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has been treated in the same way as he did against anti-semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Corby Corby.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically precisely the issues in which they also disagreed with the previous leaders.
At an invitation to a working party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that they would like a "introductory and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Work Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
But today, however, the voice has changed, and the assumption of a more "retarded, more polite" policy has been forgotten, even if it ever happened.
It is increasingly striking that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether or not it is acceptable for the leader of the Party.
This trend started shortly after becoming the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought they were similar to our political attitude were expected more and more recently to turn their backs on my individual opinion and to take action on things that I would never agree with, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public talk, regardless of what I actually said, they start to float on social sites, they demand my withdrawal, they criticise the policy of the middle, and they tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am happier than many of my colleagues, because my comments to me tend to be on politics in general.
I am thinking of the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to engage on a daily basis in sexual and racist attacks, but do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Corby last week spoke about the need for the Labour Party to support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with all the "infidelity" attitude and all the changes to the electoral rules, the circle of people in the party is increasingly narrowing down.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to regain myself, not to be so eloquent, and then " everything will be fine."
However, that's not why I took the political course.
32 years ago, I joined the Workers' Party as a student because it upsets me that the Thatcher government has so neglected schools that our classroom is almost disoriented, and then I have fought for a better perspective, both as a local councillor and as a government minister for the most needy.
I've never been able to hide my political views, and I've done nothing else during the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was perfectly clear to everyone what political positions I was pursuing and on which I disagree with the current management.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to use time and energy to challenge my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Force.
My most important message, however, is not for the members of the Nottingham Moment, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that any demise or political threat will not hinder me from acting in my own opinion and in the interests of everyone.
Chris Leslie, representative of Nottingham East.
Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr is going to break into the top of the top.
Two late attempts have been somewhat modified in the end, but there is no way to win Ayr's deserved victory at the most entertaining match of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one of the ten teams in a row.
Thanks to their immediate protection and a high level of positioning, they have won, so their homelands and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a great challenge in our previous fights, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We must recognize that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we do.”
Grant Anderson's experiment of which Frazier Climo made a point in 14 minutes gave Ayr an advantage. Due to the yellow paper from Rory Hughes, which was sold by the Soldiers, Melrose would have been able to get the difference, but it was not a point to try Baggott.
Climo was sweating Ayr in the middle of the middle, and then a point from a single experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-score for Ayr.
Melrose made a strong start on the second half, sold Baggot to Patrick Anderson, reducing the edge of the team to five points.
The game was a long time ago, as Ruardh Knott suffered serious injury and had to be removed from the course, and Ayr continued to increase its benefits through the attempt by Staffford McDowall, whose profits were managed by Climo.
Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in the human world, thus breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to intercede again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for setting up Clio without a ball, MacPherson presented from the penalty line touch down behind Ayr's attack team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the start, when Kyle Row took down David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry forward to take the five-to-fifth strike of the homes.
The main character of Still Game has started a new career in the catering industry.
Looks like one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is heading for the catering industry: it turns out that a restaurant has been run by a management company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in a popular series of BBCs, written together and formed together with his old comedian, Greg Hemfill.
The couple announced that the next ninth season would be the final season, and it seems that Kiern is planning the afterlife of the afterlife.
According to the official record, he was the Director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiern was trying to profit from the “flowering catering industry” of Glasgow.
"The sea is its own": the uncoastal Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines patrol the Sailor Sailor Sailors in La Paz, around La Paz.
In the middle, ocean blue flags are flying in the middle.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon report the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
We have a duty to recover."
The memories of the lost coast in Bolivia, without a beach, are still alive, which was taken by Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century with resources, and the desire to re-energise the Pacific Ocean is strong.
For many years these hopes may have been the most powerful, for Bolivia is waiting for five years for the judgment of the Court of Justice to close.
“Bolivia has the ball that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, who look forward to the end in a positive mood,” Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said.
A lot of Bolivian observers have taken into account the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, hoping that the Hague Court will stand for Bolivia and that, after several decades of violent attitudes, Chile will be obliged to sit at a meeting so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, indigenous President of Bolivia, who is looking at a conflicting fight that must be pursued next year for re-election, may lose a lot with the Monday judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that would not change much if its decision were favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body responsible for the matter has no right to rule over the Chilean territories, and it also foretold that it would not affect the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the Court of Justice was born almost six months after the closing speeches indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Záre Paz, Chilean expert in international law.
Over the past four years, it has not helped the case of Bolivia, but it has even been withdrawn.
“The issue of the sea exit has been changed by the current Bolivian Government for its own purposes,” Zárate said.
- Because of Morales' retorts in opposition, the leftovers of the Chileans have gone away."
It will certainly continue negotiations at one point, but after what has happened, it will be very difficult to engage in dialogue.
Two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagrees with the finding that the trial would have been urgent.
A "exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile" and a chance for "both of them to come out well from the closure of 139 years of conflict", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the debate at sea to make a political advantage of it.
“Bívia will never give up her right to the Pacific Ocean,” she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see: it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: there is no nuclear decommissioning until you can trust America.
Rongho, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, says that his country will not first surrender its nuclear weapons if you cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, he spoke before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made to the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore Summit.
He made a comment when it appeared that the American Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo managed to re-start the blocked nuclear war, more than three months after the war with the North Korean leader, Kim Jongun, in Singapore.
According to Mr. R., "I desire" to believe that constant sanctions and the American resistance to the declaration that the Korean war ended will never be enough to force North Korea to kneel on its knees.
The adoption of the declaration will continue if Phenan does not take significant steps towards landing.
US President Kim Jongun and Donald Trump are seeking a new summit.
However, the belts of broad-range scepticism include the commitment of Phenjan to the removal of the arsenal, which is considered to be the only key to the country's risk of security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Phoenix next month to prepare for another kim-trump peak.
In Paris, fashion shows are the huge headgear that will soon appear in top-class shops.
If you want to extend your collection of hats or wish to complete the day completely, you will no longer have to look for it.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headphones as part of their 2019 Spring/March collection, which was widely welcomed by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
It is not practical to have pageds sensitized in summer, and the above fashion designers also gave attention to their awareness-raising works.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an over-the-counter beige hat, which was ordinary, wide-scale charma-painted, and almost completely swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized additions, there was a gem bed with gem, a sorcerer base, and even an anaesthetic, which were not really designed to keep man’s head warm.
In addition, Thom One brought out a range of weird masks, just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouth sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a diving mask, covered with pipe and glasses, and the other one looked like a melting bonnet ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The archeologists predict that the giant caps may be on their way to the top class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of La Bomba, a 60-inch wide-looped straw hat that we have seen on everyone from Rihanna to (2009) Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind a slightly practical hat, which conquers social sites, presented another piece on the outskirts: a straw bag that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that lasts.
The dark orange rafia bag, decorated by rafiabs and on top of it there is a white-haired hat, was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacquemus 2019 Spring/Sun La Riviera collection on the Paris Fashion Week.
The star star star, Luke Armitage, told the FEMIIL: “I expect that next summer the huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top-class clothing stores. The designer has caused a basic effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny existing demand for oversized accessories.”
Edward: Language knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world.
In the absence of further excellent test results, this situation has not changed by 2018, which will be further strengthened by individual and group successes in sport, art, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are studying in such institutions as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are seeking to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further learning, higher education, their chosen careers and the position they play as world citizens.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and implement tailor-made school curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language you understand, it gets to your head.
But if you speak his language, it goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
From this year's test results, we see that students from all over the country have produced the best results from foreign languages.
68 per cent of all students studying foreign language reached a higher degree (85 per cent more).
On the basis of the data from the SSIS 74 school, 72% of students received a higher degree of A from Mandarin, while 72 students in German, 69 from French and 63% from Spaniards reached A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be essential knowledge, the knowledge of which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as a chosen object have become at least as important as science, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey of the United Kingdom's Committee on Employment and Vocational Training showed that 17 per cent of employers believe that there are difficulties in filling empty positions due to a lack of language knowledge.
This shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to allow young people to pursue a successful career.
As more and more jobs expect knowledge of foreign languages, language knowledge is essential in a global world.
No matter what careers one chooses, if he learns a foreign language, he acquires a lifelong knowledge with clear benefits.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically provides a competitive advantage to a multilingual speaker.
According to YouGov's survey, in which 4000 adults were asked in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not know well enough in any foreign language to be able to speak and the French was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15%) of respondents.
It is important that we focus more on teaching the language of children.
Talking in more languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in children's hands to make it easier for adults to apply for more important jobs when they bleed up.
In all schools in Scotland, they will deal with different languages in every school.
School will focus on the classic modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be outstanding for the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the child's field of interest, you can learn more optional languages at school and will be teachers who will be experts in your own field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not hard to notice that in the current global business environment, languages are still vital for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be seen as a "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer the opportunity of choice, diverse and high-quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this should be the case.
Mr Edward, the President of the Scottish Council of Independent Arts
LeBron is appearing on Lakers on the LeBron Springs Sunday.
You don't have to wait long for the fans who sit on their faces to see LeBron James first step in the colors of Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers' manufacturer, Luke Walton, announced that James was going to play the opening game of the preseason Sunday against Denver Nuggets in the United States.
How long it will take on course is still questionable.
“More than one, and less than 48,” wrote Walton on the Lakers official website.
The director of the Lakers, Mike Trudell, told me that James would probably only be working for a short period of time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-millimeter first season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in front of my career to be ready,” she replied.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel.
Donald Trump is going to start a long series of event events in Western Virginia this evening.
This will be the first of Trump's five debut events next week, including those that support him, Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that a vote has been postponed to confirm the candidate of the Supreme Court's vacant seat, Trump will endeavour to collect supporters for the next mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over the war when votes are in force in November.
When does Trump start tonight's Western Virginia event and where can be followed online?
Trump whiheeling (Négyat-Virginia) will begin today, i.e. on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 7 a.m. on East Time.
Trump's Western Virginia meeting can also be followed online through the live media of YouTube.
Trump is likely to be affected by his supreme legal candidate Brett Kavanaugh's weekly hearing, which was particularly tense in the light of sexual assault charges, and the Senate's vote of ratification was suspended for a maximum of one week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the sudden proliferating events is to help Republicans in the situation before the elections in November.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, the five events next week will be "a means of activation of voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently held in the Senate and the Assembly", says Reuters.
“The fact that you know the direction of the division in your hands is such a critical point in your political plans that the President will visit as far as possible into a state as possible. We are going to take a dense campaign period,” reported a campaign agent who called Reuters to silence his name.
Today’s event planned in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, entitled “You can also bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania States and even access media coverage in Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, for the second time in the last month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
It is trying to help the Senate candidate of the Republic of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been reported to be in a bad situation.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must personally act in order to be better involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team is full-blown in front of the Sunday individuals to keep hope alive.
After three one-sided attempts, the 4th match on Saturday afternoon needed the Ryder Cup very much.
The fluttering shirt of luck and moment here and there is a rather airy concept of sports, yet everyone believes in it, especially in competitions like the Ryder Cup.
So who has the ball now?
“They had a six-point drive, and they had only four benefits, so let’s say we have the ball right here,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
On the other hand, four points are still driving Europe, and twelve more can be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they finally got a little back, and they can draw encouragement from a number of things, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and they both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the end, and his performance was exemplary.
The sounding of the wild triumphant cry of victory was getting louder as it moved forward with the circle, invented and balanced by an excellent twist in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were double-sided after two.
The final draw of the game resulted in a shout of joy similar to the 15th round, a kind that can make the viewer believe that the American team is not lost yet.
“You just have to dig deep inside yourself and care only for your own business,” said Pieth.
This is exactly what is still waiting for players.
18 flaws for the chance that you too will leave a trail.
In the last two days only Francesco Molinari andby Fleetwood, the most popular couple of the Ryder Cup could score more points than Spieth and Tos.
It's strange, but a lot of the four of them are adorable, and they don't seem to be able to make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not perform on Saturday afternoons over the par, and on Saturday afternoons, on Friday afternoons and on Friday evenings during the last nine stages of the evening.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and between them and their supporter, they have become the standard by Sunday, and they expect no one to secure Europe's victory with the sun's receipt on the Le Golf Park track, such as Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be best to win at the same time with different holes.
However, the victory of Europeans could still be celebrated.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly executed by Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning when she was with Alex Noren.
Once and twice with two punches over the par, the Spanish and Swedish at the first nine holes, which pushed them into a wave where they had no chance of climbing out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to get me out of your hole.
The four-point games and the four-games are very entertaining from close thanks to the interaction between the couples. It can be observed who gives advice, what does not give, and how the strategy can change in a blink of sight.
Europe has already played a better team and has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section 4 has shown that the U.S. team has the cursing skills needed to fight, even though many of them are lacking, especially on the American side.
Europe will start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage.
Europe has a great advantage in starting the last day of the Ryder Cup after the four-legged and four-legged matches on Saturday ended with a 10-6 result against the United States of America.
The enthusiastic Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were leading the race to win two victorys against the weak Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf track.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the ever-falling American team during the four-ball match in the morning, winning the series to 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance during the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't stop the difference anyway.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in a series, while he and Molinari, who are only mentioned as "Melliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup, which reached four points in four opening games.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed couple in the four-legged, they beat the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. newbie Bryson Dechambii to a certain 5-4 with their great team play.
Woods, who dragged himself like that all the time this Saturday, did indeed still enjoy his talent, but out of 29 he lost 19 of the four-scores and four fours, seven of them in line.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the four-balls of the morning, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and in the four-quarters he was defeated 2 to 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third rank of the world’s most prestigious.
However, Europe has not succeeded in doing all of this pleasant, windy day south of here.
The triple-tier Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturdays showed the Americans how to do this.
A delicate 2-to-1 victory against the couples of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-legged, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-to-three ratios after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team managed to return from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions only twice, although a tie for Furyk's title team is enough to survive the trophy.
However, after having been the second best for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
‘It is impossible for North Korea to go unilaterally if it does not trust its negotiating partner.
In the United Nations on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea announced that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the mistrust of the United States of America, and there was no rule that under these circumstances the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear war.
Ringho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "important and ambitious steps" during the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile attempts, closing the site of nuclear experiments and promising that it would not expand its nuclear arsenal and nuclear technology application scope.
"Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans," he said.
– In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed and, under such circumstances, there is no way that we should go unilaterally and first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment at D.C.'s opposition to the idea of "several" nuclear fission, which, in the view of North Korea, would be rewarded for the actions that have been taken, her statement seemed to be significant, because it did not explicitly reject the unilateral nuclear decommissioning as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jongun and Donald Trump at the ever-ever first summit between a powerful President of the United States and North Korean leaders, which took place in Thailand on 12 June, and during which Kim promised that he would work on the "decommissionation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to make an official point at the end of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States believes that Phenjan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
D.C. did not allow any strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“He urges us to start with nuclear decommissioning and to increase the pressure to force us to do so, and he also denies the declaration of the end of the war, ” said Ri.
- The idea that sanctions can force us to kneel, is a desire for people who do not know us.
The problem is that non-mistakes only increase our suspicions."
Mrs. Ri did not mention that she would be planning a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, was specifically discussed by the US President in the UN at the beginning of the week.
The Minister pointed out that three meetings were held between Kim and South Korean President Mun Dzein in the last five months, adding: "If the country involved in nuclear fission were South Korea, not the United States of America, the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Party would not have been in such a situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the target of North America's continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable, since Trump, "the President of the Devil", called Kim "the rocketman who is going on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, paid tribute to Kim and said that he had the courage to take steps towards landing, but he also noted that there was still a lot of work to do, and that the sanctions will remain until North Korea does so.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit was set, that is, "if it takes two years, three years or five months, no matter what."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council could reward Kai for the actions that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, the American Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said in the United Nations Security Council: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly enforced until we have achieved the actual, definitive, proven nuclear decommissioning."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained the sanctions against North Korea in order to reintroduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rív during the UN General Assembly session, and then he said that next month he would return to Phenjan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed very well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea, hours later, accused him of producing with "Gygsterlike myths".
During the meeting with Munna this month, North Korea promised to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also "takes the right steps".
Mun stated that Kim's "steps" would be security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore or measures that could lead to the normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to take enough time to rest.
This year, the University of Harvard is a new study subject that has set students apart for more nights, also fighting against the mascot culture of all nights of learning heated by caffeine.
An academic concluded that students from the world's first university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, according to him, the first such training in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who trained in sleeping medicine at the Harvard University of Medicine, and trained as a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of a course to give a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep-taking on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked: ‘Why am I facing this as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep that surprised him," he told Telegraph.
During the first course launched this year, students are described by their students as the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep patterns on their educational and sports performance, apart from having a positive impact on their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard University of Medicine and Director of the University’s Health Service, the university decided to start the course because during the week students were found to be extremely unsuspecting.
The one-hour course also includes a number of interactive tasks.
One example shows a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gymnastics and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by sleeplessness and why it is important for bedtime routine.
In another part, participants are aware of how long-term sleep planning increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present an interactive map of the areas of the university, with interactive icons, that participants are being asked to reconsider the daily routine.
“We know that we will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to these knowledges, as you have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture that counts as a performance to learn a night, said, adding that modern technology and ever-growing pressure on students result in increasing problems of sleeplessness.
A pleasant and high-quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even from obesity, as sleep generation makes the brain hungry and causes a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop his course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he first took one of the professor's courses at Harvard.
He said that the people who heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to look at the launch of a university training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training programme before taking a position in the field of competition.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put up a warning for bed, a larvae for a nap, and familiarise themselves with the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily push them out of the daily rhythm and make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga will defeat Gerrard's men and pursue a goal.
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bombed Steven Gerrard's team slipped into 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxians tried to win their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in February, St. Johnstone, but Gerrard's second defeat has been the first to lose from Gary Holt's first team as manager in 18 days. Thus, eight points will be left behind from Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship) as their first lead in the Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before mid-term, and the Rangers' unmotivated team is not even yet available for equalisation.
While the Rangers slipped down to the sixth place, Livingston picked up on the third, just because of the difference in goal, remaining behind Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may face additional difficulties following medical treatment for Calum Spence's head injury due to an object likely to be dropped from the customer's sight.
Gerrard changed at eight points on the team that got into the Bentfed Cup's semifinal with the Ayr hit.
Dead on the same 11 people from Livingston who took a point away from Hearts last week and would certainly have been happy to watch his full-fledged team strangle his opponent's game wherever he reached.
Although the Rangers led in a volition, Livingston took him more than what he got.
They could have had a job in the first two minutes, when Menga first shot Scott Pittmant towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the middle man couldn't sell the chip.
Keaghan Jacobs's low-emission kick was landed at Craig Halkett, but his fellow defenseman, Alan Lithgow, only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but they had more hope in their game in the last third time than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be punished at the fifteenth minute when he confronted Steven Lawless, but Steven Thomson lost sight of his complaints in Colombia.
The Rangers were able to launch only two first mid-term gate shots, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, had little problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt was in the 34th minute facing the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers ran away again, again, a joke forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond at the time when Declan Gallagher poured the ball to Scott Robinson, who was happy to find Menga for easy completion.
Gerrad decided in the meantime, Coulibalyt Ryan Kentre replaced him, and that almost immediately explained the impact on the game when the extreme Morelost was hurled, but the impressive form was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to play the same game as it did, and Lithgow and Halt were swept up the long balls one by one.
Dead's team could have made a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and struck Jacobs' position before Lithgow explained it from an angle.
Glenn Middleton, who joined the Rangers in exchange for a change, tried to fight another 11 when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson was unable to convince him now.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter.
A detail of “Sunday Breakfast” from our almanach: 30.September 1882, now just 136 years... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that resulted in the creation of a device known as Geiger counters.
The Geiger Account has since become one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado", composed of K.A. Cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evanst, who are members of pop culture:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, a radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be found with it.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of the atoms released for the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Well, listen to me, it's rushing! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live on in his reputation as a reflector.
A new vaccine against cancer will teach the immune system how to "see" abnormal cells.
A new vaccine against cancer will teach the immune system to "stitch" and to detect abnormal cells.
A particular vaccine as part of a treatment teaches the body to detect abnormal cells.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then change them in a laboratory.
It is able to "see" the protein that is a variety of cancer escorts, and the treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has produced promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells could have given rise to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the recovery of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory is to "see" the protein HER2 which is a frequent accompanying factor in multiple cancers, and then the replanting of cells.
Jay Benzofsky, professor of the National Research Institute of the United States of America (Bethesda, Maryland), said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of many types of cancer,” explains Professor Berzofsky, including breast, ovary, lung and anal cancer.
A similar method, based on highlighting the immune cells and "teaching" them on how to attack cancer cells, has already been used to manage a type of leukaemia.
The role of Kanye West SNL, who wears the Maga cap, was peaked in a Trumpot Support Spear Tire.
It didn't work out very well.
Kanye West was snuffed out in the studio of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent manifestation in which he appreciated the American president of Donald Trump and informed him that he would challenge the presidential post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night in the cap of Make America Great Againe, Ghost Town, began to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trumpot.
“Many times when I talk to someone who is white, he asks: ‘How do you like Trumpo, because it’s racist?’
If you were interested in racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The Slä's show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which the Hollywood star-gull was fired by Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the sexual assault charges of Blasy Ford.
Although not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the video of the West Statement to social sites by a humorist named Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether the South was trying to make a joke out of West with the load.
He even complained to the audience that he was dragged behind the scenes for his hat.
“They were afraid behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
They're safe.
And they said that I was in the sunken place," said Washington Examer.
He continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape, because that means they can’t tell me what to do.
Work with love."
His manifestations were accompanied at least twice by a whistler from the audience, and SNL's actors seemed to have been embarrassed by one of the witnesses who reported to Variety: "The entire studio was silent in silence."
West was invited instead of singer Ariana Grande in the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper passed away a few days before.
He also asked questions when he wrote his I Love song dressed as a Perrier glass.
West, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, provided support in a story: "One of the bravest spirits: CREATY, HOW TO BE WORRYED."
Karen Hunter, host of a wedding show, said that West was simply "he was himself, and that's great."
“But I decided not to reward someone (by buying music or fashion goods or by supporting “art”), which I believe is an idea that is harmful to the community that I belong to.
I'm free.
But we also", he added.
Before the broadcast, rapper announced on the news that he changed his name, now he is “the creature known earlier as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's followed by Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Snoop Dog, his friend Snoop Dog, also recorded the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, the last legend, Prince changed his name to a thread, and then to the artist, whom he was known as Prince.
He's accused of attempted manslaughter of the infested restaurant late in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted manslaughter after a man has been delayed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast this Friday.
According to the police statement, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The prosecution is the D.A.'s investigation.
Kit Harington, the star of the battle of the Thrones, considers the experiential manhood to be harmful.
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow, the Battle of the Thrones, and in HBO's violent, middle-aged fantasy, he himself often holds a sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke against the stereotypical mascot heroes, pointing out that such heroes have often seen young boys feel that tough action is needed to combat respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, he said that "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of overweight in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently took away his also 31-year-old serial colleague, Rose Leslie, told me that he thought it was very important to remedy the problem.
“I am personally deeply affected by this matter, ” asked the actor, “how did the representation of manhood become so distorted? ”
– What did we teach men when they were young about the problem we are facing?"
Who says the television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of man, as shows often feature very masculine characters.
He added: “What was it that was born with us, and what was it that we were learning?
What does the road and TV mean to young boys, which makes them think only men can do this?
I think this is one of the big issues of our day – and how we can change this.
Because it is obvious that something is not right with young men."
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer end of the series, the thrones will not be included in the Harca advance series or in the course of events because “there is a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
From November Kit Sam Shepard True West will play a key role in the reprocessing of his film, which is about a producer and his brother who lives in a riding lifestyle.
The artist told me that the best thing he got from the Battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, who he knew while he was doing the show.
“On the stage, I met my wife, including my future family and my life before me,” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was the character of Kit, Jon Snow, had his love in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: In recent times, the number of new patients has increased by 14%.
He announced that the country had increased the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
Officials believe that this represents more than 820 000 activities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared with the previous, it has changed that a large majority of newly infected people are sexually affected.
The disease has spread rapidly through blood transfusions in some parts of China at a time.
However, veterinary officials at a conference in the province of Julien reported that the number of such cases had fallen nearly to a low level since then.
Nevertheless, compared with last year, the number of HIV and AIDS live in Libya increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
On the basis of estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are married to a woman due to the conservative value of the country.
In these relationships, the disease is in some cases related to inappropriate sexual protection.
The Chinese Government has since 2003 provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of a programme to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his crew would have leaked Republican Senators' data and condemned the "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories".
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters rejected on Saturday the charges that one of his staff published personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators’ Wikipedia page.
According to the L.A. Democratic Representative, these claims were presented to experts and web sites on the "best right" of these claims.
“Silence, lies and even more gross lies,” Waters wrote on the truth.
The information provided is said to have included the address and telephone number of the Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, as well as Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Tutah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday. The public person is unknown, but it is certain that they were published on the Capitol hill during the Senate hearing of the Senate of the Supreme Court candidate for sexual harassment in Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaking occurred shortly after the three senators asked for Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, are linked to Waters' office as a source of identifiable IP address, and data were also provided from a member of Waters' team, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false,” continued Waters.
- My crew members are not responsible for leaking information. However, their right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been compromised by fraudulent and lying charges.
These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false."
Waters' statements were quickly accompanied by criticisms on the Internet. Among the criticisms were Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“It’s a large apostasy,” wrote Fleischer.
- Based on this, it seems that Waters does not have the blood temperature required for his representative's office.
If someone suspects something he didn't do, he can't hurt him.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Waters' reaction to Fleischer seems to have been compared by Judge Kavanaugh to his reaction to some of the criticisms of the Democratic Party, who, according to some critics, seemed too upset at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the seat of representative of Waters in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on the news.
“If true, then this is serious,” he wrote.
Waters in his statement wrote that his office had notified the "adequate authorities and police bodies" in the case of false accusations.
“We are convinced that the person who committed the crime will be identified,” continued Waters, and that they will be legally responsible for all the acts that threaten or threaten any member of my staff.”
English will strike again, or Rowan Atkinson's sneering spy game will strike again.
It has now become a premise that we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and this cannot be the exception of the feature of Johnny English, which is a feature of the action game/papodia category, the first part of which, in 2003, and the second part of Johnny English, which was recharged in 2011, went into the cinema.
Will the British nation's new export product become the sarcastic parading satyrs in which we live in our own obvious parading?
It is certain that the trash is rigid, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has had enough ambiguity for another return – from its name it is clear that this comic character was created to be made by the crowds of people in cinemas in non-English countries of the world.
English Johnny English is of course an unsuspecting secret agent, who thinks he's a little suspicious with his weird manners, so he looks a bit like Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and sometimes the guy who contributed a single key print to the performance of the main theme of the Firecrees at the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics in 2012.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once, who has been on a long-standing Barclaycard TV commercial and who has left a mess everywhere.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English film.
I loved it when Johnny dressed in English medieval armor, he approached a helicopter, and then the rotors were knocking on his helmet for a few moments.
The comical vein of Atkinson is well established in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it also seems super-fluous, since these days, such as the James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are also bravely attached to the humor weapon.
To think that the film’s humor rather targets children, and to me Johnny English’s flawed, failed adventurers do not reach the level of reason and genius that Atkinson brings in in Mr. Bean’s musical silent scenes.
The starting point for the film is permanent: Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercrime broke into the network of the British spy network's super secret online network and revealed the identity of all the British agents to the greatest fear of Agent Kevin Eldon, who, by the way, got just one small part of the film.
This may be the last angle to the coffin of the arrogant and sharing Prime Minister whose political popularity is, by the way, in ruins: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and makes everything out of the character that is otherwise poorly written.
The intelligence consultant will advise him that, as all active agents have turned out to be, he has to put an agent on the job.
This retired agent, of course, is the double-handed Johnny English, who has worked as a high school teacher since his retirement, but he teaches children to be espionage - there are, of course, funny scenes here, while he describes the basis for espionage as a form of "Rocksuli".
English is quickly transported to White Hall, where at the emergency briefing you will meet again with your previous long-standing arms carrier, Bough, who is now being modified by Ben Miller.
Bough has since married, and has taken over a captain of a seagoing ship, who always has a earful mouth — the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is designed for far better roles.
So the two-armed "Batman and Robin" pair of His Majesty's National Security Service is back in action and is faced with Ophelia Bulletova, who is a woman of true destiny acting by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly being caught up by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the UK's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is being shaped by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their clown mission: they'll set fire to a coup d'état, then, in the midst of an amazing upheaval, smuggle themselves into the starcht of Volta, and English will actually free hell when you're trying to get to know her apartment using a VR-head.
These stations need us to get to the finish line, but whatever joy and urgency we've been able to achieve, it may cause a little too much impact on a child's film.
The result is quite medium.
As with all the other Johnny English films, the question has just been raised: can't the British film industry finally play a valuable role in Rowan Atkinson?
The British Working Party denies that it would take a day's job to take a day's job while paying the Brits a day's salary.
Jeremy Corby's working party is working on a radical draft: on the day-to-day work week, with employees working for five-day wages.
The party claimed that it would also like workers to receive an extra day off for workers due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (M) due to increased income.
On the basis of the draft, workers would receive a three-day weekend while taking as much home as they had before.
As a result, the idea would be "be" for the party's economic programme, which aims to remove the language of the balance sheet on the employee's side in the country.
The idea of a day-to-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Association, which suggests that workers could also benefit from the changing economy.
One of the chief officials of the Labour Party commented to the Sunday Times: “The policy review may be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen one day to another, the four-day week work week is an idea that fits well into the party's programme that would settle the figure's language in the economy and also fit into the party's comprehensive industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party was already in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a working week on a day's work week.
The idea, however, does not enjoy supporting the Work Party as a whole.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party commented: “The working week of the day is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the question is not even on the agenda.”
Mr John McDonnell, shadow finance minister, presented his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour Party Conference.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from the "mightless directors" and the "potentials" of the companies.
If the shadow finance minister had plans, the shareholders of water supply companies would not be able to recover the full profits they would receive, because a government in the labour market would be ‘reductions’ as a liability for the harmful activities that they were suspected.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to become a member of the board of directors, and would create Inclusive Property Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, who would receive 500 important dividends this year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy were told in the programme "60 Minutes" whether the investigation concerning Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
As a result of the investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Judge will be held at least a week later than the date of the original investigation.
In an interview with the 60 Minutes Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether they could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was less committed than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
- That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the case went off, after the charges came up, and asked, “Did you do it?”
His answer was firm and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete-proof.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and would need extremely serious charges to change my mind, ” said Graham.
– Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied claims – she added it to Graham, Blasey Ford.
- And no one named by Dr. Ford has justified the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new would come out."
What is a Global Civil Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday in New York, the annual music event, the Global Civil Festival, will begin. World stars will perform at the festival to pursue a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens' Festival is now being organized, it is expected to be filled with tens of thousands of the Great Central Park Basin, where participants will not only be able to perform the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also be able to draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest group aimed at eliminating poverty by involving more and more people in the fight against poverty.
Those who undertake to carry out certain tasks or “business” such as voluntary work, sending e-mails to a leading politician, a telephone call or any other valuable activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project, such as the eradication of poverty, can receive free tickets to the concert (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets).
But how successful has the Global citizen been for the last 12 years in achieving the objectives set?
Is it really an effective means to reward people with a concert sign to believe others in the importance of action, or is it just another form of "clichtivism", when people feel that they have actually contributed to a matter by signing or writing a Twitter message on an online petition?
Since 2011, global citizens have reported that more than 19 million "acts" have been carried out by project promoters, which have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to the allocation of $37 billion by world leaders to poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that they came from their actions, of which 10 billion dollars were already paid or collected during the fundraising process.
According to the group estimates, the total money was already directly involved in the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a partnership between investors and investors in the United States with the aim of ‘helping children reach their potential’. The organization promised Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eliminate the hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from ‘global citizens’.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, and of donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we will banish social injustice and malnutrition as part of the biography footnotes,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, on a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions have been requested to improve the food supply of mothers and their children, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food supply of 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions recently on the website of the Global citizen is: "Why do you think poverty can be eradicated?"
According to the Global Citizens’ answer: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes to catch up and sometimes to fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation changes, we also achieve our goal because we are alike stronger."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be performing this year's New York event, and the event will be Deborah-Lee Viennes and Hugh Jackman.
Minister for Interior: the United States would use a military "block" to prevent Russian energy exports.
"if necessary", Washington would use even the Navy to combat the introduction of Russian energy products on the market, such as the Middle East, which would not allow the Russian energy to go to the Middle East," quoted U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, Washington Examer, quoted by U.S. Minister of Interior.
Zinke claims that the active presence of Russia in Syria, in particular as regards the Russian transaction requested by the Supreme Syrian Government, is only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Minister for the Interior, there is a method to prevent the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure that maritime routes are open and can also block them if necessary, so it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke addressed to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
In his speech, Washington compared his action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned in an economically similar manner: using existing energy resources and introducing new ones,” said Zinke, while calling Russia “one-dimensional economy”, pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil energy sources.
The conclusions coincide with the plan of the Government of the Trade to export LNG to Europe, excluding Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
Therefore, the Directors of the Trump Government, including the President himself, are willing to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfair" route called North Stream 2, which, if it takes place, will make Germany "a hostage".
He pointed out more than once that the 2 wires of the North Stream of $11 billion, which doubles the existing capacity, increasing to 110 billion cubic metres, are exclusively economical projects.
According to the Kremlin, the D.N.A. is so fiercely opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the same view that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely,” said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak following a September meeting with Rick Perry US Minister for Energy in Moscow.
The attempt to convince the Americans has taken place backwards, because Germany has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI) called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy, as well as to refrain from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third country interferes with our energy issues,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation (BDI), following the last meeting of Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Warren Massachusetts “seriously considering” that he should start for the presidency in 2020.
Senator Warren Masachusetts said that after the mid-term elections, "she will seriously consider running for the presidency".
In Warren Massachusetts, a town meeting in Holyoke in Holyoke, he confirmed that he would consider starting the project.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and put the poor functioning government in order, and it is also time for a woman to be the president,” said Warren The Hill.
– After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for the presidency."
At the city meeting in Warren's criticism, he had Donald Trumpot and said that he said he would “take the country the wrong way. ”
“I note with serious concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” said Warre.
Mr. President, Mr. Trumpot and Mr. Brett Kavanaugh were explicitly critical of the Supreme Court candidate for the Trumpot and Mr. Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren wrote in a Twitter message on Friday, "but, of course, there is a need for a firm investigation before the vote."
However, on the basis of a survey of a Thursday, most of Warren's votes in Massachusetts do not believe that Warren should be running for the presidency in 2020 .
On the basis of a survey of the University of Suffolk's Political Analyst and the Boston Globe, 58% of the voters voting "good chance" of Warrenre said that the senator should not be running for the presidency, while the senator should not go for the presidency.
32% of them support Warren's presidential election.
On the basis of the survey, the President-in-Office of former Governors of Deval Matt would be supported by a majority, 38%, and 48% of them would be opposed.
Among other things were the names of high-ranking democratic politicians, such as Joe Biden's former vice-president or the Australian Senator Bernie Sanders, during the elections in 2020.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden will decide until January whether to start.
Sarah Palin Track Palin referred to her PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting.
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after being in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night.
“As my father goes through what he goes through when he comes home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of the PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” said Sarah Pulin to the audience in Donald Trump Oklahoma, in her meeting in New York.
He called the arrest of Palin’s son “the elephant in the room” and said that his son, like the rest of the war veterans, “returned, hard-wired, and constantly wondering if he would give due regard to the service that all the friends, the pilots and all the other members of the army did for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla in Alaska for domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, the spokesperson of the Wasilla Police said that Track Palin, according to a report, was armed and committed domestic violence.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of asylum policy.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new American asylum policy, which provides that those who flee from gang violence or domestic violence are not protected.
On Friday, an expert letter was sent from representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. to Washington to support an ambulance who attacks the policy in court, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant for the case of Grace vs. Sessions, initiated against the Federal Court of Justice by the Union of American Citizens' Rights in August, was not published.
The applicant woman claims that her partner and "sons of a violent crime" attacked her, but on 20 July, American officials rejected her application for asylum.
She's being held in custody.
The prosecutors of the States supporting Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have been described as places from which a lot of asylum to the United States comes, since violence by criminals and domestics is a problem in these countries.
The new U.S. asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the 2014 Committee on the Appeal of Immigrants (BIA) to lodge an asylum application against domestic violence of non-documented immigrants who had not been granted documents.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General, stated in a Friday's notice that the new policy "is to be ignored by several national, federal and international law of the country."
"All applications under federal law must be considered, where applicable, in the facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle violates this principle", says the letter of the Advocate General.
In addition, the prosecutors explained in the letter that the policy against immigration harms the American economy, because immigrants are more likely to become a contractor and “fill the lowest level of jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the security officers not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and escape from criminal gangs.
“The right of asylum is a matter of nationality, religion, national nationality, belonging to a particular social group or of serious fear of persecution or political belief,” said Sessions on 11 June of the decision, “For reasons of racial, religious, national origin, belonging to a particular social group or for reasons of political belief”.
Asylum law has not been invented to solve all of people’s daily problems worldwide, be they as serious as they may be.
A desperate rescue action in Palu, the number of dead persons doubled, rescue procedures are running a race over time.
The survival situation is becoming more and more pressing.
“ Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while her feverous little boy is calming down in a disaster-stricken center in Paru’s escape center.
- The ambulance will bring the bodies from one minute to the next.
We don't have much drinking water."
Some of the residents have returned to their homes and destroyed their homes so that they can save what is still available.
Several hundreds of victims have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by the earthquake with a height of 7.5, do not convince people to take care of them.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harist, who had a broken back and shoulder, were brought to the Palu Military Hospital, and the patients were provided outside the body for severe post-convulsions.
The man’s eyes filled with tears when he remembered as the fifth-storey hotel room, where he and his wife and daughter were obsessed with it, was shaken into the devastating earthquake.
“There was no time to flee.
I think I got caught in the fell walls – said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family came to town for a wedding.
- I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador is accusing China of invading the country with propaganda advertisements.
The U.S. Ambassador accused Beijing of making a promotion in the US press, which happened one week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of US-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called for the announcement of the press in China Daily Des Moines Register, the largest edition of Iowa, while accusing China of trying to intervene in the American Congress elections on 6 November. China denies the charge.
Trump claims that Beijing is trying to intervene in the American elections, according to some U.S. officials who comment to the Reuters, it is a new stage in the efforts of Washington against China, which is intended to put China under pressure.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an ever more intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, where new customs duties are imposed on imports of each other.
According to American and Chinese experts at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese customs duties in response tried to target exporters from countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa, for example.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador and the former Iowa governor of the United States over a period of several cycles, stated that China has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses, because the Iowa State is exporting significant agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the January Des Moines Register that "China is further agitating our country by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“The government of the PRC takes advantage of the great American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of expression,” said Branstad.
– however, if we go to a peking press, we can find some very critical articles. The Chinese press does not really reflect the different views of the Chinese people on the ever-larger growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under close control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “one of China’s most popular journalists refused to bring him down”, but did not name the newspaper.
It is estimated that the Republics can dispose of female voters before the mid-term elections by the Kavanaugh Journal.
It is estimated that many high-level Republican politicians may take the lead in the cross-referencing of sexual assault charges, including the highest court candidate in Brett Kavanaugh, and in particular women's voters may lose their support before mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn – says Grant Reeher, a politologist at the Maxwell School of the University of Syria, on one of the Saturdays of The Hill.
Mr. Reeher expressed his doubts about the fact that the censure proposed at the last minute by the Republic of Jeff Flake by the Arizona Senator of the Republic of Arizona will be sufficient to reassure the voters of the vote.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – either tomorrow or November,” said a Washington, D.C.-survey, Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic’s guidance, a few protestors in the Senate Hall this morning said, “The November to the day,” because despite the statement by Dr. Blasy Ford, under the control of the Republic, the Committee on Justice decided not to withdraw the nomination of Kavanaugh.
“It will be an incredible leap of democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” he said to the news, Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Many say that it has already been extremely high, and that is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters and young people (18-29 years old) in the suburbs, who, although they do not like the president, often do not go to vote."
Analysts have already assumed before Ford's public announcement that they could come back to Republicans if they continue to stand up to Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in detail in his statement why he is accusing the Supreme Court candidate with sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong about the soil,” said the NBC News at the beginning of last week, former President of the Republican National Commission, Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Commission.
"It is not just a Commission vote and a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also the way the Republics handled the matter and acted with Ford," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States of America for the election of the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been quite shared to see whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is a little more likely to believe than Ford.
According to YouGov's new survey, 41% of respondents believed in Ford's statement, and 35% of respondents gave the same answer to Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents say that Kavanaugh is likely to have lied to her, while only 30% of Ford believed that.
According to Flake's motion, the FBI is currently examining the credibility of Ford's claims, as is the case with another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
Ford swore under oath a week ago before the Senate Justice Committee that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh was intoxicating him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genital organ at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
An inventor of the world network would launch a new internet to confront Google and Facebook with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Last project of the technology industry, Inrupt is a company based on the Solid, an open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Soliddal users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee believed that the intention behind the Inrupt was to “take over the world to rule over it. ”
“Now we have to do it,” he said about the go-ahead.
- It's a historic moment."
The use of Solid makes it possible for people to create their own "personal online repository" or "POD".
This may include lists, tasks lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available from the same web browser at the same time.
In a personal online repository, it is unique for a user to decide in full who can access its data.
This is what the company calls "the exercise of its self-righteous power over data for individuals".
John Bruce, Executive Director of Inrupt, says that the company is responsible for ensuring resources, processes and the right skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of a security platform purchased from Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM, some of the contractors involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, world technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the Inrupt website's devices.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not asking "Facebook and Google to introduce complete change-making technology, which one day would put business models of companies on top of their heads."
"We do not request permission."
In a post published on the medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt "is the provision of commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solidra."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he established the World Wide Web consortium at the University of Technology in Massachusetts.
Berners-Lee has participated in the debate on net neutrality in recent months as an important voicer.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite the launch of the Inrupt.
“I am absolutely optimistic about the next age of the world network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann is a first - world minister in the World War I of the Victorian Cross, celebrated.
The only Victoria crucifix was given to the English minister’s festivities 100 years after he executed his refugee in World War I.
Honorary Honorary Officer Bernard Vann and Colonel Colonel deserved the award during the bellenging and Lehacourt attack of 29 September 1918.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper so he could never know that he deserved the highest award of the British armed forces.
Two of the grandchildren of an accident to honour were exposed at the Saturday celebration in Urhden in Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "symbolically important" was given after exactly 100 years of his grandfather's act of honor.
According to the District of London, on 29 September 1918, Honorary Lord and Colonel Bernard Vann and Colonel, on 29 September 1918, he carried through the Canal de Saint-Quent's channel "in the midst of a dense fog and a fierce cannon and machine fire".
Later on, he rushed into style and "extraordinary heroism" was at the top of the board of the flag, and then he was alone in an attack on a side cannon task force, three members of him, without any harm.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper was shot by Mr Bernard Vann and the L.A. on 4th of October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility,” said his grandfather, 72-year-old Michael Vann.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also co-pressed by the attack stone.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was an honor to play a part in the celebration and added: “A true hero’s complaint shows how many people later express their respect.”
The MMA fans have been jolting all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast, instead of receiving Peppa pig.
Imagine that all night long he was alarming me to see the new Bellator 206, and this transmission is not going to happen.
The San José programme had 13 encounters, six of which were broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom as part of the main competition programme on Channel 5 channel in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, the watchers in England did not have a surprise instead of the fight on the show.
Many of them were hit by difficulties that remained up until the morning hours because of the same conflict.
The biography that was removed instead of MMA Meccas has been described by one of the fans as "a kind of sick joke" on the news.
“According to public law, this kind of content can no longer be broadcast by the canal at 6 a.m. and should therefore have been converted into child programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, head of the Communication and Marketing Department of Bellator’s communications and marketing department.
- Yeah, it's Perppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator Company, promised that in the future, the programme's schedule would be revised in such a way as to take into account the United States viewers.
“I think that we can certainly solve this once again,” Coker said.
- However, since it is 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, until our time Sunday, which we already have on Monday, we cannot cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show went through, a lot of messages came in, and, well, most of it wasn't exactly friendly.
First, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to make it right.
But that's not what we were talking about. We were dealing with a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that next time it won't happen, it won't happen.
There are only five matches in the program instead of the six so far – we would very much like to make room for the viewers, but we've accounted for ourselves.
It was a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discussion: Tom Daley due to his sexual orientation in dealing with a minority complex with the Tom Dalele minority complex.
Tom Daley's fake jumper at the Olympics said that, at an early age, he felt superior to everyone in his life because of his sexual orientation, but that's how he demonstrated his motivation to succeed.
According to a 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like him".
On Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, he told director Lauren Laverne that he stood up for the right of gay people to give others a "hope".
He added that since he became a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent programme host for a long period of years, missed several months due to illness.
In the first performance of Laverne, Daley invited me as a "shipwrecker" to say that when young, she felt less than anyone else because "it was not socially accepted if someone loved boys and girls as well."
He said: “Today, it is a feeling of superiority and proximity that I draw endurance and strength from to achieve my success.”
He was trying to prove that he too was “anything” so as not to disappoint anyone when he was exposed to sexual insanity.
The double Olympic Bronze Jumper has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and has requested the governments of the world to decriminalise homosexuality in as many countries as possible in this year's participation in national community games in Australia.
He said he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life in the first place without negative consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others as well.
The three-time world champion said that "it was a complete surprise" when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker whom he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and her Honorary Judge, who was 20 years old, joined together last year, and claims that the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you go through so much in your young age,” he said, “he was 14 years old at the first Olympics, and your father died of cancer three years later,” you will find it difficult to find in his own age a person who had similar extremisms.
In June, a little boy was adopted by Robert Ray Black-Daley, who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley's own decision was that it completely upsets his attitude towards the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is that I had a rifle,” he said.
But you know what I figured out?
My Olympic Armour Robbie."
Her child's name is Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after having been diagnosed with brain tumors.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of the most recent questions was whether there were tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he was sitting there in the first row.
“I was unable to answer him,” he quoted, “Dad, you will no longer be there in the first line.”
“I touched his hand when his breathing stopped, but until now I couldn’t accept that my father was not inviolable,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and gained the bronze.
“I realized that this is what I’ve been dreaming about all my life: jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Pure) has helped her in the preparations for the Olympics, and today she's going to be gay if she hears it.
Desert Island Lessons Sunday, local time starts at 11:15 on the BBC Radio 4 show.
Mickelson was not in shape, and on Saturday, the Ryder Cup was put on my bench.
The U.S. Phil Mickelson may set a record by attending the Ryder Cup Sunday on May 47th, but he must regain his form if he does not want to have this milestone as an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mr. Mickelson's record is presented in figures for the 12th time at the two-year event on Saturday's four-legged and four-legged games, but Captain Jim Furyk sent it to your brother-in-law.
Instead of being at the centre of events in the five winners of the big competitions, as is the case many times when it was necessary to fight for the victory of the United States, this one half of the day the team is cheering up its team and the other half is working on the course and trying to correct mistakes that weaken its game.
At the top of his career, he was never one of the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really lie in the narrow track of Le Edmonton, where, because of the high grass, he has to pay a very high price for the wrong hits.
And if the course alone would not be scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the exact Francesco Molinari English champion at Sunday’s fourth game, who won all four games this week in the team of Tommy Fleetwood, who was the first to start.
If Americans starting with a four-point back before the 12-person match start hard, then Mickelson's game can be decisive.
Furyk claims to trust the player, but what else could he say?
“You are fully aware of the role played in today’s development. You beat my back, scratched me, and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
– You are extremely confident.
It's one of the biggest, and it's done a lot for the team in the past and in the past and the past week.
In principle, I didn't give him two fights.
I have planned more, but in the circumstances, we have decided that this is the best way to do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
With Mr. Mickelson's Sunday performance, Nick Faldo's record will be defeated, with more matches than anyone has ever played in the Ryder Cup.
This will allow you to close a series of Ryder Cups that are far behind the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draw, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player would also have incomprehensible benefits for the team.
“Crying, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others,” explained a great team member.
- I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and that's good to see.
His presence goes beyond the strictly played game."
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, is aware that it is easy to obtain their benefits.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjørn, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup's individual matches, you can easily turn your back on it.
The Danish player showed up in a 1997 Valderramai match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans and then, at the end of the year, it was only able to win a stake in the odds of the winner of the Seve Ballesteros.
“We must always remind ourselves that we did not gain much advantage in Valderrama, but we won only with a hairline, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn, the pictured Bjørn, after the 5-3th Friday and last night victory in 2018 leading to 10-6 on Le Golf’s track.
- We've been thinking about previous years' competitions, and everyone can see that the game isn't over.
You have to play with full force tomorrow.
Come on, and do everything in your power to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is all we need to achieve, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
As I have said before, I am most concerned with 12 players on our team, but we must also pay attention to the other side, which happens to be one of the world's biggest players."
Bjørn, who is proud of the team’s performance on a difficult track, added: “I would never worship predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a different day.
Then everything is based on individual performance, which is completely different from a team game.
It's great to play in a couple when things are going well, but when you're standing up on your own, you'll find out in every way how courtship really is.
This must be explained to the players that tomorrow they will make the best out of themselves in the field tomorrow.
They must break away from their partners, who will also have to make the best of them."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent's team, confidently trusts that its players will perform better individually than in doubles, except for the doubles of Jeg Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
According to Furyk, he has experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then he was on the losing side after the smooth performance of the European team as a "Medinah work".
“I remember all the damn words, ” he replied, “when he was asked, since before the last day he encouraged the players Ben Crenshaw team captain in 1999.
- We have 12 important jobs tomorrow, but we have a quick start as much as we can in Brookline, as we have seen in Medinah.
If one of the teams is really down, it will put huge pressure on opponent players in the middle games.
Accordingly, we have compiled the order and prepared our players to perform a true miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the efforts to reverse the job, and Rory McIlroy will fight the first match, and then, in turn, Paulgt, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will come as the front half of the European team.
“I have decided on the order, because I think that this is how the picture works from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual act.
The transfer of Germany's latest warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's latest fleet should have been set up in 2014 to replace the warships of the Great Cold War, but because of the various system failures and the extremely rising costs, this would still wait for itself at least next year.
The opening of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg Fleet Flagship, the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, was postponed by the first half of 2019, writing the Die Zeit weekly in response to one of the military's spokespersons.
According to the ship's initial plans, it should have joined the Navy's commitment in 2014, but the continuous delays made it difficult for the big project to happen in 2014.
The Navy had ordered the four Baden-Württemberg ships in 2007 to replace the Bréme-style ageing frigate.
We know that it will have a high-fire cannon and that it will be equipped with missiles and disguised technology against various air and water vehicles, including a signal medicine that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signals of the ship.
Its additional important feature is that it is less accessible to care, which in practice means that these newest frigades can be placed in service for up to two years away from the mother's shelters.
However, due to the ongoing slide of the project, these high-tech warships with which Germany might be able to sense its power overseas may already be obsolete when they are finally allowed to serve, noted Die Zeit.
The heavy-duty F1-5 frigated last year when the German Navy officially rejected the launch of the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss factory in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent back a cargo ship to the manufacturer.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media has a number of critical "software and hardware" errors that render the warship unusable for a battle mission.
The comprehensive deficiencies will be a major issue, since only 120 ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will serve only half of the crew of the old Bréma class Frogs.
It has also been shown that the ship is extremely important, which is damaging its performance, and it is impossible for the Navy to make further changes.
The 7,000 tonnes of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships that the Germans made up in the World War II war.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in the overall project cost, including training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
In fact, according to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an incredible amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the original draft calculated EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with new frigs are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany's presence at sea is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, President of the German Parliament's National Committee, has recently admitted that the Navy "is trying to run out of warships in good condition".
According to the civil servant, the problem has in the meantime become an alarming process, since the old ships had to be disengaged, but there are no more vessels to replace the landings.
He expressed his concern at the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigades have even been able to join the Navy's bond.
The National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats.
New research is under way on a Scottish-league estate to find out how bats exploit the characteristics of the landscape during hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single-fly mammals, which may also benefit from future plant protection initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behaviour of ordinary and soprano dwarfs, as well as brown long-term bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden, West Ross.
At the appropriate points in the area, an operational interceptor shall be set up to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will perform mobile data collection with hand-held detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound of the recordings can be used to determine the frequency of the dents and which species is doing just what they are doing.
Researchers will also draw up an asylum map and a report to determine in detail how animal behaviour will change depending on the map.
Robwar, the NTS conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which bats are the most important habitats and which species use them.
This information helps to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the design of cracks, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other relevant species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has decreased significantly over the last century.
The foundations and regional development work interferes with animal sleepplaces and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and public information are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with paper issued, certain chemical procedures for building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not completely blind.
But because of what they were, they rely more on their hearing when they hunt for the preaching, rather than their vision.
They can define the exact status of insects and the areas to be sent by means of a sophisticated method based on the reaction to ultrasound.
NTS, which has more than 270 historical buildings worldwide, is responsible for the security of 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They work with ten skilled professionals who conduct regular studies and sleep examinations and take part in rescue work at times.
The organisation created the first and only dedicated bat serving in Scotland on three branches in Dumfries and Galloway, which provide home to eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
David Thompson is responsible for managing the area as an ideal place for bats to live in.
“Here in Threeves have a great place for bats,” he said.
- there are old buildings, many old trees, and everything else necessary for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other areas, we can learn more about what they need to have a good time."
It also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as the single establishment's entry could lead to the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
Bats are banned from being protected by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also requested the help of the public.
He said: “We still have a lot of things we don’t know about bats and the situation of most domestic populations.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape in connection with violence, lawyers are suing against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo cited the charges of sexual violence against him, who thinks that others are trying to use his name to "get into public knowledge".
Soccer lawyers are ready to sue the German newspaper Der Giegel, who brought the charges down.
The member of the Portuguese framework and the battle of the Juventus have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the inspector paid her $375 000 to listen to the case, wrote by Der Giegel on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo, after the charges were brought to light a few hours after he was released, reported in a live video to 142 million-dollar wardens that the news was “a lie. ”
“No, no, no, no and no.
The things that happened today about me are all lies," he told the camera the five-time goldball player.
“To use my name to get into public knowledge, he is trying to use it.
I'll tell you the truth.
They want to become famous with my name, like the life of public figures.
I am a happy man, and my life is fine," added the player with a smile.
As a result of the claims called “unacceptable suspicion of privacy”, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Advocate General Christian Sertz, the player will submit a claim for compensation "to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the infringement for the damage caused, which is likely to be one of the most serious infringements of the rights of the person committed in recent years."
The case was supposed to be in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in a club in the night, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone up to the sportsman's suite, where the man was an anally raped woman, is in the documents submitted to the state's attorney's office in Clark, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and said that he was a "good boy in percentages", except for a "one percentage".
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he felt that this had happened with a joint agreement.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police, and he also made a vision of his injuries in a hospital, but later he went to an out-of-court agreement because he "was afraid of retaliation" and "published humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the Agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life miserable.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was in the process of re-construction (from Real Madrid to the United Team) and this summer, the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for $100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will “everlastingly treat” the loss of car plants.
The United Kingdom will “everlast” if after Brexit loses its world-leading motor vehicle manufacturing position, said Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark.
He added: “serious” to the declaration made by the Tokyo UK to the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, the motor vehicle factory will be forced to temporarily stop production in the manufacturing plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese car company, in the case of a Brixit without an agreement, jobs may be lost due to delays in the event of a delay.
In the case of vehicles produced last year, the Burnstani factory producing the Ayoto Auris and Avens models produced 150 000 cars, 90 % of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
“I believe that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place in the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota brunette.
Other car suppliers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have expressed their concern about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, he claimed that Brixit would close the Oxford plant of the manufacturer of Minik for one month after a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risk associated with the supply chain in case of a Brexit without an agreement.
The Tokyo production line works on a "sympathy-time" basis, with parts arriving at 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without a agreement on 29 March, the disruptions at the border may, according to the industry's representatives, lead to delays in production and loss of part.
According to Toyot, it would be impossible to store enough spare parts for more than a day in the plant in Derbyshire, and production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that theresa May Chequers, known as “The plan for future relations with the EU”, “is precisely designed to avoid late checks at the border.”
We want an agreement under the best possible conditions that will not only benefit us from our current successes, but also new opportunities – he said in his BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
– Not only in Tokyo, but also in other producers, we are certainly in a position to maintain our very successful supply chain at present."
Toyota could not tell us how long production would stand, but warned that the additional costs could, in the long term, damage the competitiveness of the factory, which could eventually result in the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Ts Republicris, who has worked for 24 years in the brunette plant and is currently active on behalf of the Unite Trade Union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: "I have learned that we will never get back jobs that will end at that time."
One government spokesperson commented: "We have developed a comprehensive and feasible plan for future EU relations."
You can postpone the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein, announced by the White House.
The meeting of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump can be postponed for another week, as the debate on the Supreme Court candidate of Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian elections, the possible relations between the Tump consultant and the Russian Government, and the possible obstacles to justice by Tump.
In these months, they have been wondering if Trump will eventually lose the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk.
According to this monthly report by the New York Times, Rosenstein considered that he would arrive at the meeting on wire to record the discussion with the President, and the question was also raised as to whether, on the basis of the 25th Amendment, it would be possible to replace Trump on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the statements.
However, last Monday he visited the White House last week, and there was a rumor that he was going to file his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with the Party, which then had an appearance before the United Nations in New York City, was introduced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he would "not be happy" to approach Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not conflict with the Senate's judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and one woman, Dr. Blasy Ford, who has been the suspect of sexual offense, also testified by Dr. Blasy Ford.
On Friday, Trump commissioned a one-week investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has been visiting Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We have yet to set a date, even for this week, but I can see a chance of another week’s delay in the light of the Supreme Court cases.
It will come out, and I, as always, will inform the press."
However, journalists doubted the statement: Mr Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programme Chris Wallace also asked about this reason.
Sanders replied that the lack of press conferences was not the reason for his opposition to the behaviour of media reporters as "sacrifices", but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are truly sensational desires."
It then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and the press will take place more often than before.
"The President will give you more interviews than any previous president," he said. He added, even without justifying the claim: "We looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, however, “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is better to speak to me by light years than to speak to me directly.
We often try to do this, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so you can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly responds to reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with the attractions.
However, the ongoing press conferences are quite rare.
Why, that may be the result of what happened this week when the President of New York has produced an irregular and, in some cases, odd contribution to the assembly of journalists.
The Head of the Health Carrier sent a letter to the EU staff of NHS Scotland for concerns about Brexit.
The Head of the Health Carrier provided a letter of thanks to the Scottish NHS for its staff from the countries of the European Union and stressed that it hoped that it would remain beyond Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK is expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs related to settled status claims made by EU citizens engaged in a decentralised public service.
Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued, which is expected to result in a decision to be taken in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also taken part in preparing a scenario without any agreement.
I am aware of the worrying time this could be for you.
That is why I would like to point out once again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries will be assisted by valuable experiences and expertise in the work of the health case, which will also have a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home too, and we very much want you to stay with us."
Christion Aberthrombosis had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
Annessee State Tigers lineback, Christion Abercrombie, has undergone an emergency surgery following a major head injury to the head of Mike Organ Tennessee, who was killed in the fall of 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Director of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, announced to the journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before mid-term.
“He walked to the coastline and just fell apart,” Reed said.
The coach team and the staff of the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen along the track and then put it on a truck and took it for further investigations.
In Nashville, Tennessee State, one of the competent authorities in Tennessee, told Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercromie is beyond the surgery performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "he does not yet know further details about the type and extent of the injury", while Tennessee State is working on determining exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a one-year holiday student, will spend the first season of his second year in the Tennessee State team to which he has been assigned from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful designs before leaving the field, so the season is already at 18.
Customers from abroad will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the United Kingdom.
According to Toryk's new plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes on properties purchased in the United States and will be able to support the homeless with additional income.
With this step, I will neutralise the successes of Corby's young voters in this step.
The increase in the levy is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the state Treasury, this would amount to USD 120 million per annum, which would be used to support homeless people.
The foreign customers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the United Kingdom and the resulting additional income will be used to support the homeless, preparing to announce theresa May at a press conference today.
The aim of this action is likely to be the balance between the successes achieved by Jeremy Corbyn among the young voters, which has been achieved by the promise of more affordable housing and measures aimed at high incomes.
The increase will concern individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom and the resulting additional income will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional charge added to the current levy, which is to be counted in excess of a higher charge on second-hand dwellings and property purchased for expenditure two years ago, may reach up to three per cent.
The state Treasury will be worth £120 million a year following the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, leading to a significant price increase, which is making the situation of the first apartment buyers more difficult to find.
Many of the rich regions of the country have become "spiritual", especially in the capital, since many are foreign buyers who have spent most of their time outside the country.
The new draft law arrived just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the fees to help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
According to him, the construction companies are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which has become a habit of buying and leaving areas on board. He asked May to cancel quotas for affordable houses and to start something of a "household emergency" in the country.
Corbyn has presented remarkable proposals for the series of housing reforms, including the abolition of rent control and thorough and indemnified emigrations.
In addition, it would provide the Council with more powers and opportunities to build new buildings.
May said: “Tavaly said that I would like to devote my employer to restoring the English dream and that life would be better for each generation.
This will have to address the situation on the real estate market.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live here, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals outside the country, as well as companies of foreign interest, to purchase real estate just as easily as those of the English people who worked hard.
Dreams made from home became impossible for too many people, and the unrequited state of homelessness became too accessible."
Jack Ross: “The greatest desire is for me to be the manager of the Scottish team.”
Jack Ross, Sunderland's manager, says that "the greatest desire" is to be the manager of the Scottish national team once in a while.
A 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take up the challenges of restoring the North-East Club, which is currently in the third position of the first-class league, with only three points left behind from the first position.
He transferred his seat to a stadium named Stadium of Light after successfully returning the St. Mirren team to the first-rate Scottish football championship in the previous season.
"I would have liked to have been a player for my country as well.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the emergency room – he said in Ross's Scottish BBC Sportssound show.
– When I was young, I watched a lot of Scottish team games in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
Now, however, I only get a chance to succeed as a D.A. "
And there's Dick Advisa, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Cano, among the predecessors of Ross's Sunnderland manager.
The former coach of Alta Athlet does not care about the fact that he has to follow in the footsteps of such large names, and has previously refused to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town as well.
“At this point, success is being assessed to see if I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is certainly the place of the first-rate league, he said.
– it will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only consider my activity here to be successful if I manage to get back to the club."
The career of the Ross manager started only three years ago, after for a long time acting as a deputy supervisor for the Dumbarton team, and spent 15 months in the Hearts coach's Guard.
The Aolla helped to stand up after the team dropped back into the third grade and got the title of the champion in the following season with St. Mirren at the end of the fall.
Ross claims that he is much more confident now than ever in his career as a player, whether in Clyde or in Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academy.
‘It was a very decisive moment,’ he recalled the period of time spent as a coach of the Alla.
- Clearly, I thought that management was more of a role for me than a player.
That sounds weird, because I did good, and I had a good life of it, and even I had some really memorable moments.
However, the lives of players are often very hard.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the work, but the management tasks are up to me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the most in my skin all my age."
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel on Sunday, September 30, on Sunday, local time from 12:00 to 3:00 p.m.

In the summer heat wave, traffic in the difficult English pubs has increased significantly, but the supply chains are still under pressure.
On the basis of the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8% in July.
Peter Martin, CGA’s staff member of the business advocating statistics, stated: “As a result of the sunny period and England’s longer than expected world championship, last month’s trend continued in July, when pubs experienced an increase of 2.8% in income, with the fact that a drop in prices was even greater than that observed.
The decrease of 1.8% in the June 1.8% of restaurants has deteriorated further in July.
The pubs and bars that sell mainly alcohol are the best performers, who have produced even greater growth than the loss of the restaurants.
The more food pubs were affected by long-term sunshine, although nearly as dramaticly as the operators of restaurants.
It seems that people prefer drinking to having a good time.
The revenues of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and food revenues by 3%."
Paul Newman, a free time and catering RSM analyst, says: “These results follow the trend to be established since the end of April.
Weather and major Community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the supply chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual drop in revenue of 4.8% could be particularly painful due to the permanent impact of the impact on costs.
It could not have been possible at some point in the long summer of the summer for restaurants operators, and it will only be time to see if the less moderate weather in August will bring relief in this area as well."
The total income growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industrial scale, collects and analyses the performance data of a group of 47 companies with more than 9 billion important turnover.
A child of five has social media accounts that are hidden from his or her parents.
According to one survey, one child (at least 11 years old) has five of the five children with social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 secondary school students, the number of "Insta sub-pages" is increasing.
The news has increased the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of the students replied that they have a "head" account that they can see from their parents.
One child in five (at the age of 11) creates a social media account that is hidden from adults.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta-sub-accounts" referred to on the photo-sharing page is growing rapidly.
The news has given rise to fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students replied that they have an uncomplicated “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.

“I am concerned that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said the leader of the HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eildh Doyle will be the "sound of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Association.
Eildh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the Annual Board meeting.
Doyle's most successful athlete in Scotland, and Chairman of the Council, Ian Beattie, considers that the decision-makers of the sport will be an inestimable contribution to the extensive international experience of his presence in recent years.
“Elidh is a great admirer in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international Athletic Society, and his presence will help the development of Scottish Athletics,” she said.
Doyle said: “I was happy to be the voice of the Athletics, and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sportsmen.”
Two of the four Olympic rifles of American athletes who regularly reported at the BBC were acquired at the transatlantic Olympic Olympics in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres, but a temporary brain circulatory disorder led to a wheelchair.

I couldn't walk.
Doctors told me that in time it would fall apart, whether it would come back at all.
I've been working hard on people, but I've been able to fully recover, I can walk again, and I'm going to agitating practice today.
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
A breast-cow advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides the online community.
There was a lively online debate between a company producing breast-absorbs, which compared the breast-feeding mothers to the brain testes.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first quiet, reliable bra” and the appearance of their product was announced in an ironic advertising of music videos, which showed the freedom the device gives to mothers who have their milk down.
The real mother dances in a cow’s nest full of straw, while in the background you can hear the text of the following lines: “Yes, I understand myself, I don’t have a dick yet” and “if I hadn’t noticed, these are not flat, but my breasts.”
And the novel says, "I'm pumping, pumping, that the baby eats big, pumping, pumping, pumping girls."
The company's publication on the company's website quickly cost you online debates in cross-referencing.
The video has reached 77 000 views, and has received hundreds of comments with a mixed reception. Many people say that the advertisement mocks the dairy industry’s “best.”
"Take unflavoured cows to advertise the product.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life on their way, but their calves are lost within days", recalls one comment.
Elvie bra is discreetly located in a bra ( Elvie/More )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the animal and the calf, too.
But why don't we use them to sell breasts to mothers who can feed their children?"
Someone else added: “Advertising absolutely insensitive.”
Others for the protection of advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “very funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have taken it one way if I'd given it to you again.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a fake commercial, so I'm not even trying to get involved anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny ad to mothers heading their milk at work or in a toilet who feel like a cow.
It does not boast or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that, along the way, they had the discreet breasts in their bra.
The campaign is building on the feeling that women who use breasts sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly located in a bra, so women can move freely, keep their children in hand, or even move out during breast-absorbing.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, says: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be announced in a bold, provocative way.
Pointing to the link between women with the headgear, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges that the use of breast-absorbing breasts poses and to the ambiguity of our breast-absorbing heart rate in relation to this."
Elvie's breast-absorbing didn't come in the news for the first time.
On the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children stepped on the runway in Marta Jakubowski’s clothing while the product was being used.
Multiple-age migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border in secret.
There has been a record of the number of retired migrants in custody, while the number of cross-border movements per month has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that the Trump Administration's follow-up rhetoric and previous measures have made it more difficult for them to find more host homes for them.
In particular, the recipients themselves are illegal immigrants, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be undermined if they applied for the admission of children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that the parents who came into contact with them and adults living with them should give fingerprints, and these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Bemigration and Customs Office) in front of the Congress last week, admitted that dozens of people have been arrested who have applied for the reception of minors who have not been escorted.
The Office later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had a criminal record.
“Employees and 80% of those living with them in a household are illegally present in the country and a significant proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals," Albence stated.
New rules have been introduced to speed up proceedings in respect of children, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of their arrest in place of 60 days, instead of social workers.
Many people report through a videoconferencing call in court instead of having a personal presence to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers have reported that the longer they take into custody, the more nervous and depressed their children will be, and the more violent outbursts or attempts to escape have been made.
According to lawyers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to its tornados, where it is more difficult to filter psychological care patients due to the number of children.
They have added that if they do not provide enough time for children to prepare or leave their friends before they are transferred to such an establishment, it would make them even more trauma.
Syria immediately called for the American, French and Turkish “invading forces” to leave the country.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem, presiding in front of the UN General Assembly, has asked Syrian refugees to return to their country of origin, despite a civil war that has continued for the third year.
Moulalem, also Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign troops have entered the Syrian territory illegally, referring to the fight against terrorism, and "so will they be treated."
He told the General Assembly that he would have to “responsibly and unconditionally withdraw,” he said.
Moulem claimed that "the war on terror will soon end" in Syria, where over 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He stated that Damascus will "sacrifice his holy battle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria" from terrorist groups and "the illegal external presence."
The United States of America has 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them as volunteers and advisors to the Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting against the Bassar El-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the war - affected country.
Concerning refugees, Moulem claimed that they were in a proper situation for their return and that only "one Western country" would promote "irraditional fears", deterring refugees from returning.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return,” he said.
– Politicians have made a policy of a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned against providing reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and his opposition on the conclusion of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the agreement between Russia and Turkey, which establishes a conflict zone around Idlib, the last great uprising of the rebels, can contribute to further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish negotiations prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a major attack on the three-millimeter provinces.
Moulem also stressed that the agreement set out “light deadlines” and indicated its hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including an-Nustra Front, linked to Al-Kaida, which would be “most likely to be removed”.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of representatives of the Government and the opposition will soon be able to be convened, with the task of preparing the post-war constitution and preparing the elections.
Moulem, subject to the conditions of participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, for example, is considered to be only "the review of some of the articles of the Constitution" and should warn all external actors against taking any action in the process.
This is why they will be re-elected Trumpot.
Following this logic, Trumpo will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless it is true that many liberal seers have their hopes and will not end the presidency of a process of taking responsibility or a scandal before the end of its term of office.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.”
For the time being, the viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, the CNN's main programme ratings have increased by nearly doubled, 1,05 million since 2014, while the MSNBC has nearly tripled its view by 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2,4 million viewers in the main programme period over 1,7 million years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC is the most recent event with its 3.5 million audience, achieved on the evenings of the days leading to the most significant news.

Unlike the television series, the stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to Roe vs Wade-precedents, whether or not immigrant families can reunite and the stability of the world economy.
It can only be a very narrow layer so that you do not care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we've been watching a debate show about the authenticity of the anonymous conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Father", or about Paul Manafort's 15 thousand-dollar strucible leather jacket ("the trail of the body" according to the wording of The Washington Post), or about the consequences of Stormy Daniels Trump, uh, anatomy's description of Stormy Daniels Trump, e.g., anatomy.
What happened to me, from now on, is always going to come to me about the Super Mario.
“It’s a little bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, Creator of the "sign stars". In Trump’s show, the actors are changing and new turns are coming every day (such as N.F.L., starting to praise Kim Jungun).
If you miss one part of this, you'll be missed immediately.
This week, when I reached Fleiss, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time for Kaaai, he was still in there looking at the MSNBC in his house while recording CNN's show.
He could not deviate from the way Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began at the Senate Committee on Justice, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was a bet.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
- I thought they were kidding, but it seems they were right."

Both sides pour the money into the highest competitions of the mid-term congress election.
No one was surprised that in the 17th Chamber of Pennsylvania, both parties spend their money in a nude way, after two active representatives have been appointed for the same title after redesigning the districts of Congress.
The recently redesigned part of the suburban district of Pittsburgh is one of the democratic Conor Lambs, who received a mandate last spring at an interim election.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of the previous 12th Party of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17th District.
The map had to be redesigned after the High Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the ex-ante limits had been manipulated for the benefit of the Republics.
In the fight for justice, the financing body of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (CCCC) and the National Republicaign Committee (NRCC) have been bidding each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name has become known in Pennsylvania since he won the March mid-term election in close competition in the 18th Congress Party in Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, the seat was owned by Republicans, and Donald Trump won a 20-point advance in the district.
According to the political expert, Democrats have a much better chance of winning.
The United States of America has considered sanctions against El predicament due to China's support and then stopped planning to take action against the United States El predicament.
According to diplomas, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already stood on the side of Beijing, which Washington did not respond to.
Donald Trump negotiated well with Juan Manuel Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced the management team of the Trump Organization out of there.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, U.S. Secretary-General of the United States of America because of their "recent decision not to support Taiwan", previously announced Heather Nauer, the spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received around USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a painful impact on the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also very high.
As closed meetings continued, North and Central America's responsibilities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a follow-up to a similar meeting last year and its primary objective was to reduce migration to the United States.
In the middle of September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not wish to punish El Salvador.
They announced that at the conference scheduled for mid-October, President Mike Pence was also speaking, which, according to diplomats, clearly indicates how important this event is to the administration.
The three American delegates returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue referee statements and did not impose sanctions.
Mr Bolton's White House speaker did not wish to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by the three American officials, including two diplomats.
The reports were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also in an anonymous position to speak.

The next attempt could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who will examine whether Trump has in any way prevented the judiciary.... That is to say, a number of public figures suggest that this is what Trump is doing.
Mueller's investigation also claims to include whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are put into a majority in the Union, they will certainly try to take responsibility for Mr Trumpot, who may have to face the judgment of his politicians after the voters.
You can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as is the case with European policy lovers.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will take.
In 1938, several German officers were willing to kick Hitler, waiting for the West to join the Czechs in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
At historical events such as this, it is settled that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify several of these loop points.
What will Trump do if he replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Inspector of the Mueller's investigation?
Mr. Rosenstein's chair has been sneezing since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he proposed to record talks with the President and suggested that Trump's office be terminated.
According to Rosen, The Times reported the events correctly.
"How will we react if the F.B.I. study against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or incomplete and is appointed to the Supreme Court for a credible sexual assault charge?
And the most important question is that in the interim elections, we are voting for a committee that is willing to take responsibility for Trumpo?
If we fail in these tenets, democracy will look ahead to a long winter.
I trust you will not, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Jew in Czechoslovakia, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once existed in the building of my ambassador's home.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she asked me to light candles on a table with the sign of the blonde at Sabbath.
How can cultural heritage be a pussimistic about our future?"

The Rangers player Graham Dorans is a trustee at the Rangers before the war against the Rapid Wien.
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. The Austrians will be able to participate in the European League G group after the unforeseeable tie against the Spanish Härreal.
Due to the knee injury of the middle-way Graham Dorrans, he was unable to move forward in the season until 2nd round against the Villareal, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can also set more bold goals for themselves.
“It was a very important point for a great team to fight against the Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
- We believed that we could get a point, and we brought a point.
Maybe the last time we could've pulled in another goal, but we can't complain to the tie.
In the first half, they were better, and we connected in the second half.
There will be another important European match on Thursday.
I hope we can get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their previous destination, but behind our backs, our fans will certainly have the strength to win.
Last year was hard, I got hurt, there was a lot of changes around the club, but now it's a very optimistic mood.
We have a good team, the guys enjoy the game, the workouts are good.
I hope that if we give it all in, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
Many women are concerned about not saving enough age.
The participants in the survey had an accurate understanding of what age care they wanted, but only a small proportion of them talked to their family members about this.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouses.
Only 10% of them replied to the fact that she was talking to her child about this.
“Everybody wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t tend to raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance business.
The following should be done.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and your child: You cannot expect them to take care of you properly if you do not tell me in time what your needs are.
They shall, together with their counsel and family, select where and what kind of care they seek; these decisions shall have a significant impact on the subsequent costs.
Take in a financial adviser: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned supply.
Funding is a traditional old-age insurance policy or a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings, which can cover expenses or use its own assets as collateral... if it has sufficient resources.
Prepare the legal documentation: In this way, they will pre-empt the possibility of subsequent appeals.
Trust a representative, a reliable person who will act on your behalf on health matters, will supervise your medical care and ensure that everything happens as required even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone's financial management.
This reliable person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure that the accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: suppose your elderly parent has been in medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
This data should be recorded in writing in order to be available at any time.
“It’s not just financial matters that need to be clarified, and it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
What medicines are being taken “What are you taking? ”
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It must be planned in advance."

The federal prosecutors have applied for a death sentence for the New York terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutors of New York are asking for a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the victim of the two life-requisites in New York City, who have not been executed in the state since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saopov was accused of driving a truck hired from Home Depot on a road on the west Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in the streets of West Side Highway, with many pedestrians and cyclists swept up.
In order to prove the lawfulness of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims deliberately and that he was ‘intended to cause’ damage, stands in the submission of a statement to the D.A.'s office in the South of New York.
According to the file submitted, evidence of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eightfold blackmail killings, which were likely to be used exclusively for the purpose of combating organised crime and the destruction and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack “requisited substantial planning and premeditated intent”, claims the prosecutors, and Saipov, as they put it, carried out in a “serious, unfair, inhumane way” manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov’s pain and loss were caused by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family”, says the petition.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
South New York District has been asking for a death sentence for a defendant for the last decade.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to two drug dealers for murder, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In the last case of the New York federal case, a death sentence was carried out in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the spouse was convicted two years before that of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both novelties were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown no objection in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he claimed that he was happy to do so.
Saipov said that ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, standing in the case of an indictment.
According to the police, he asked to take out an ISIS swimsuit in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, he considered himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipovot, said that they were "clearly disappointed" at the decision of the prosecutors.
“We believe that the actual life sentence for the confession would have been more favourable, and that the death penalty would only delay the suffering of all the parties involved in the case,” says Patton.
Saipov's defense formerly asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty for their defence.
A member of Tory said that Nigel FARAGE should lead the Brexit concessions.
Nigel Farage stated in a statement held at the Tory Conference that he “invited the people’s army to fight. ”
According to Ukip's former leader, politicians need to feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics after one of the partners of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with the negotiations with the EU.
Non-Opportunity Conservative Peter Bone told the Birmingham Assembly that the United Kingdom would have ‘became out long ago’ if Farage were the Brexit Minister of State.
He is well aware of the pressure within the Mayre party that the Toryk Residual party spoke at another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires permanent reporting between Brexit and the remaining partners and the EU.
According to his allies, he is trying to reach agreement with Brussels on the issue of negative reactions, so that the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party can choose only from their package or from "full chaos".
Bone on Leave Means Leave in Solihuhull (Exit means exiting) said that the ‘Chequers Initiative’ should be counted.
He suggested that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have quit,” he said.
The representative of Wellingborough added: “I will continue with Brexit, but the Chequers deal must be settled.”
Criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world war to be other servants of the world.
We allow the law of our own country to be brought into our own country."
Bone rejected the argument that the opinion changed since the 2016 vote: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and want to remain."
Andrea Jenkyns, representative of the Brexit-Party Tory, also attended the meeting and told the journalists: “All I ask is this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people’s voice.
The Querrs agreement rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unbelieving, and especially the activists who work in the field and help us get to the government.
Forget the Querrs deal and listen to us."
Ay was sent by a close-up message to Ay and said: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his seat, who keeps his word.”
Farage said in the assembly that politicians "must feel pressure" so as not to betray the result of the 2016 referendum.
“We, that is, trust between the people and our politicians, are now at stake, ” he stated.
- He's trying to betray the Brixite, and today we're gathered to ensure that we won't let him do it."
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like if our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, felt pressure.
We call on the people's army to win the battle with Brexit, and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is once again an independent, independent, proud country."
The remaining partners then came to Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Some of the assets formed this weekend were flying the flag of the movement "Trek against Brexit".
Mr. Adonis from the Labour Party was on the Conservatives because of the security errors that occurred at the opening of the conference, for the purposes of the party's application.
He added: “These people said that they had an IT background to a Canadian-additional-plus agreement, a border crossing without a charge and a free trade agreement with Ireland without frontiers,” he added.
- They'll talk to you in private.
There is no good Brexit" – he stressed.
He is ready to go for the presidency "if you think it's a good idea".
Senator Warren said that after the election in November, he would carefully see to it that he was running for the presidency.

This afternoon’s event was held in Holyoke in the 36th Civil Forum meeting with the citizens since the entry into office of Trump.
A participant asked if he was planning to start the presidential election.
In response to Mr President, it is time for "women to also take part in the settlement of the misguided government in Washington, including the taking of the highest position".

Russian Grand Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton has come closer to the World Championship title after he has won the victory before the É Vettel thanks to the team briefings.
After Vatteri Bottas qualified himself in a better place than Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the instructions from the Mercedes team will play a major role in my race.
Bottas, who started out of position, started off well, and almost put Hamilton in trouble because he protected his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, he stood up for the boxer and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the center, which should have proved decisive.
Mercedes stood up a circle later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton stood up for a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot was reluctant to abandon the internal arc after moving twice to defend himself in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the slot points, and by the end of the first round it was the seventh.
After that, it led to a large part of the race because it did not change tyres to quickly target and beat Kimi Räikkön in the hope of the second place.
Finally, he stood on the 44th round in the boxing bay, but in the last eight rounds he couldn't increase his hip, so Räikköne became the second place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let go of me.
The team made an exceptional effort to get the first two seats", said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that he not leaked a letter from Mrs. Blasy Ford accusing of sexual assaulting Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, but he only noted that things in the Senate prove that people are “infidels, insolents and liars. ”
“What happens, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate the last few days, when you see anger when you see people being hateful, cruel, wonderful, and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
What do you mean?
Danne Feinstein, are you leaked?
Can you give me a reply... you leaked the document? – oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, hold on a second.
We leaked?... No, we didn't leak", he added, copying the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July and leaked early September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak would be his office.
“I did not threaten Dr. Ford’s claims, nor leaked his story,” Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill’s report.
"He asked me to keep him confidential and to keep him confidential according to his request."
However, it seems that his refusal was not accepted by the president, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what the situation is: his speech was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst word I've ever seen."
The President continued to claim that the members of the Supreme Court of the three women accused of sexual harassment should be accused of the use of alleged charges by the Democrats for their own purposes.
“ They are determined to recover power by any means, but also by any means necessary, ” he says.
They can see vanity, amazeness, they don't care who they're hurting, who they have to cross to get power and control", quoted the President's words to Mediate.

According to the New York Post, after waking up for the shooting of himself, Plasco-Flaxman had released Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a bad job, and rather was counting on a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day's work and sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for the dismissal and seeking compensation of 350 dollars a day for the six-month period of notice for which he was originally hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop, what can not be done,” said the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple reacted to their claims of racism that it was reasonable to abolish Maurice's use because they were afraid that he could not be trusted after being offended.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to do.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
“But would you trust your father with someone who, even if by chance, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!
According to Plasco, his wife gave birth only two months ago, and “she was in a very difficult situation”.
“ Would anyone attack that person?
It's not really good to do something," said the investment banker.
As the legal procedure is in place, the public opinion court has quickly condemned the party in the social media, harming their behaviour and logic.
According to a recent letter, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter: “It is difficult to imagine yourself as someone who first reads before his publication.
This information is fun enough now that we know how great a success Paddington is."
According to him, his father, who worked as the operator of the BBC before he had inspired the writing of a pet book about a small toy bear, would not have bothered if he had been rejected, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bitter success following his father's death last year.
Paddont called him “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not at all engrossed,” he said.
“But since Paddington was real to him, he was like a child carrying something: we are proud of him even if it is not really our own.
I think you could see Paddington's success somehow.
Although he created it and came out of his imagination, he always considered it to be the merit of Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to tell her through the phone.
At the time of the landing, her daughter and I were sent to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, in which doctors fought in vain for their lives.
“They asked me to tell you that he was in very bad condition and that he was not expected to survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“After receiving a call from them, telling me that my daughter will die the next two minutes and I have to thank her.
I'm good to go.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be right back.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart moving, they ran out slowly and then they left her body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait until I know it's all over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that point in time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with others who did not care about the torture she went through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I threw my head off and my eyes were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there, on the plane, I felt all this overpriced sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know he loved my daughter very much."
A card of mourning women to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of a suicide are working to prevent others from throwing away their lives.
She put out card cards and letters of inspiration and emergency numbers on a Wi-Wales Bridge with Sharon and Humphreys inspired messages and emergency numbers.
Ms. Davis' son, he was 13 years old when he became depressed and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydia, told me that her son was a promising cook, and she smiled at everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
"They always said that his smile would put up any place."
However, before he died, he gave up his job because he “was in a very bad state.”
She was found by her former 11-year-old brother, who ended her life on her own.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would result in some domino effect.”
Ms. David made the cards for that purpose, “because people know that there are people who can be contacted and spoken to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit quietly – you need to talk!"
Ms. Humphrey, who, for years, lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend, Mark, who was a partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say that he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“Somedays before winter, we noticed a change in your attitude.
She was all under the sun on Christmas Day: when the children opened their presents, she didn't look in their eyes or anything like that."
He said that his death had been a major trauma for them, but it has to be processed: “He left a huge gap in the family.
A little bit has broken their hearts for a while.
But we must continue to fight."

Question Brett Kavanaugh's future, as was the case with the Firm's initial investigation.
“I thought that if he achieved what he requested — a limited-term investigation of limited size — perhaps we could reach an agreement — he said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee had held a "departure" on account of the party’s inability to decide.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and Republican supporters object to the investigation into the FBI?
Their resistance is limited to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if Republicans are expected to fail, it will be much harder for them to get their people to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and at their house for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and he also saw his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary through him.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow the Vice-President, Mike Pence, to take the decision to bring Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's dissidents has been reduced under Kim's control.
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jongun took power seven years ago, and a South Korean legislator has declared a South Korean legislation.
Park Bjangsok quoted data from the Ministry of Southern Unity and said that 1127 dissidents in the past year were 1127 compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
He said that the higher penalties for the closer border between North Korea and China and for smugglers were the main reasons.
Phen will not comment on this information publicly.
In the end, most of the Northern Dissidents will be granted citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in Saint Petersburg.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitary Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are received by China as illegal immigrants and not as refugees and often sent back by violence.
The practical North-South relationship that is still at war has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, and their discussion focused on the stuck nuclear decommissioning negotiations.
This historic meeting took place in June between the President of the United States of America of Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, where large lines agreed on further cooperation with Korea, a nuclear-free party.
However, on Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jongho accused the US of sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, trust in our national security is not at hand, and under such circumstances it is incredible that we unilaterally reduce our weapons,” Ri said in his speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
He called Brett Kavanaugh "histastic", according to him, unfit for the Supreme Court.
The President of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court "historical" and claimed that his conduct did not correspond to his work at the Supreme Court.
In an interview, Pelosi presented himself at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I would have thought that if a woman were to do so at any time, I would call her "histastic" – she explained her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh, which she did before the Justice Committee of the Senate of April.
He protested against rumors that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Blasy Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kénaugh was very emotional, sometimes shouted and his voice turned out when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also extraordinarily condemned the Committee's Democrats, the charges brought against him, calling it "the grotesque and coordinated murder," were organised by liberals who were concerned about the defeat of the Presidential election in Hillary Clinton in 2016.
He was afraid that he felt that Kavanaugh's behaviour proved that he was not fit to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I believe that he excluded himself with his statements and the behaviour he has shown against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
He was afraid when he was asked if he would try to take responsibility for Kavanaugh, in case he reached the post, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House.
“I’m saying that if you don’t tell the truth to the U.S. or the FBI, you’re not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where you are now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the capital appeal court.
He added that he was concerned as a Democrat about possible decisions by Kavanaugh on the subject of the Available Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, as Kavanaugh is a Conservative Judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether or not to copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court and expect us to tear from joy,” said Pelosi.
And the woman has to keep her under control.
This is a legitimate outburst, months and years of intense rage, and it can't give out without crying.
“We cry when we are gay,” she told me Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so rare, do I?”
“There was a woman who worked for me somewhere in the leading position,” she continued. “ She told me that she was crying in her rage, but she developed a technique that said, when she started crying in her anger, she told her conversation partner: ‘ She might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I will be angry. ”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, they look at the tears as a sign of the storm because they were basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early work, a man's office, where I once began to cry in my fierce insolence that a woman older than my neck – a cool manager I was always afraid of – grabbed me and took me to the stairwell.
“So let them cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've managed to upset you."
Patricia Schiroeder, then Democrat Congressman from Colorado, Gary Harttal, moved to the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-married ex-wife on the condition that he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he thought there was no reason why he couldn't start his own presidency himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought-out decision,” he said to me, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and another candidate was wanted in the middle of their backs.
Someone named it “The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. ”
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money, so she pledged she wouldn't compete unless she took up the $2 million.
His battle was a lifelong battle.
He realized that some of his supporters gave men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“Did you think that I would receive a discount? ” he was thinking.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so overwhelmed by gratitude for the people who supported him, and by the frustration against the system of money and directly making it difficult to reach voters and the hatred of sexuality, that the throat was blocked.
"They believed that I had nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, how the press reacted to it.
“They believed that Kleenex was my regular sponsor.
I was wondering what they were going to write on my headstone.
“He cried.”
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening line of the US-China trade war was almost cumbersome, and the battle was not yet over, and the break-in between countries is thought to be a long-term deal for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, issued the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing taxes on the major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant ecalation took place this week, since the new duties already concern 200 billion dollars of goods, practically taxing half the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, he has retreaded the last duty of between five and ten percent for a USD 60 billion product in the USA.
China has pledged to retaliate every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not be able to back down in the near future.
If you want to get him to back up, that would mean he has to give up his leg before claims, but public acceptance to the US would be too embarrassing for Hsi Chin-ping, President of China.
However, according to the expert, if Beijing is doing well, the US trade war pressure will be good for China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision, whether in Washington or in Beijing, could create conditions that could bring any of the economies of both countries into economic order is much more serious than that of observers previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant for Asia research at New American Security brain disease.
Syria "ready" to return to the refugees, claims the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Syria claims that it is ready for voluntary refugee returns and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country destroyed during the war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Vald Moallam, Minister for Foreign Affairs, claimed that the country's conditions are improving.
“The current situation is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now all conditions exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to flee between terrorism and self-authorised economic measures, which affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the UN, over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Moallem told me that the Syrian state is willing to accept all assistance for the reconstruction of the country.
But he stressed that no mandatory assistance or assistance from countries that supported the resurrection would be accepted.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup of 2018, defeating the U.S. team 16,5:1 May in proportion to the Les Gold Road outside of the country.
The United States has now fallen for the sixth time on the European scene after the second time, and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has protected its title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14.5 points needed to overcome the United States of America.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who fought the entire tournament, was hit in the water by handing over to Francesco Molinari on the par-3, 4th of April, giving him victory.
The original player Molinari was glowing everywhere, so he became one of the 4 players who ever achieved the 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in 1979 in its current form.
The United States of America has received 5-8-4 from the lowest player in the European team, Thorbjärrn Olesen, Denmark.
Among the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, lost $2 to Ian Poulter, who may have been involved in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder-dove veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of the tournament at 25,5 years of age.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy to be able to help you," he said after the European victory against emotions in Garcia.
Give the stafetabot to Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. college, Tiger Woods, on an average of 2-3 to one-ones.
“I have incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, growing up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
These have lost all four of them in France, and now they have a 13-to- 21 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a remarkable statistics from one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 titles and only Jack Nicklaus before him.
The U.S. team has been fighting all weekend except for Matt Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who were great golfers throughout the tournament.
Following the disappointing outcome of the U.S. Team Captain Jim Furyk's team, he said: “He is proud of these guys who have fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We've been through this.
Let go of the hat before Thomas.
Captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to redeploy our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love this 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must raise your hats too.
The opponent was better with us."
Springland News: I'm dropping my concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee shows a general reduction in red blood concentration in certain areas of the Bay of Tampa.
According to the FWC, the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County has been reported to be the largest flowering in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a decrease in concentration.
The extent of red tide is approximately 130 miles from the coast, from the northern Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Some 10 miles from the outskirts of Hillsborough County, there are sites, but last week are relatively smaller areas than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco county.
A mid-term concentration was reported last week in Pinellas county and along shores, low-to-high-value concentrations along the coasts of Hillsborough county, from background to high-value concentrations in Manatee county, from background to high-value concentrations in Sarasota county and along shores, from background to average concentrations in London county, from background to high-value concentrations in Lene county and along shores and low concentrations in Collier county.
There have been further reports of respiratory irritation in Piellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier county.
Last week there was no respiratory irritation from North Florida.
