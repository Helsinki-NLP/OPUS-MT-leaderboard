The 28-year-old kitchen champion was found dead at the shopping center in San Francisco
The 28-year-old kitchen champion who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping center's stairway this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says: “His affairs finally went well.
The body found at Westfield Mall at Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, San Francisco's death investigator's agency.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a crime and that the investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel KGO in San Francisco, that Frank, who had previously served as a coach in Boston, had received his dream job as the Sanfrancisco Sons & Daughters restaurant director six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said they were “sacrified and shocked,” because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a dense family, and he will be very much missed,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostel, but that recently, his thing was going well.
“He found the apartment and met a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said she doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her younger brother.
He was a benevolent, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to make food for us, to do dinner, Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who drove along with the river.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an unspoken diamond who shined brighter every day,” he said.
All who have information about this will be invited to call San Francisco Police Department's hint line number 415-555-4444.
Doctors to strike: Requirements for new work combat measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to adopt new labour-related measures in their dispute on the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the entire Council to support the new working struggle measures since the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
Doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
In a letter published through Twitter on Thursday evening, President Ellen McCourt of the JDC said that the government had remained silent on the one side of the treaty, which led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council, in order to obtain authorisation for a progressive and expanding work struggle programme starting early in September.
The dispute has been followed by the fact that medical practitioners have participated in the six strikes this year, including the first complete employment stop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The President of the BMA medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected by the agreement, the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before 54,000 medical practitioners and students voted that the agreement was good and that it should be approved.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, which ended up in the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to hand each other and to declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in St. Petersburg's palace in the golden hall, I got a clear impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
Yes, the event was hidden.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he hardly threatened the heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke constantly of his “hard friend,” Putin, five times according to a report.
I'm confused with the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his passion described the opposite.
But Putin’s burning delay showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
At the time, Moscow’s reaction was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara because it stabbed Moscow on his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a certain friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state led to an amazing, thorough attack against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade from the Syrian territories ruled by Isis.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of anarcha's agreement are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failed coup last month.
Continuous terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly plagued him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on order flights, which typically carry millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and order airlines will certainly be relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They are hoping for a late season to run into the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
“You came back here, tomatoes back here, as described in the report of the Vedemosti-sanoma magazine.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
When it is added to the long-lasting prosperity from the advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin will emerge, which is eager to use the coolness and to disrupt Turkey's ties to the Western countries.
The Russian leader certainly received exit points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary company to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is an explanation for Moscow, who has its own deep rooted fear of the change of power.
So this meeting in the Prama Sea Fair allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce the \"outside alliance\", as one analyst described to me: two countries that experience them being abandoned by the West and treated them incorrectly, combining their strength.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After six months of open hate, and given the possibility of a full disaster, a member of NATO when Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be cut to back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand had joined the bank’s international goals.
After the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and it had to save, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have now used the “RBS” brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of international sports sponsorships, six Nations-rugby Wimbledon Master Andy Murrayy.
But now it is right to let the national brands come to the front.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be re-started again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references are converted to NatWest, except for the main office and stock exchange lists.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed in a round of customers and staff at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand becomes our investor brand and our employees’ employer, because we now become a lot more brand bank.
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move in the direction of the brands’ bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work that we have done as focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettori showers champagne after double gain has a total of 3,000 wins
The racer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory on Newmarket Friday.
He arrived at his second victory on his home trail in the evening, when he competed with John Gosden by coaching the Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time masterjockey Dettori, who won earlier at Ghayyar, said: \"This is special...
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, but a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks on his own when he pulls the Predilection out after the victory.
Two racers have achieved this milestone in the obstacle contests – masterjockey Richard Johnson and a 20-fold master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had records of his infringing career over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best athletes in the current era, and it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, which only few have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical idiot separates him from the other weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his passion and charisma have drawn fans to the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have been riding with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
With serious talk, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is a good thing for British competition, but he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a plane landing from a fairy.
From flying to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain trail.
In 1996, he also survived an aircraft accident and suffered a non-competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, she was difficult to get back to her six months after the ban on competition, but she showed a significant nature when interviewing suspects and returning to her best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, and Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin separates the Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
63-year-old is now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the President of Russia, but there was no reason to do so.
Ivanov's assistant director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later led the President’s protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the Head of State, as a result of the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that Vaino be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, was a Soviet security service in KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the head of government withdrew from their own request.
But despite the smile of the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official statement that a man once promoted as a potential presidential candidate wants to suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy has been accepted in a very suspicious way.
In his comments to Putin on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: “It is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex task, even if I could say the job, the task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months...
Ivanov adopted the task in December 2011.
He used to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed Vice President.
When Putin rose to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Put after the second season, because Putin’s third season would have been against the Constitution.
However, this task went to another ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to president only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star, Thomas Gibson, got a shoe after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in the physical dispute last month at the show's scene in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchneri presented an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened, he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from the FBI team's series are expected later.
The 54-year-old Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be with you until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans on the series.
The twelfth of the series is planned on 28 September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden of Banff
The man in Banffi has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windmills left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published a film in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fifeen
1.35 md. frame project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the northern deck of Queensferry’s crossing site, as well as the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifeen.
It is the first of the four closures between the cans, which are now preparing for each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 brush ropes.
The 1.35 mrd project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the working country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry’s crossing place.
We prove all really impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge capacity.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where the extreme precise dimensions must be agreed.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the last part of the deck is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the whole cover is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Consultors project, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
When the last road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road map, we had to then close the remaining part on the north side, i.e. inland.
This was done by pulling 700 mm south of the northern route.
This was a huge and very demanding measure at the same time.
Huge, because the ground is 222 meters long, weigh about 6000 tonnes and it was supposed to be pulled at about 3% angle.
It is necessary because the allowed deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are very happy when they are alive.
Three men are very happy when they were alive, after they fell off their fishing boats in front of England.
The Moelfre RNLI emergency station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 (BST) after the crew saw the event developing with the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in safety while their boats were moving on to themselves.
“We saw the boat orbiting closer men, and we imagined the worst,” said Moelfre’s rescue-water Swedishman Vince Jones.
“Today, a strong wind blew it away by the time we started,” he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found hanging out of the boat without a lifeboat.
The men were taken into the coastboat and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said: “These three men who were in the water are happy when they were alive and completely unharmed.
The boat engine had a cappocket rope, but it had somehow disconnected the boat from the time-time person when the boat crashed.
Someone's taking care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting of health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The viewing time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now in recent times to smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and external air activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, reference is made to the pokémon Go. Application, which was based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they were born in the cartoon series, game cards and other follow-up products).
As many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as a huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in the days of Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are traced using GPS, and which can be “photocopyed” after finding.
The generation that played the game younger has joined the wild and jumped up with the couch.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the “center person”.
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days the number of people moving within 30 minutes of the game jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn’t know who to play Pokemon Gota, it only sees training level data.
The demands of many public health campaigns, including 30-,-a rise in the sofa and-to-be active every day, have not yielded any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and they are transmitted by people who seem to be unhapped.
However, the importance of sports cannot be reduced.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse here.
Pokémon Gon’s fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how three pillars of health are covered: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they hunt.
As usual, the pulverizers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
And then what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were earlier applications like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The news loss disappears and the use of the news is overthrown in time.
However, because of Pokemon’s success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the public hearing.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
An energetic hypnotic.
It's a diving boom.
It's incredible with the permanco.
That's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between itself and the rest of the world to appear in the light of the Olympics.
His overall point, 6.2.198, was clearly better than Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aly Raisman.
Simone Biles in the United States Balance Party at the Women's Telecommunications Championship in the final of individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil at Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has won the championship in a row, and, overall, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He broke up with tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement will bring him to the same category with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have brought their species to a new level:
Biles has ruled his species for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, programs whose ambition and accuracy mix has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him \"to be the best to see as a gymnast.\"
The last attempt was in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning to the family home in Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, on the left of the United States, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and shopping pool (in this order) in the final of the Women's Teen Gym game in the 2016 Summer Olympics in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, the film.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as a peak at the National Team Coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future when going to the top of my knowledge, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, which includes the extremism of his trademark, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympics.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taaperone, was found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the hall where Boorman coached her, has become a forcemaker.
He has not lost a multiplayer game since the summer of 2013, and this winning tube will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a misconception.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is a dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top of the boom points at 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 permanno.
Raisman had a good taste when they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose to the eyes of the Biles glitter-red, white and blue-limited, when the dream of which he once wrote his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of revant from four years ago, when he was in a divided third place, but lost his bronze to Mustaf.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, called \"father\", was clearly in charge.
He sent planes to the public after his permanence, in the atmosphere of return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles comes, this widespread twitting of 19 years old from this week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot when they heard music in the car.
In the most deadly attack in Phoenix's last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car to talk and listen to music when they were shot.
The authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on June 12.
The report states that the shooter on the passenger side of the car fired his hand up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or another adult victim $2900.
The Phoenix police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting was made by researchers to see if it was connected to the four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks in four months, mainly in the Latin American region.
“These things happen in front of the home,” Howard said earlier this month to CBS’s subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillacia or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and that they were made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was injured in a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release that took place only half an hour before the death of the triangular and aimed at an empty open van, which is believed to have been a serial killer's job.
The researchers found the seals of the bullets, the bullet seat, and the bullet's cracks in the engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: \"Your account will be made easier.
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a minor. This is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I could not do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do that.
Which is not true, of course, I promised, he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that “I didn’t know people were still doing it,” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walks.
Edmund didn't sit or steal like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and riding on a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how, with Edmund's notes, you'd sing to me.
“We’re teaching him a sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language, he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own fives.
Microcephalitis may be due to a number of different causes: genetics, such as Edmund, or pregnancy-related viral infections, such as ash cells or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in time, because I don’t expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect from Zika.
It's gonna be easier.
You can believe that this is going to make it easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The lakes and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
The harsh rain and widespread floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in the South of Louisiana and the Southern Mississippi flooded over their storms and caused a large flooding due to the extremely harsh rains.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that aid is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Bureau, said that they would receive requests for rising water transportation, boats and sand jackets.
Steele said that the Tangipahoan County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flooding is valid until Saturday, in most of the southern Louisianas.
The weather service said in the statement that three more cents of rain are expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, flooding was in force on Friday, when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood ticket record during the weekend.
The regulator, Alek Krautmann, said that both rivers could flood several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension County along the river, when flooding rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas Lake.
On the south side of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River in Lousiana Liverpool was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning from 9 a.m.
The rescuers are still picking people from flood water in Amiten and Wilkinson districts in the south-west Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son were close to the Glosterers on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that, normally, over 400 feet away from his house, Beaver Creek’s water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other boy who lived near him warned him.
“We walked, and the water only continued to rise,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she hasn’t seen the water in so high over the 48 years she lived in.
Hansford said that both his family and his family have injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said the rescue workers saved the three of them in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the nested nights were on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spread, as the heavy rain continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely bored of the heavy rain until the middle of the week.
The flooding of the lakes and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of the Tangipaho County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipapaho, a member of the City Council said 200 homes were under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under the flood.
President of the District, Robby Miller, said the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets remaining in the waters of the rising water.
The cities of Amni and Hammond have opened up shelters for those who have evacuated.
“They get back to their homes when the water starts to fall,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in the Tangipaho district, twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
“The last great flood was here in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administration.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississip, Harrison County Emergency Officer Rupert Lacy said the flat rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were told to be flooded, but no flooding incident has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amita, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and rain still continues.
“Today’s bullets – been six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive the Philadelphia shooting
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The parents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown had several shooting wounds, including the nipples, foot, hand and stomach, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets,” says Delores Melendez, the boy’s grandmother.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition is considered critical, and several cuts have been made to him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local school.
Brown was one of four shootings on the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One 29-year-old man was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in front of the car together with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the status reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
The attacks on the attack, which are from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant struggle.
On the street, there were seals on both sides of the road.
“It seems, therefore, that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were active in the battle,” says Anthony Ginaldi, the Philadelphia police officer.
Many houses and transportations in the area were also hit.
The arrests have not been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating the recordings of the surveillance camera.
The other six-year-old girl, she got a mistake on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabbya and Laurie?
That is why I call this year's women's Olympics gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie- Hernandez, who have inspired many girls.
The composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everyone proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
Over the past four years, the most successful female educator has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised by the Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances of three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterly gymnastic programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has won an individual gold in women's multiplayer match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation in this gym doesn’t look different to the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are “Final Five” (the last five), because there will be only four gymnastics in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year of Marta Karly.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics are a precious species, and gymnastics tend to practice mainly in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay coaching, facilities, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
A large proportion of these gyms are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
These clubs get all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to gymnastic families.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring a more affordable and available gymnastic training to communities where many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lauri live.
I founded my gym 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide a high-level gymnastical life for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic species.
Forcers develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental greed, rigour and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work leaving.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing you seriously the \"girl power\" by winning the Olympic team ball, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Doctors organise new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 medical practitioners who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was on an unknown soil, and that small delays would harm the staff and the patients.
The first physicians will be transferred to a new agreement, which will include changes to night and weekend work practices to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Medical Committee, said last night in a statement: “The medical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially in order to accelerate the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all physicians in a balanced manner.
When the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement for eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve disputes through negotiations have faced the government’s undesirableness to participate and sometimes deep silence.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the obligation and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners are ready to continue their work struggle.
At the end of April, the last strike meant a delay in nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100 000 reception periods, when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as a substitute for doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute by agreeing to an enhanced agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend wage with 54,000 doctors under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners so they wouldn't go to strike.
Mortimer said: “The fights will achieve very little or nothing, but they will put pressure on the teams and services already in need of preparation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and manifestations (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hoping for a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility of education, further education returning from the Sabbath, training costs, recognition of the education programme, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are to respect the agreements reached with Marras, Himel and May BMA.
Two pounds of a day-to-day medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attacks are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
A medicine that prevents blood clotting, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or second attack.
The NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to a fat material accumulated on the wall of the artery, which forms a ash.
If the clot is broken, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood circulation from the heart by causing a heart attack.
If the clot is removed, it can pass with the blood and break the bloodstream into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already received one attack have increased the risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the Isobritan company AstraZeneca, and sold by the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the coagulation less likely.
In today’s NIC recommendation, it is recommended that patients be given 90 mg of taragrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective prevention treatments, even one-quarter of people who have a heart attack, the consequences of which are often devastating.
The fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective to calculate the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our recommendation, we are pleased to add available treatment options to a number of thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited in periods of more than three years, no longer than this period of treatment is recommended in the guidance draft.
The culture of political correctness allows for the flowering of electoral plants in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year due to corruption, giving a boost to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored in today’s shocking government report.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles set up police, electoral guards and city councils for neglecting evidence of electoral violence and the hypersensitivity to religion.
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains to protect the feared voters outside voting places.
He recommends that voters present a identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the person voting on the finger be put on an unspoken ink so that no one can vote twice.
They should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have a wider access to the documents and decisions made by the informal committees or the working group.
“This would not only protect the election, but would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the election plant,” he said.
The government ordered a report as a result of the voting scandal of the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting Mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of accusations of numerous corruption and illegal activities.
The Court of Justice noted that Rahman’s ‘censually distorted’ – the religious feelings of his Muslim community, and the accusations of racism and Islamism by his critics.
Rahman said he had led his election campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were predictable or the result of the fact that a person was voting for someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern in voting in the vote of the electoral profession, where members of the high-value Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the identification of identity with the identity certificate.
He said in his report: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the parents’ will, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshese background.
\"It was preferred to worry that...state institutions had ignored this behavior because of the 'politically correct' race and the hypersensitivity to religion.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for cleaning the system, which included a ban on political activists being able to deal with the voting tickets that came to the post so that “vote of votes” would end.
The report of Theresa May also calls for more stringent amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for migration and compensation fraud.
Consider options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of a person who votes the unsold ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic national revisions to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests from automatic mail.
Avoid political activists from dealing with ready-to-post sounds and envelopes in which the sounds are sent.
Let the police put the security chains around the polls.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for fear based on the Law of the People Act in 1983.
Make photography illegal at voting venues.
Require that voting venues only use English (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the knock alone.
Sir Eric's gonna have the Great London Police Department say that it's... amazing, there's no criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court remained in Lutfur Rahman and his official as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities,” he said.
On the basis of a number of grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticises the inefficient-ruled inspections of the city councils’ voting agencies.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s Tower Hamlets sentence was a awakening.
Our nation has a brilliant heritage as a result of Parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral violence and the ban on the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation.
Crazy Kate’s wheelchair and other published images in Rio’s Olympics
This week, fans of Rio’s 2016 Olympics have gone into a mess with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double being of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer, who can go on playing with his own famous double-life – at least according to social media.
So in honor of the famous face of Rio's races and of all the famous faces on our screen today, FEMAIL has compiled a list of the Olympic athletes who clearly appear to be Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: The U.S. Men's Flexible Team member, Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate’s dual character found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain spring bump could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio twin.
The U.S. Men's Flexible Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter since he got on the surface of his pictures, where he seems to be scary as the Star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the social media excitement, the archbishop admitted that he had heard from the child that he was looking like Leo.
“I don’t see a great deal of loneliness, except maybe with a duck, Brady told Huffington Post.
\"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the alarming single-looking British long-sleeved Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnastic Alya Mustafina's biggest, expressive eye has been said to be a Cuban-American singer, Gloria Estefan's double existence.
In the pool, the Southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to Matthew Morrison for years.
Larger gear to the eye: This user believes that Nathan is an Inception actor’s “sport version”
Another long-term comparison has been the tennisist Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong corners and lips.
Russia’s shopping career, Yulia Efimovala, has the same actor Annalynne McCord, as a rusty skin and light hair, while Nathan Adrian, the American team, according to fans, resembles “Joseph Gordon Levit’s athletic version.”
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Description of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities.
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that “other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the U.S. football star and Dexter actress indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Wash-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile meets Gabrielle Union's smile.
The CBC Olympic Comentor apologizes for the Chinese swimmer’s death as a pig.
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth message of women’s 4x200 meters of free swimsuit was raged on Wednesday by CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast viewers.
The Canadian television company, CBC, had to apologize after one of its rapporteurs said during the race the 14-year-old Chinese woman's dream of being a bad smell and dead as a pig.
A reporter named Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions on women’s 4x200 meters of free sleep in the message final.
MacDonaldi, who came to CBC's screening team to bring the color, was heard to say: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese bastard, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second part at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that China’s 14-year-old swimmer was like a pig?”
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct communication.
China Ai Yanhania was described in the women's free swimsuit 4 x 200 meters of the message final as follows: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese cottage, baby-
The review of Byron Macronaldi on Twitter was tough and quick, when many people challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how uninterested Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the shipment of CBC, apologized to MacDonald’s comment in direct mail, saying: “We are afraid that the comment on swimming was sent.
It was a regrettable choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.
CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and merged an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about McDonald's comments.
The TV company also asked for a quick apology and published an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and followers for an apology in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald asked for an apology in direct mail and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s message,” he said at the CBC Olympics.
“I took the swimmer to perform, not him as a person.
“It’s not necessary to say that I didn’t mean it to be disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.
Primark's customer of a stunned woman who made her underwear in the middle of the trade
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman got into the middle of Primark’s movement to try underwear.
The thing was not improved by the fact that, after assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman peeled them out of her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally matched four underwear pairs in the store, located at the Bouvere Place shopping center in Folkeston.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where she matched underwear and then put them back in the shelf
At the same time, the mother Jenny Davidson, who had two children in the store, said that when she tried underwear, a mysterious woman dressed again and walked away without buying anything.
He said, “People didn’t believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the trade floor, took a pair of underwear on the front, took off her own tights and underwear, and put her clothes on her feet.
“He didn’t even try to find an isolated place for reconciliation, he just stood there in shame.”
“All looked at him while he took off his underwear and clearly didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three other couples before he finally decided that he did not like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
“He didn’t seem to care about who he was looking at or thinking about a person who would end up buying underwear that he matched.
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone will take his home underwear, which someone else has tried, but not cleaned.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I was tired that the staff apparently tried to remove clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is good.
“It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has dressed them on top of them and taken them off, and they are not washed.
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale.
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Grand Master of the Krav Mag Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with pysy-cry-crying predators in the vicinity.
Then approached you in front of or behind, this video will show you how to pay the attacker at the same time.
Mizrach says if you're approached from behind, the first thing you need to turn is to see your attacker and the cracks on the line of fire.
After that, you'll catch the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with a free elbow.
Continue by hitting the knee, and when the attacker goes to pain the rifle, turn the gun on his hands, hit him in the face of the gun, and keep the gun pointing at him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the fire line, tap the weapon and turn it around so that the offender can't launch.
Put pressure on the weapon at the same time and strike the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun on his shoulder, back and show him with the gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Check out the video about how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you are not the Master of Krav Mag, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright is licking the dirtiest places in Europe for travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most night-long places.
Ian Wright, 51, an Ian Wright from Suffolk, a runner from Picccadilly Circus, a train toilet humidifier and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before he was young, he used a photometre to show himself and us the situation he was going to get into.
The experiment, which was made on the tracks of the film called Internal Force, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of adolescence of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey to Europe, Wright spoke constantly to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him in the mouth of another evil taste.
Wright became a well-known intestinal sustainability tester when traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from the public railway stations to the toilet seat's rinse-up button, was indeed tested by his immune system.
In the film, he said: “Since Lapland, I’ve been very concerned about my health, and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth from dust, worms, and water.
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the unclean Russian public toilet.
In his sample, he had more than 4,000 units in the photometre.
Because of comparison, the number of the hands that have been withdrawn should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public visit, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, an internal power trail, together with a Finnish makeup company, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
“This is the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in the toilet.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to take a nap because it's a night.
The tracks of inner power were produced together with the Finnish Meier, Valio.
The company offered the Wright in Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D vitamins that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the selection of snacks, honey and new categories said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking, \"Let's do it for Ian.\"
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell our everyday environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I also think that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the document, added: “Let’s say it now: if Ian had been licking some of the things I asked him to do, as a night-long Russian toilet, I would have lost my respect for him.
It was easier for Ian to understand some of the arrows, while the part was rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty kids saved.
In a survey conducted in 2015, 84% of respondents were specifically associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said they were at least using products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall, Saltashi, before the wedding
His family caused 50 000 pounds of damage to his rental house after they were expelled because of the terror of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the apartment in Cornwall Saltashi after they had been complained about several times.
Once they were removed from the property by means of force, the workers of the shocked housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
The wall was made of ammo holes, the floor boards were torn, the waste was applied to the floor, and the walls were buried with graphite.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Houston, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been the real nightmare for residents, and I think people should not live in this way.
There are a lot of points to consider, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is bad, and their name is bad.
There were three boys who lived between the property, and according to the police, the family's fear of fighting in baseball countries, the fear of close residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarreling and blackmail.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the lease agreement, received a decision on the insocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the fountain threat found old waste.
The property from which the drug has been previously transmitted, the floorboards had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and the police regularly called.
Cornwall Houston resigned by force from the property of a woman and her partner this week after giving them a extended period of time, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The light-headed neighbors thanked the wedding, saying that their lives had become one hell.
“They didn’t care about anyone.
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here a lot of times.
“We didn’t dream this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet, we haven't used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone...
The Executive Director of Cornwall Houston, Adam Fitzpatrick, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Roski and old toys have been thrown down to the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It’s a shame that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her family’s conduct, because the wedding is always the last way to consider Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have hurt neighbors.
I appreciate the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave, informed members of the community.
I hope that this development will bring something to comfort the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys lived in the property in different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, the dirty pillow left on the floor of one bedroom
The housing company’s employees now need to clean up the house’s surrounding waste surfaces
In 2014, the police made a race in the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as foam, supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for his guilt in the possession of class B drugs as a intent to divide it forward.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless after staying in Plymouth in private accommodation.
For many of the walls of the house, the graphs were ashes.
The police say they're trying to evict the residents who think they're mocking the rules of their lease agreement.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the wedding was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without sanctions, and to those who suffer from such conduct,” he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial use. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew down the beach in a hipping low
Sun worshipers in Portugal in Aveiro experienced a shock in their lives.
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion
Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, the flooded tourists began to be alarmed when a low-floor jet wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came to almost reach the distance from the solar beams on the North Portugal Aveiro.
Holidayers stood up when they began to be incomprehensiblely concerned about the noise of the jet, even though they did not begin to see what was coming to them behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the many holidayers who published videos of dramatic bypassing social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It went by twice as low as it was, and together it seemed to be falling into the country.
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing, and it really felt like the plane was falling on me.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared in darkness and flew in an incredible low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility of the smoke caused by the near-earth earthquakes, but the air force assured that no one was in danger.
The fires have destroyed parts of the Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to harmful conditions, the smoke caused by the landtops and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
The social and health border in South Karelia (Exote) made a better result of the planned EUR 3.4 million in January.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Exote seeks to shorten the rules of action.
Exote covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The Board of Exote will discuss a half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards swore by a military light in Immolola
70 guards at the Border and Sea Guard School swore a military light on Friday.
The military election was held in Immolola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Legislature course whalery was held in the sports field of the reserve.
The military oath was made by 70 men.
Special border guards are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, a special frontier man was picked up by 310 young people.
They were called 250 for selection tests.
Special frontiers have been trained in Immolola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the meeting of veterans.
The average age now is 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of roses ahead of the crime investigation will help investigate crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been a RTA or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
The Häme police department includes four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by the Sergeant Lahti.
He's the chief officer in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian person engaged in information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, according to Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different reports for the other police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of recent working practices
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the police’s working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police would leave more and less often the pills in the place of the wars only when they were alarmed.
Through the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established, fewer than three national units and each police station, with its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas shared by police departments, and have the task of providing information to both local police and national services.
Knowledge extends beyond its own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is responsible for knowing what is happening throughout the police department.
It also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because it also makes crime.
Those working in RTA have more basic ICT skills.
The unit seeks to attract police attention to new phenomena, product-like criminals or similar crimes through registers, alert task databases and observations.
This is called sacrament, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the work done, the factor is made up of a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals learn their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city with the collars standing, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals are not described as their own, because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus seek to prevent police crime-attacking companies.
The police will publicly report the conduct if it predicts a threat to them.
Such a case was, for example, the initial news, the labelling of empty housing used in housing breaks.
In it, the authors put the apartment on the outer door of the stick, a tie needle or a tape with which they tried to see if the inhabitants were really on their way.
The pre-research material shall be publicly available to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever ordering protocol on the right to fly, for example, may indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
The next time we steal, we leave the gloves in the hand.
The case has been interviewed with Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Officer Arto Tuamela from the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information to design practical activities.
Guarantee the reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
Schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British students who left London last year to join the Isis, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasime Akunjee, said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syria in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike in Raqqqa, a base of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to escape the war from the land and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a grave stone and as a testament to others that there are real risks of leaving the war area – that it could give people up for making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern school girls flew to Turkey, where they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she had married the Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected
The Senate's Democratic Director Harry Reid says he's convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Republicans of the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The President of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will elect a member of the senior right of the person to replace Antonon Scalia.
On Thursday, Reid said in a phone conference that he predicts, with a certain degree of certainty, Clinton's chosen Garland.
Reid’s representative later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “cry the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Appeal District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans that the name of Garland is the presidential candidate for Republicans, Donald Trump's hands, and potential.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is for women as well as for men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of the naked celebrities, they're going to find their next top model generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Mr. Steve Shaw, President of Treats, told us earlier this year that his high-denominated paper is different from the old school's Playboy because \"Playboy is for men.\"
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them.
“We must begin again to present timeless and classical nakedness in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body,” Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave images via the network or personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: Who actually buys disks?
Single, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you run into filling your comment with annoying insults, the author of which is the name of EiAllThe Middle Ages, sees that this argument is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of a lot of recorded albums is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the resuscitation of physical objects, but about the gap of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, most likely all of the albums are purchased by the age group of 18-24.
The question is not only about the collection of enthusiasts, but also includes the emotional significance: older buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I walked in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit on me. I'd like to be honest before I stop, make a cup of my hands and say something of authority, such as:
Let's look at it more closely.
At the same time, when Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies, now fill the buildings where there were previously independent movements - there are still a handful of great highly specialised record stores.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to a variety of men from some of these shops trying to evaluate their age and emotion.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (invoice: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (invoice: eight middle-aged men, one woman, most likely in twenty), spends her afternoon in London due to meeting, and spins the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
“I am,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums.
These records, which appear above the picture (he sent the sample by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge plate and single volume is partly the result of his available revenue: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and insolvent.
“A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, the albums that were released when there were 11 or 12, plates that I was probably too young to buy,” he said.
He agrees that the buyers of discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and more: “I don’t smoke and don’t drink much.
This is my evil...
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers that he encounter are suitable for YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the media's enthusiasm. People who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and who have come to the need to buy their old albums back.
On the basis of my discussions, people have generally got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their album back, he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl fertilizers of a certain age.
But what about the claimed sign of the albums?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that the record stores offer comfort to the same-sex types of the community.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly injured in the payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be ashamed of the digital world and choose to keep their trust in familiar disc folders; objects that awaken the memories of the teenage days.
“I think that sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector, I also admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers,” the other employee said suddenly at the top of the plate.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought vinyl disc in the last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, while 7% of buyers have no record player.
This is where the news report is likely to appear to be a serious concern for my browser on the surface of the bossa nova collections.
This awakening award is something that is also found by the Sounds of the Universe (invoice: three middle-aged men), 42.
“Someone came in a little while ago and said, “I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead album so we can put it on the shelf,” he said.
This is not a big part, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player,” he said.
Not parents, but younger people, late people, who are just excited about it.
In the phobia, where almost a full layer is now reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenagers and mid-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxing than in the previous movements - the sound of the sound of the freshest sinful and sexy pop of Wild Beast, and not the improvisation jazz - it is great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to show a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes looking at the various discs in the sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so it's not really an option.
“It’s expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is – he is in love.
“I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time, when I try to look like I'm researching cockroaches, I've seen a group of teenage girls collecting around Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter thought about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left, there is a staircase with the walls of Adelaide, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates of any middle collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only decorative, and some are so high that they are impossible to touch.
It’s purely “artificial.”
But given the fact that even a small amount of attention from these objects can mean more money for the industry and send some customers to Soho cancers to get more, there is not much complaining here.
It is not surprising that the population with more likely time and money is also the one who uses most luxury substances, such as vinyl.
But even though my finding suggests that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude it from the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They really don’t spend their Thursday mornings fighting around Berwick Street’s record stores, avoiding a rough 30-year-old artificial TV driver looking at this cucumber over the shoulders of the unwitting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the worst-lived vertebral animal - video report
Scientists say the Holocaust has a longer life than any other planet's spine.
According to Julius Nielsen, the record is on the face, which is believed to be between 272 and 512 years of age, which is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to cancel trades in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to remove tens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp with thousands of refugees.
In the course of the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to eliminate all 72 temporary trades, where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks within the camp, offer hair surgery or sell tea with 50 cents (40 pences), or sell simple food with a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Praction Agency argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent taxes on the unpaid parallel economy and because they are a fire and cleaning risk.
Humanities have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by a state-supported organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court ordered that there were no legal grounds for the dismissal of 72 people who were engaged in temporary trade, but said that the concern of Calais's prefect was fully understandable.
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding people in extreme insecurity.
He said the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the fountain threat was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are unprofitable and offer 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's café.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing a café would be a disaster for those children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charities of charity, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are considerably faster than average in the EU.
In Finland, food fades sharply to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of tea has decreased by almost 5% in Finland in three years, with an average price of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the highest number of EU countries with a similar level of pay than in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The data are published in the Information & Trends blog by Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland.
The page compared real wages, i.e. prices that have been linked to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the price level of 1994.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now the import ban imposed by Russia, which has sparked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also contributed to the decrease in prices.
The large trade chains of the S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
The consumer has seen the price competition as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland still does not have cheap nutrition styles, even though the price of food has decreased.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland for EU countries with a similar wage level in Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on the value added tax.
He found that if the Verrocco countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from similar countries.
Finland compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT would be seven in the vertical countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be half the average level of EU countries and continued price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
The Commission notes that the calculations made by him in the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
The school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all undergraduate schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan shows the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, teaching beauty writing is given up, and instead schools begin to practice coding.
Sweden’s education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher taught students, but now everyone should be active and learn each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting spine found - ice cream can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland hai (Somniosus microcephalus) known for icebergs reaches the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the most long-lasting spine in the world.
In the animal kingdom, it only passes the Islamic Empire, whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507.
Greenland's sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimetre per year has been observed, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from Copenhagen University, found out.
He set the age of adults’ ice creams from 28 females who had remained in fishermen’s fishing gears.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbon age of the eye lens.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish, 493 and 502 cents of amateurs, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
In previous studies, it has been found that ice-colds only reach a depth of more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fires for almost 300 - no salesmen are reduced
Almost 300 employees are fired from Stockman.
The joint venture companies ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant,” Stockmann said in his statement.
It says that the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann’s yt negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
At the start of these reductions, some 380 employees were estimated to be employed.
The reduction will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which will be expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining profitable goods.
Although the group’s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
Stockmann vs. CEO Lauri Veijalainen said that sales in commodity stores have not reached the company's goals.
“It is unfortunately essential to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018-2018,” says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly a good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best turnover and result of the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the total operating result of Stockmann was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s sales of this year will decrease last year.
The operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature of less than 20 degrees across the country
The centre of the low-grade material on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rained on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist of the HS.
In the middle of the country there will also be rainfalls, but the southernmost is pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees will remain.
Kenya’s general sports team is treating the dopingsandal - coach’s pace with a peculiar explanation
Kenian general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from Rio's Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as an athlete in the county team in a doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete, in which Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan National Team, said that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had provided a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities of Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use, Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked last year in the World Cup on the way to the fourth and has premiere Rio winners.
According to Reuters, the source within Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah was going to the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race.
When antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to be revealed, the source said.
Where is everybody?
the Rio General Sports Stadium
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least not following the general sport.
On Friday, Rio started fighting for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top figures were able to present their skills to a confusing empty audience.
Rio’s organisers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day’s morning contests and 65% of the tickets for the evening contests have been sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulsating people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
Rio’s Olympic viewers have attracted attention even before the general sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty blades in the eyes of rugby, noise and riding.
When Brazilian medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach flying ball in the legendary Copacaba, only 70% of the watch was full.
After the Brazilian taxi, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people were in sight.
At least the fact that Brazil that is struggling with economic difficulties is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match for the Brazilian football team was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
The reporter, Mario Andrada, said on the weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
“There are 1.1 million remaining to be sold,” Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million flags of London’s Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the flags cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
In London’s Olympic volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species in the school country, such as golf and rugby.
In Rio Stadium, there were empty places in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in the Copacaba sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Hallo competed in London in 2012.
The crowds are enough for the newspapers.
New way to protect nature - Get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation will participate in the conservation of nature through the newest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and communities can redeem the rights of holders in the country by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into traps that the loved ones can acquire against the payment of the holder’s right.
The fisher receives 187 square metres of his stock of veto, which in practice means that each holder does not require approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire administrator rights for several blocks.
Getting control is something concrete that can leave your inheritance or give you a gift.
You don’t have to go to the banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, the Juha Levivi fabric, which has acquired the right to control your company, is justified.
The holder of the management right receives accurate location data from his or her block, which enables, for example, a visit on the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the name details of the holder’s rights are provided on the same map as the country’s block data can be found.
The only risk of its nature conservation acquisition is that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a foundation of general interest designed to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas in such a way that they can be inviolable and peaceful way.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It is primarily financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also aims outside the borders of Finland and plans land acquisition from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Commercial Office on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves torture the great cities of Turkey - see the situation in your home
Bicycle thieves torture Turkey from the great cities of Finland.
This year, the population has been stolen in proportion to more wheels than in nine other major cities.
Helsinki Sanomat explained the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities, and their parts per thousand inhabitants, as calculated in January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, the tip rose to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti.
According to the police, there were four out of five bicycles per thousand inhabitants.
Only about two bicycles per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
That's a big difference.
“In other cities, there are a number of thefts in proportion to others,” police officer Tommi Reen, the police officer.
I wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The generality of the laws can affect how much the city is moving and how much the wheel is at all,” said the Sergeant Teemu Äkäus.
The police government, Tommi Reen, is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
There is a close center in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city, where city centers are remote and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police have become slightly less wheel thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of the year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 wheel thefts every year.
It means 50-60 each day and only around 4,000 wheels per year in Helsinki.
“They’re big amounts,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few victims report theft to the police.
Reen invites people to make a crime report about the theft of the bike, even though less than every 10 cases reported to the police.
A typical, well-established bike theft is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The benefits can also be found in the context of other investigations, when, for example, the apartment in the drug case can find stolen wheels,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught weekly by themselves or in connection with police investigation, says Timo Leppämämäki.
He said the wheel is stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoor pots, warehouses, and wheelchairs, in practice, from everywhere they are generally stored.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the past few years as well.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheel ends up selling through, for example, the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not come to the attention of the stolen wheels to go abroad,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheel are ordinary Finns.
Some of you will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be accurate, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or offence.
“The alarm bells should be played if the 16 wheels are sold to a clear area,” Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries a colorful Nopsa for his working day at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
She has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, Hirvi says. “It has never been taken, it’s been a good monk.
“Though this is not so attractive to thieves, it is not necessarily a hypsterical value,” he said.
In Helsinki Kallio, Siiri Valve, who quickly dealt with his bike, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stretched against the wall of the rail, but usually Valve locks his bike on something fixed, like a wheelchair.
“There is quite a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone paid about five hundred euros.
“Every time you hear from your friends that the wheel has been taken,” he said.
\"Mostly bad wheels, such dirty boys...
The bike was stolen from the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be used.
Under 15 years of responsibility for his crimes?
Helsinki is testing the United States-known peer-reviewing crews
In Helsinki, we will try the so-called peer-light crew to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
First, the experiment is applied to people under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The Vertais White Team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss the crime with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer-review crew in order to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter written to the family, for example, explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are guided in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes wrong with the first mistake,” the Institute said.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been introduced to the Vertaisval crew.
The idea is that after his first crime, young people do not face an adult panel, but reflected on what happened to people around the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Ikka Lovio, who followed the trial, explains that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on the road you chose,” Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalam crew is part of the Helsinki project of migrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all people who need them, not only to the migrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
The United States newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is directed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his infidelity, incompetence and record indiscriminateness threaten to bring to these elections a sound curve,” says Politico.
Only the movement of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump's decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is meant to be sent in the next week.
Among the undersigned are politicians Gordon Hubphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the individuals in the letter’s organization is known to be Trump’s opponent of the Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress,” and that is not the support of anyone.
The book lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which believe millions of voters to be trapped.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for the children of the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policies on Thursday night.
I want to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by a rich tax increase, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-in-hand for the American duunas who suffer from the relocation of the factories to the countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-payed jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it has to pay the income tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“I object to all trade agreements that work against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to the speculations published before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it was only a millionaires like this.
Trump's proposed race from discount to corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called \"Trump Porsaan\".
On Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
Such are Rio's viewer figures: Cats haven't glued Finnish tracks, but mobile app is interested in
Usually sports games are shown in television viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached the highest number of viewers.
On one occasion, the races have glued 12% of the population at their best: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Yle Olympic channel at the same time.
Due to the comparison, the EM Games of the month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2, and the EM Games of football were fairly another million.
The Olympics have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Top Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and reminds us that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time in Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
On the TV side, the viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing contests, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s shows will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lazy interest - if one of you thought it to be lazy - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the beginning, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is just beginning, as is the case with other Finns interested species: sailing and riding.
The numbers of the first viewers have been close to the expectations of Pokkisen.
When the general sport starts, the viewers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which emerged in Apple App Store on the first days of the competitions.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd like to make sure we're on the road to 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the world’s viewers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more widely displayed in Yle channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
On the Yle Fem channel you can track some species, and on the radio, Yle Püe transmits the races every day.
The Olympics are not only the most laborers of Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be traced from Yle's channels.
Since 2018, the Olympics will be visible on both the Yle and the commercial channels.
How deep is the lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland’s deepest lake is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical utility trainer, found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Cross, the bottom of which the diving computer showed 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to strengthen the observation by evaporating.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says Jari Hakala, a development engineer.
To date, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisvesi, and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“It could well be found in unknown depths,” Kannela said.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
In this way, your Sun will not reach ten deepest groups, and Suvasvesi will be even further away from the tip.
Decoration on 12 August at 14:29: Fixed last piece where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihainen from the tax sector: The tax on pensioners is still tighter than the tax on pensioners.
The tax on pensioners is still tighter than the wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the incident came out under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
This is not included in the presentation of the Board of Directors.
We think it should definitely be.
The promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter heated the opposition representatives in the parliament, who exacerbate the election promises of the Secretary of State Alexander Stubb.
The purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petter Orpon, tax reductions are mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, since next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the willingness of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally).
He says that keeping the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government period.
It has been done with the power of labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in favour of domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
In the event of prolonged unemployment
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it would seize long-term unemployment in the budget, at least to halt its growth.
In June, long-term workers were around 17,000 more than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of increasing employment rate is 72% run away.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died in the bomb attacks in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy invites Finns in the country to monitor and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who intend to travel to Thailand do not need to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy’s instructions for caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel to Thailand is scheduled for one year.
Most of Thailand travelers come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no record of the attack.
The ambassador assumes that events may be associated with the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the Constitutional Treaty of last week's referendum.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people who declared themselves opposed to law were arrested in the country.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, however, there is a conflict with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a great local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He said the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the day’s course so that the authorities are very accurate about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are local sabotage and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded in the paper at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
In both double bombs, at least one died.
In addition, at the village of Surat Than, and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known for many tourists, as it is through it to the Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of the military train in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he said to reporters.
According to Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finns in the country to monitor and avoid the most urgent tourist areas as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who intend to visit Thailand do not need to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the care of the high-speed guidelines, says Westphalen.
Europeans injured
The attacks and their victims in Finland during the night are known very little.
Last night's hit in Hua Hin has been able to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch, and Austrian.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded with a watch tower that was known as a sight.
Thai PBS says that the police have isolated Hua Hin in the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower caps, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There is at least one wound.
The Chief of Police, interviewing CNN, says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded every half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won a women’s four-game match
Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russian Alija Mustafina with the third 58.665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still looking for tennis championships in Rio's competitions with permanno, hyy and boom.
Biles has ruled women’s power in the last few years.
He had eight personal World Championships from the last three years.
He has won the championships of the four matches and the perms three times in a row, and in the last and second years.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two teams of world championships.
The darkest MM-metals in the Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism\"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will be followed by anything more wonderful, the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia will evaluate Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thaimata’s experienced tragedy.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these previous tourists haven't escaped the tourists, this is hardly the case.
Huovila’s company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's feast in Thailand.
The Patong atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open about 10 o’clock at local time.
A lot of people had not even heard of attacks.
In half three days, Thailand’s time at Patong was normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the attack site.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party discovered two men who were fit for the impressions hidden in the near sixth place.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership change: Clear deportation
On Friday, Russia had the highest level of leadership change in the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of leadership tasks is one of the ways in which power is exercised.
This is a way of preventing people from becoming independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in contact with other executives or screwed up.
The Loss of Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s internal border, will move on to the specific tasks of environmental and transport affairs.
On the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed that Vanoa replace, Russia told Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro notes that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi, from the Institute of Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change its vicinity younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarbulus.
The Arab and Kurdish tourists received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij last week.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city.
I corrected the previous news at 19:30 p.m.: Previously, we said that the civilians were running from the city, really the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's Documentary Policy is unlawful
The line of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the publication of documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that documentary publication cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the internal minister's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the guidance of the Government’s Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Ministry’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister’s Communication Director tells STT that there is a need for a reform of practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under valuables.
He violated his coats from the early days and had to leave the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in a much better condition.
I've practiced well and it's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-scale shampoos and fans.
Porina Bolt's bottom line is that the Jamaican star has risen as a period of time when the general sport has struggled with doping scandalals and a relaxing interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he retired at the beginning of 200 metres in time at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose your exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors in spite of the end-of-the-end celebration of 969.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin’s World Cup, Bolt reached his career at a lawpoint at the clock.
World record in Berlin on 9.58 hundreds and 19.19 two hundred are still in force.
In Rio Bolt, he has announced that he is seeking 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds of service, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt itself.
In Satas, Bolt’s very challenging is Athens’s 2004 100-year Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost the final of the values once if he has only made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final left Bolt without running because of a flash flash.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The final goal of the career, Bolt, has set the next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18 has provided a positive doping sample in Rio’s Olympics.
Chinese U.S. Chen Xiny's doping show found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian drinkers Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenian general sports coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was ranked in Rio for a quarter in women's 100 metres butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadato, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports.
Xinhua says that the Xiny exhibit on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also appeared in Rio.
BBC announced that the Bulgarian female drink Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia has, on the other hand, sent Rio home to the general sports coach because of the doping crisis.
The International Olympic Committee KOK announced on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test and had provided a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass for 800 metres of runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will not stop anything - historical gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps ui 200 metres mixed in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic Gold in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion for the second time before China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at the night of a quick interview.
Helen Skelton (i.e. on Monday) is the most popular story of this week on the website of the Evening magazine.
Next to the commenter, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t have much stress if the som or the British magazine has a small fit for his revealing and special outfits.
The television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has dressed in high-ranking shoes and short-sleeved dress, which certainly has at least enough visibility - at least for the eyes of a lot of conservative British soldiers.
However, the rear steps are not permitted.
It's important to look good, and small cases are just a fun thing.
Skelton wants to scare and maybe be ashamed, but he emphasizes that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the case has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do things and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skelton is refreshing.
You know what?
It's a mess of nothing if it comes from dressing (a driver).
I'm a little interested in this if you've hit someone's radar.

Tuuli Petja-Sire experienced hard Thursday.
Argentina's lady dressed Tuuli Pejari-Siren on Thursday at Rio at the Women's Surfing Day opening party.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted a breach.
He was stuck because of the cholari, and the others ran away, the Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete thought for a long time.
It was not worth doing then, because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could get a refund, Petja-Sire said.
The Finnish was hanging on his desk until the last, because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finnish was left with the colar to leave the 27th.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympics are eight.
There was little effect on the throat.
Friday is an important day when 10-12 will be played.
According to the first data, Pejaja-Sire did not make a protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that affect the health of a person directly or indirectly so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring him extra years.
Such are, among other things, a tendency to moderate body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong age.
You don't always have to scratch the milk bottle.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
Medical Daily introduced seven strange research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The Harvard University study found that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to the risk of reduced death, especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of alcohol, research shows that the use of justice - one of the three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinks were older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of the toothline can prolong the life of a person for up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
However, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person’s life.
Over 54,000 people watched the project last seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when sex protection is taken into account, is a good thing for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will bring additional years, it will not be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute solidarity.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big back, cholesterol levels were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combines these issues with a lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete or Oscar who won the Olympic medals, he was more likely to live longer than usual bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to an additional year.
Some researchers again suspect that a long period of age is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, enables for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who was shopping daily, or likely to become older, is likely to be shopping less often.
This is due to the fact that the circulation in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping has no effect.
Umpihman Ratty Jumped Towards a Truck
On Friday night, there was a heavy truck and a nokka trailer in the passenger car.
The accident took place in Koske, mid-Friday between Kosken and Sorvaston.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came against was on the same lane, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the crash, the truck remained on the side of the street, but exploded.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The passenger car shut down and then over the door to the roof.
The woman who carried the car in 1972 remained in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital in Turku.
The results of the women’s blow test were 2.02 promises.
He's suspected of a serious race.
Posti sent paper to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s loose sheet selection had flaws, as the post had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Wall.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia in Pernisto was buying bulk cartons from Salon K-Citymarket, when she hit a funny sign in her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in bulk, because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We will receive more when Posti is delivered!
If you don't fall in the lawn, it's locked in the sign.
The chaining sign to the trader is related to the extension of the Posti’s last spring services to the lawn mower as well.
Ruohonlekukukukuku is available at the Post until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mainly interesting and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the air.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, more than 700 divisions were available on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites trapped in a box bag, even though a couple of camps were empty.
The Jaakko Kaides, who was responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti Enterprises, was sorry for the damage to the East Sanoma.
The background is that three of the five sets were lost in the wrong place yesterday (the Seinjoki) and we were no longer going to do the partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we took only five stage today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanonom.
It was the first night of the evening.
Teija Halti didn’t chew from the sign because she found all her own loose cardboards.

At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then 10 pounds.
During the three-month gym, five pounds fell.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: The memories of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and adresses with a donation for police work.
The Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update that conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipo Zoo and also completed his training there.
The veterinary centre remembers the words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work unbelievably.
Good friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
Facebook updates include an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds go to police officers as a whole, primarily to the acquisition of security links.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old local woman was murdered in her own house in Loviisa Koskenky.
The woman’s neighbors have said that the victim of the evening magazine was very animal-rich.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder knew a woman and had nothing to do with each other.
Police dog Börje, who was in danger of life in the arrest situation, was involved in the tracking of the murderer.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal passed a judgment on the violation of the Law of Equality to Post
The post had no right to reserve the salary of the employee who refused to familiarize the tenant, the judge of Kanta-Hämeen was assessed in his judgment.
The right of emergency imposed on Posti to pay the worker most of the tax charged and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the Court, the Posti could only have arrested a part of the student’s salary, which was responsible for the whole day’s work.
According to the Court of Appeal, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his professional association.
The employee had complied with the resolution of the European Union for Postal and Logistics (PAU) on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During the last November post office, the PAU made a decision that Post employees would not familiarize with the infringing tenants.
People’s news first told me about it.

Putin resigned the chief of his administration - in replace with the Estonian Nato
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The place will be the son-in-law of the Soviet-Viron Communist Director Karl Vaano Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as Vice President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close inner circle, notes the Kremlin’s special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself asked for a transfer to another task and proposed that Vaino replace it, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during Soviet spying.
Many considered Ivanov possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU’s jackpot to the game ban - can’t see in the opening of the Valoliiga
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England’s Valoliga kicks into the weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban was followed by English.
As a result of the ban on gambling, Manchester United’s jackpot against Bournemouth is on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to the Italian Society of Pogba.
However, the Finnish Football League FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season of the Italian Cup, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next seam is on the second round of the league on August 19, when Manu meets Southampton.
Flow's Greatness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the role of Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event aimed at the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the main stage artists is the punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is set with artificial grass and art installation.
We've never had enough to be just a head and a cliff,\" says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahde Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to events of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: What kind of event do the authors themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in the production of events that we think so.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the Authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell to the end this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year with 5,000 people.
This year there are a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because there is a way to finance it.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is directed in the vast pathways.
That's what we don't want.
Over 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been embroidered in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in a partially artificial environment.
In addition to the main and smaller stage, this year, 15 000 tents of people operate.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operation of the event was very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for around €20,000.
Last year, the net sales of the company running Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It enables you to create a “creator’s case,” such as the construction of that 73-metre wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the trendy young adult community.
However, the event has not been profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
We want to be separated primarily by content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit the world of Flow’s dignity: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment,” Kallio said.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a bunch of legends, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performer on Indian, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was dropped because it is probably the last time we see this in the gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's called on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's done a hell of a lot of good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in florists - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, the local time exploded on Thursday night, two bombs exploded.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were hidden in the flower bag and exploded with the help of the phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative, Samomer Yoosumran CNN, said.
From 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, made a much sound picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can look at it here.
At least 11 foreign tourists were injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on Phuket’s island by favor of Finns.
No one died knowingly.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bomb attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the local authorities, the case may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken action by criminal organizations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new forces of readiness will begin the battle in the first time in the war.
In the acute military situation, the armed forces will only be ordered after several months of a military oath, says the Middle Finn.
According to Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the magazine, for example, for the 5,5 months of servicers in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the training manager, the service will first be provided by the reserve members belonging to the standby forces.
No backup or reserve owners are assigned a task that has not been assigned to the required training,\" Sonnninen said.
Previously, in the summer, the Defence Forces began to train backups to the units of immediate readiness next year.
Units may be used in military operations as soon as necessary during military training.
Pamela Tola got a jackpot from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-wife, Pauli Waroma, have won the fine dispute from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trading, however, there was a serious humidity problem in the house, which caused dangerous microbi growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case and demanded a discount from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the flyer and the hottie.
The court passed a judgment on the case Wednesday.
It was held in force by the District Court of Appeal which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 3444 for the costs of trial and investigation of the couple.
The right to a small reduction in the price, since some of the household repair needs had already been known to the purchasers when making a housing transaction.
According to the court law, the building errors were substantially more serious than the building errors that had been presented.
Tola is looking for a home of good fortune.
Tola said in the courtroom that the couple had been looking for a home of good fortunes because they did not want to take repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was repaired and in good condition, and there is no harm to the issues mentioned in the rehabilitation report.
The rehabilitation report referred to the risks and inaccuracies of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding and melting waters along the cliff.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that rainwaters from the cliff might have to be slightly controlled within a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the home’s moisture problems were much more serious.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses, was due to both a rock rainfall and a capillary rise in the land.
In the West, air contaminated by microbes could, according to the auditor’s assessment, be released through the receipt into the interior.
Health risk-optimizing, cross-border, or sand was found in wing displays in the housecare room, the basement staircase, the living room window broker, and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without a permit
The law also contested whether the apartment had been expanded against the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of Espoo to make a permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were central to justice.
According to court law, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a broader inspection.
Customers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the court ruling states in their judgment.
Karmiva archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also in the register of Finns
Christopher Andersson writes in his new article Dagens Nyheter, on how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have stored documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SSmen.
Most women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazimorsim.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under the leadership of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he had studied the SS doctor.
The same was even more true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The breed agency examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
It was meant to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency hand-written life stories and good recommendations from close relatives.
The breed agency wanted to make sure that women were \"children's loved ones\" and \"good national socialists\", who were well-known in German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride for SS men.
There is no record of the 14 Finns found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a government-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS person should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are told.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother's Honorary Cross was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between Arabs and non-Aryans were prohibited by law, according to the museum’s pages.
In the sixth place, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailboat of Finnjoll's day leaving Rio's Olympic Games, but remained the second flight of the day.
Nirkko rose to the eighth end after five departures, but the failure of the other leaves dropped him to the 14th place.
Tuuli Pejaja-Sire fought at RS:X-Class Day departures in 17 and three.
In total, Pejaja-Sire is sixth.
In the 470 class, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening of the day.
In total, Lindgrens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulin was recorded for a couple of hours at night: “I was so in the trunk.
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship bar to the Tangokuinka in 1995, Finland is best sold as soloartist, as well as the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää continues to drill and is currently in a rough lifting.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, published today on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells about her life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise in his defeat of the Tangokuin krona in the Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang Tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had prepared a tank piece, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it on a tape in a terrible crash and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the trunk!
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
As a huge hit, the capture of a song would not immediately think it was sung in a rapper.
Although I was not physically the best, the trace was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand a perfect and top.
One of the most popular pieces of the man, which is mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from her bridge partner and eventually ended up in the texts of the gold piece, which was published in singles in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Rõmäs were not like Sillanpää would have wanted.
The head of the bridge had imagined that he was making a record that tells the story of his own life, but the words of the separation song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, Jar and the ex-serious difference was said to be the reason for Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jari said it was a full coup and did not keep it in place.
According to the book, Jari called the album angryly and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the voting week's polls predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the power flow of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, the theme of the US former president Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupids,\" flew to the collapse in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
the Financial Cheharan
The Centre for Macroeconomics explores the latest monthly professional responses to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not heard because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the idea that the decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economistists, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists did not appear enough.
They were particularly discouraged by the balance of the BBC, which gave as much space to only a couple of economic scientists in favour of the European economition, as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's anti-Semitic press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capacity combinations have on the consequences of the difference.
Those far-reaching letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were heard and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not have common interests.
The academics like the economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also the economy.
The Brexit vote's overwhelming victory argument was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will rub your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments were made.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every health centre waiting room you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British have medical days if they weren’t?
There are also immigrant children in every school.
How much easier would the right British children get school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in each municipality.
How much more space would they have if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did succeed, their response did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are the net contributors of the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund booked in Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, a plan to win a B, or a camp that supports the EU, was started to be more prepared for.
Investors began to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily notation about the real estate fund that the news concerned.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At that time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds of the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
The real estate funds were therefore reserved for Brexit in a very different strategic way.
The funds closed trade
When the camp in favour of the EU was won, Europe was confused.
However, few weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney's speech by the Executive Director of the Central Bank of England, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised it to the main interests of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund closed its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the elderly, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down, and most of them withdrew the notice.
Since then, the market has been very stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks,\" Vanhanen says.
He notes that, for example, there has been no similar blows in the Manner-Europe funds in Aberdeen.
However, there was a lot of surveys.
Expensive attention to real estate funds
According to the elderly, the closures of the trading of real estate funds had a lot of attention.
Open funds that were covered by closures are managed by around four percent of British real estates.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on the 2017 side.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have gone down, but the situation does not seem more direct to Aberdeen.
The major issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
The price and dollar rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The dealer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of good buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines on the London real estate market
Two nights ago, the situation didn't look very glamorous.
But from four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, in the UK, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's where the power came from.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
In the office, normally unvoiced TV boxes supported news, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was the morning that he never thought he was alive, old man says.
It is not because, in spite of mystery, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, finished the day after Brexit’s vote, or two real estate trades.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote began with a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, Britain's leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate severe reductions in the UK’s real estate markets, especially London.
London’s office accounts predicted up to 20% of mines in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
The poison has now gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not look like the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the old man’s face.
In his opinion, it is too early to say a lot about what Brexit follows.
There is so much still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already received first data.
The CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London’s real estate decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, minus 6,1 per cent, Vanhanen reads.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987, and only five months had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared to the global economic crisis that started in Lehman and the real estate market in the United States.
The old people don’t think the comparison is quite a hit, as it is now a British home-like crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales such as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
Financial guarantees are also found normally.
The repair movement could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle of him – one could have been in front of Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of London’s and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
For two years, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall began to be very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the old list.
Britain’s economy has grown strongly, the population of London is also increasing.
The second major trend is that the properties are the last class of property that is globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have come to the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as a city with an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, for example, pension companies have been forced to look for returns on new destinations.
This loan has been easily available, although debt shortages have been used by the Vanhasen now clearly less than during the 2008 boom.
Spread, disperse
In London, the price rise fell last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn, and now it came.
What's going on here?
It depends on how Britain’s economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge the future, but he says that there is hardly any rise.
The feeling suggests that there is a falling or even way ahead.
Old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that we're going to make it work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have scattered, the risks are also scattered, olden says.
The S Group begins to register the purchase information in more detail
The S Group knows what you’re eating, as today the trading group said they’re starting to collect more accurate information about their customers’ purchases.
As far as information has been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to dream of the products purchased in early May.
The S Group is coming after Kesko, as the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Customer Register of Kesko for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S Group's registration.
According to food purchases alone, Kesko classifies its customers in ten groups.
The classification will be updated monthly.
Kanta customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they use.
The information is used for targeted marketing.
The product-specific purchase data is collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and does not have one of the plans.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer program, which can be associated with the selection houses, Siws and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group data, we remain at the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and on that day, and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says Anu Ora.
According to him, the client program is scheduled to be renewed in the future, but the Middle East trade will tell us later.
Ora does not, however, promise to register the product data.
Start with the experiment
SOK’s customer and customer register has so far been relatively large.
In addition to the personal and address information, the basic information includes the profession, education, the form of housing, the birth years of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded in the S-Ettucard purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been received from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Business.
The S group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash can't access the data, says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-pendu is Tullin's latest dog injury - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador's puppy snores heavily five boxes of the same country at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite game.
The box, which Heila sat next to, revealed a bit of shattering humidifiers to the square gas.
The flu is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila Dog.
Security situation and access to online trading
Heila is the first dog specialising in the search for arms and explosives and is placed at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Job tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing sites and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main job of Heila because the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Tull and after attacks have been confirmed,” says Tull’s chief inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to training of weapons and explosives in Tulli’s tasks is mail transit through Helsinki-Vanta.
With an increased Internet trade, up to 40 million posts are sent annually through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
Over the last few years, the customs has made online shopping at Helsinki Airport, from passenger aircraft’s luggage and air cargo, about 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In the ports, it will benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and spot areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Tull will assess whether weapons and explosives will be further trained in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in the Church
Heila-pennus training is coordinated by Tull's dog school in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defense experts.
The police have a strong experience in training dogs and with the Defence Forces expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vanta are Tull’s six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dogs Mass.
Labrador's inventor Heila has been chosen from ten puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog chosen for the airport include a raid and a hunting conversation, as well as a tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home at Suntion, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from one time to another.
The cameraman in the East Sanomas loses the camera's sword cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns a soft toy-looking shield immediately from the \"irti\" command.
Hard competition from the workshop
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the next in October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can see jobs on Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t be able to smooth the dog on the counter, like Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working parts last only ten minutes for hours.
The owner of the dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila was the owner of around 20-30 Tull employees.
Lucky hit the Suntion point, who has never had a job dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministry has its first Olympic medal - the people have a free day
The Olympic gold of less than a million residents in Fiji is valued in the country so high that the government has appointed 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, Fiji’s government confirmed that the championship was resolved.
The day of release is the next day of the team's return.
The hero team also has celebrations in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby Team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by a final in the capital town of Suvala, where the stadium had been erected.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in the Chinese restaurants, I heard them encouraging, said Maikele Seru Guardian, reporter of the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish player passed out after the execution of the hurricane
Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the punishments, he has fainted several times.
No one has been able to tell you why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of work in Rio and 145 pounds of temp.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get a last of 175 pounds, as well as another.
In the third company, the weight rose as a result of a fierce scream.
The body was under pressure until the jury accepted the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finns is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires a viroist Prosan - Veikkausliga - Ilta-Sanomat
The male football player Rovaniemi Palloseura has concluded a long-lasting agreement with the Estonian rapist Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a team of top players with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With more than ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
The small village began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, the RoPS coach, Juha Malinen, said in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the winter Flora, where she made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinjo where the Rovaniers meet with the ruling Finnish Master SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker, when Alexander Kokko, the last-time secular king, moved to Australia.
The Victim Modern Family Star meets again: Teen Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphyna, is remodeled by the modern Family comedy, again by showing his wonderful body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave a lot of imagination behind.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's feet, but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has put up a lot of tattoos in the pictures published in social media.
A young woman has also been shown to dress up in very scarce homes.
Winter at the threshold of adultity has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter had changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter had a typical change in Hollywood.
He has been on television for almost the entire life of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he reveals the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News, and more that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has become nervous about some of his long-term fans with an image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some women’s fans, however, defend an actor and urge them not to care for criticism.
You look great!
Just as the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, you're an inspiration for a young woman.
The Japanese prefer Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the revolving fire: Autumn is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the rerun tours from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese revolving tourism.
Revon lights are the cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter excursions have great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the renovation season begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revulsant lights, making the vision of two layers of random, according to Visit Finland v. Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the visit to Finland’s renovative campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese, however, would like to have clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lindin, this revonuli has enormous potential.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice a year in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is satisfied with Rugbyhopean Fid’s master course in gold
The impressive progress of the UK in the Rugby tournament collapsed Fidz to present the last challenge in the final Thursday evening, when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing phase at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master course in the process of processing, breakouts, drawings, supporting games, running lines and bridges when it comes to winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
Tapio was accompanied by a reasonable consolation from the shopping industry - from the third of the UK day - and they were proud of their hard work at the start of the Olympic Rugby, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Previously, the hard 7-5 profits of the semifinal played on the same day from South Africa could have plagued them in the final.
In spite of this, Fidi would have won a top 15-person team in this state.
The Great Britain may, perhaps, but probably not, comfort the fact that at least one British has a gold medal in its neck tomorrow: Fid’s chief coach is Ben Ryan, the former English boss of Wimbledon.
The UK trip has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, when Ryan was trained, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they only lost one.
It hurts, but development is shocking.
Fidi began to fight Britain’s fights because of the interest.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the goal area.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right level led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant attack stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawan from making the third goal, but it was just a slow hit for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal in the right corner, and the UK was 17-0.
Nakarawa once again made the goal of a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute...the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravovovou fell through the Great Britain's discovery of the fights and ran to the line to make a goal.
After the landing, the situation was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain just taught the game.
And that's how it really is.
The United Kingdom made a dozen changes in the pause that suppressed the Fid's dam... for four minutes, which was well compared to the first half until Joshua Tuisova made the goal after Fid's impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton took the goal to the UK in the left corner of Touchdown and narrowed the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost for the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved the flags and danced in the views.
It was hard not to admire Fid's cheerful approach.
Matta Vilame was last painted at the goal of the last minute was a snoring in Fid's cake, which did not need a peeling.
The pill was rained, the Philistines hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, totally hit.
The same day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semifinal 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a strict semifinal, where both made one goal - Britain's goal pot solved the game.
Kyle Brown took the South African leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling footjob and made the goal of painting under the other half.
A great late match from Marcus Watson, the brother of the 15-aside-rugby team Anthony, secured victory and finally a shopping pool.
The coach's fight against cancer was carried out by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
In these races there will be no more feelings of gold, and that means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard cuts towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning of their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they fought alone, there were three votes in the boat. Coach Robin Williams' cake was present all the time, when the twins in their second consecutive Olympics in a women's double race – the first women in British sports history books that are up to that achievement.
Their leadership was perfect, and this was the most unsatisfied of their 39th appearance, which is record.
This, what we see, two great athletes connecting on the surface with a bow lock, is not entirely a picture of the nature of victory.
There are a group of helpful hand pairs behind each row of wars that gradually promote the things that matter. None of the hands were as essential as the coach who did not know if he would live until this day after 30 months of the cancer diagnosis.
As he said, the situation was a mess.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the triangle was fortunate to be able to start its treatment outside the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if this expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
That encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department at 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Warming yourself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple thought was Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervous system.
Stanning, an experienced commander of the Afghan command, said: “I’ve been a tunnel union this week, which may be a little overrearing, but this means so much to me.
It only emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, we have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he has great thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't imagine a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition for five years.
The couple put a rough rhythm into which their competitors did not reach it.
Even on the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen cried in the process, stay in the process.
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we tried to do nothing special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on it.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
This feels so much better, he said.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland organises early parliamentary elections in October, which are already required by the protestors who have been raped by Panama’s information leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed taxes on several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last rage of the people affects the election result of the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, the criticism of the rulings clearly appeared, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and democratic candidate of the terrorist organization Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry with the speech and asked for an apology from Trump.
The commander of the army should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's quote.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini swimsuit that is popular for Muslims on swimming beaches, including the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beach and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a swimming suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming homes, which express a high level of religious links, can increase the risk of order disruptions in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, the two extremists, connected to Isis, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the swimming water in the Oulu area passed through the seula - Lake Pykösjärvi blue-colding samurai
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only a blue sea has been detected on the Pykösjärvi beach.
The environmental action of the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public swimming beaches in the Oulu region during Tuesday and mid-week.
With the exception of the seaniemi coast, the concentrations of all enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters of the bathing areas of the bathing areas of the bathing areas of the bathing areas under the limits set by the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of the coastal water of Merinieme were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the limits of action.
The bluefinery observed on the shore of the lake of the lake of the pyyskörvi does not yet make the water unsaturated, but in favorable conditions, the situation may change rapidly as blue-skinned ham, when the surface of the water is formed with a blue-green rest.
Environmental measures will follow the case through enhanced inspections.
If the bluefin tuna is transformed into a blue whirlpool, it will also be reported separately on the pool reporting table.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
M.K.'s Jäärainen for the reduction of forest gifts: more than 80% of forest owners outside
Metsä gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: promoting the generation of forest farms, youthing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest farms and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurship.
The forest owner would reduce the clean income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commented Juha Päärainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds a critical tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts is a task for the clean capital income of the forestowner.
It is a capital income that has been reduced to all other losses.
The effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The proposal for a VM leaves the source of a reduction in the clean income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of the share income of the forestry sector from being reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if it was not sold.
The calculation model is completely complex.
The average forest owner is unable to imagine it,” says Tuurainen.
The model also applies to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit attached to the forest’s yield value is EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn to a little bit too high.
As such, he said 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest stock distribution, he said.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing space.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been carried out by Päärainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MKK, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful raemuraro surprised the drivers with Himanga - two cars were stuck in the stream and bumped into each other.
In the Kalajoki Himanga, there was a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two cars were in a row, and after which they ran after him.
According to Harri Püühti, a friend-in-law's firefighter, the wind-up is suspected of being driven by a powerful shattering.
In the back of time there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himangas to a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
New research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer cancer increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells, in addition to the cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology on 4 August.
Muhko's family home injury continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another person.
In the case of both sentenced persons, the fall of the Muhok family home is continued.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for a family home in Muho.
The second one received 8 months of killing as a young person and a serious robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment as a young person for murder and gross robbery.
The sentenced person was also convicted of a serious threat to road safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle as a young person.
The judge, prosecutors and a man convicted of a more severe sentence, complained of the judgment of the judge.
The prosecutor demands a lesser sentence for murder committed as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to a court law, 17-year-old youngsters killed a school house as a child protection director in the last July of the year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder, according to the grounds of the judgment, attacked the director who was sitting on the couch in the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of the sample and to withstand the young person in his room, when another young man hit him on a hole in the hole.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind study, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world’s longest-aged spine, growing only at 156 years of age
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by ice-cream, according to a study published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark around Greenland, the Holocaust can live up to 400 years old.
The female will only grow at 156 years of age.
I'd rather live more than a centimeter per year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to last longer.
The researchers found out the age of the radio-carbon race.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, though the throw in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state’s tax revenue would not be received if the change in Donald Trump’s corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the most expensive tax relief.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax fell from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting, it would be a huge amount of $1,000 a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be fully surrendered.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation in the business sector and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The final environmental standards for emergency systems must be renewed and the energy regulation must be dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health reform needs to be discussed again.
The Board shall appoint experts instead of bureaucrats.
According to Trump, trade policy is the main cause of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be released.
For imports, 45% of China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new cloud builders all over the country.
By the way, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though the well-organized protests cut it off 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump’s program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his program on Friday.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is in a fatal way, but the actual attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street - accounting with the past can begin.
It contains the heart of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work for Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a roskin's satiric comedy, before it was the one in which I live (2011) Spanish tourist career peaks.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a harmonious, sedentary love, relationship and family drama, with a mother-and-girl relationship at the center.
The story is a chimp, and we see a lot of it in a long way.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandetti) must be amazed at the end of the film.
In the form of a recovery and a long letter, Julieta once had the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who is a young teacher of Julieta, will rise from the TV-based series between Ommelten (2013-2014).
Julieta’s ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cage, but I would say that time is odd and verbally simple.
Almodóvar films often have a fair distance in Julieta to such a characteristic silicone.
It is a flat-screened, slowed, placed in good music and rather sad-like film, with ingredients such as ego.
Instead, the typical visual color is stored for the Spanish director, and so that it begins to inject a little bit more slowly into the eye as a pure piece of shape than as a functional dramatical power.
Diseases, deaths, or only sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for clothing: in the case of a no-person, the inhabitants will change from one scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, or the sentences of each scene, is not particularly appropriate.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is externally and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, Nobel 2013 award.
The Novellit was published in the work of Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, as a result of a somewhat consistent written literature filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally disproportionate to even more dramatic drama, as much as the big things - especially the pale guilt - are dealt with by the nature of the film.
Instruction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandintetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to make elections - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers will be able to ensure that the basic Finns do not collapse to the fullest extent.
However, the cut-offs decided in the spring are made by a rap shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (kok).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefits, pension, basic unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment insurance for an associative person is reduced to 400 from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Cultivated by Kuntavas
Why do ministers stress that there is no new surgery on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and will be the most important heat meter during the election period, not the gallupes.
It has been seen before that the monthly outcome of the government parties in different directions ruins the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallupit says that the government party of the Finnish people is waiting for a roasting drop, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
The Finns received 752 new mandates four years ago, most of which will be realized next spring the price of influence in the judiciary.
The lifeline of the three political parties is about the same as that of the Finnish people.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s visit to the parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
In the first place, new cuts will not be obscured by the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, try to soften the expectations of the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilka government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the recovery of debt during this election period, but the Petter Orpo draft budget will be committed to EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the locals, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and admit that the government is not able to comply with its own programme: debt is not skilled and not even slow.
The other one is holding on to the program.
This means new cuts to formers in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring it will be taken against the parliamentary elections.
Debt does not benefit from these activities.
It is absolutely clear that the debt of current activities is not skilled, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to relieve a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the meeting of the budget will prove unacceptable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt premium submitted by the left-wing Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The next year, unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a whole new debt.
This is the understanding of the centre, collection and basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of tasks to the King
Three out of four believe that the organization of children’s day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to the study of the KAKS - Regional Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic education, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
In turn, the county’s responsibility for the region is more clearly sought by county planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
There is no need to transfer the tasks of municipalities to the State.
A low-age racer ran behind the road after the police ran away
The 16-year-old motorcyclist was driving the police patrol out in Joensu on Friday night at midnight.
The police team tried to stop without lights on the motorcycle, but the young man left to drive the police out of the loop for a bit of speed.
The backway continued to the Sonkajarantatie, from which to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the way.
Even after that, a young man went running away, but a faster police officer ran into a fugitive.
A blow test for the driver showed 0.75 as a prom.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock fell into its stream.
The truck in the Stonelands fell on the lake of Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in the curved mud out of the road and fell on its side.
The rescue facility raised the injured driver from the fallen truck through the door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first pilots.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
The damaged truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant into peat.
Police are investigating the cause of an accident.
The old woman disappeared in the afternoon
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon at the Lahtikyla in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimetres of long, thin and good-looking women with white jaw hair.
The findings and clues of lost movements are requested to be played by the North-Western State Center’s hintering number.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the image gallery of the destruction of Parafest
Parafest-festival tents poured a shock flow caused massive damage.
The President of the Finnish Parafesst Association of Joensuu, Arto Pippori, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its economic feet, and the event will also be held next year.
The last performer in Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on Friday night at the end of the story.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations held at the city theater’s premises from 13 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program will be organized as planned.
The shock flow is generated in the lightning cloud when the rainwater and its weight triggers the falling air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the ukcos cloud bind to heat, and therefore the falling air in the air cools and its speeds towards the ground.
It is reported from the Finnish Institute of Aviation that there are shock flows in Finland during several summer periods.
It's hard to predict the route of cancer flows.
The cancer flow hit the back yard of the Joensu Art Museum at Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were destroyed, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the river who was transported to a mildly injured after treatment.
Air pollution is ageing in London.
According to the study, the skin of London is ageing faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study tells the Event Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than the age partner living in rural areas.
The small particles that age the skin are a very good dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kill almost 9,500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk their business in the vicinity of dirty streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.
Tractor's brakes betrayed a man standing in front of him.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor, and went to the front of it, the brakes of the tractor betrayed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not left behind, but the tractor was able to get a man from work to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further investigations seriously injured.
The tractor didn’t get any further, because it ran into the rocks in front of it.

Anne J Partnernen has been playing in almost all Salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now in Tampere, there are already six races going, only 2013 left behind in North American Carnations since Canada.
I was working in Turku and playing with the naked women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up the Salibandy National Team.
I was interested and here we are now, J Partner, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jpülnen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that wasn’t played at the SM level yet.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj ice hockey in the SM series, J Partnernen remembers.
The partner played the Salibandy SM series with the University during the 1991-92 period, the following three were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls to the championship.
Women’s SM series peaked in 1995.

Beach volley Taituri Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending a beach volley player at least after a temporary period.
The Grand Beach championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In collaboration with Kouvola Airport Ballooners and the Finnish Aviation Union, the SM-final tournament is awarded six best pairs in each series.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of Finland’s beach volley tickets for several years.
Today, the Hasu living in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope that as many people as possible can get to the audience on the weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven’t played very often in adult series in Kouvola, so it’s great to play at the finals at home, Hasu’s atmosphere.
The Kouvola area was lit into the sport of Hasu's rock and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started the flight at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
On top of it is too big toy, the knee protections in the ankles, as well as the gorgeous azlouds and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
At a small location, the sports club was a busy community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle’s beach volley was a natural selection of species during the junior era to counter-balance the indoor balloon.
The swimming pool has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
It has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that some day I would be playing there.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with the Piksämäkis Annina Parkkinen in the SM finals.
The aim of the second-red twin in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti.
To be realistic, we have a medal.
SM Gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws in a valuable way.
A weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of Hasu’s familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, towels are temporarily placed on the nail, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli went bravely to be a farmer
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk-taking, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working with her little brother Valtter Koli about two years ago as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advise brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing the order so that bread could come from agriculture.
It's been my case since I was a little boy.
I’ve always been very happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and well.
In 2013, we started to build a little bit, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells me and adds that he would not have done it if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli is to invest even bigger.
The work has yielded results, for Solomon's Koli has been selected to the top 10 best groups in the competition of the young cooking producer of the Earth's Future magazine.
At best, he competes for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time for eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, at a positive rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation measured by the cost index was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost index was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate at the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).

Snapchatin’s anime effect is criticized as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to play in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, a dog or a character that would suit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are simple, face-like vibrating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie daily.
All delusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticized by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or black mask or favors bleached skin color as a beauty extract.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens to some users this week, which gave them a hint of eyes, a hint of teeth and bull cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people -- a yellowface.
And they wonder if these repeated noms could be a sign of the company’s major problem of diversity.
The news and fasting spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had stopped.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a cartoon of Asians.
But racism for experienced observers was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others refused to be an anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student who was widely distributed from the photos, said in his email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that “It’s difficult to argue against a comparison with the most brutal Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not only yellowed, but yellowed as a result of extreme debilitation.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially older youth audience can mean that they are even more likely to expect understanding of the attitude.
In an interview, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an infringing picture of the user, it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.
On Thursday, Zhu, Chief of Product and Engineer working for the Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to the Medium and the telephone interview, he said he believed that the race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s remuneration practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly for the white male leadership and decided to write on the hashtag #DeletSnapchat (#PojaSnapchat)
“If they do not have a variety of representative skin colors in their staff, which is why they can make decisions like this,” Zhu, Chinese American, said, “or have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could be spoken directly.
Other observers share their opinion, the complaint to which Snapchat has largely refused to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, stating its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the rotations of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and take forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: “Does they really need more users like us to say that this is not ok?
According to the Congress panel, military officials violated Isis intelligence data.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel said the authorities of the U.S. military headquarters had shaped intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of Iraq and Syria’s war against Isles than the events on the spot justified.
In the Interim Report of the Committee on Defence Forces of the House of Representatives, the Interim Report of the Working Party established by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Defence Regulations, it was found that there was a widespread dissatisfaction among the chief intelligence analysts who said that the chiefs were cheating on the efforts of the Americans to overcome Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the armed forces at the Florida Tampa, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The research outputs that were generally accepted by Centcom leaders were typically given a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism efforts in the United States than the facts on the spot justified. They were consistently more positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community,” the press release of the report said.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our fighters in war suffer when bad analysis is presented to high-ranking decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
The failure of Centcom’s leadership is all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the below-mentioned problems in the descriptions and analyses of the main country, with US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrative authorities of the Obama administration had ordered reports to be compromised, it describes the analysts as having put pressure on them to describe the threat in a more positive light caused by the Islamic State, Isis.
“Over the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates from the main country to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack on Mosul could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis.
“After six months of investigation, this is very clear,” said the statement, Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top-ranking intelligence leaders in the U.S. military headquarters have manipulated the main intelligence outputs to reduce Isis's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence data from the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday follows a broader result when the investigation is underway.
The Department of Defense Inspector has started an extra, ongoing investigation of Centcom's inquiry.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican working groups.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an intelligence assessment of Isis and Iraqi security forces by Adam B. Schiff, a leader in the Committee, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process \"longed with the release of intelligence publications, weakened mood among analysts, and did not give enough space for different perspectives.
Schiff and Democrats said they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions on the pre-established or political narrative.
The Daily Beat will report on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s supervisor has started an investigation after the appeals of Centcom analysts.
My Commander, Patrick Evans, the Pentagon representative, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress's report as long as the investigation of the inspector is underway.
But he said that \"experts are in conflict with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.
The study has other follow-up effects than just what comes to the question of whether the US-led bombardment measures in Iraq and Syria are successful (such as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the main country to carry out an honest assessment of the military operations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The Islamic State's inquiry review reflects over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the resistance of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent a very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also in a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence data.
According to the authorities last year, Hoker’s group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against the processing plants controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy because it had built temporary processing plants to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the main country.
Centcom's bridge commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of war.
General Austin retired in April, and his headquarters became General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth time in a row at the women's landshockey, organising a mid-term review with Britain
The day after he had made three goals for the team when he won the Japanese 6-1, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American team on Thursday in the American Women's National Hockey team when he won the Indian 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound unforgettable, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
“I have no idea,” he said.
“I’m not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his paintings.
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they divide their group first with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning the Japanese 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived a quarter, and this game will determine who is first and second in their six teams.
First positioned to avoid strong Dutch, second group leader, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
As soon as the end of the Saturday game ends, the Americans have awakened their surprise success here, four years after they stayed in London's Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell for the first time in his hands at the age of 3 (his parents played the game in Drexel) when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he did not get involved in his final player list.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“A change in culture, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same job in London as we have now.
We've made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the painting at the rhythmyönna near the goal.
India had come into the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation at 1-0 reading until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball to the left of the field for a long time, then walked in the middle, and threw the ball into the paint, bringing the Americans to 2-0 wire.
Melissa Gonzalez added a quarter in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to win one of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
“We now have a good situation,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The Peace of Trampolin in the Olympics
Whatever time you are, the Olympics are on.
Rio de Janeiro's events seem to be a continuous and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympics themselves were a flame-reflecting message capsule, which is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper or listen to a conversation with a neighbor in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time and future heart-breaker of the Olympics with a smile, could well be one of the best known names presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV ads - if he were a swimmer, a gym or even a swordman.
But the Dooley from California Lake Forest, 28, competes at the Olympic Gold in Trampoliin.
Olympics do not light all species as much.
Far from the center, in part in the shadow, are the species that not all generally accept: air pistolamm, springs, ball, taekwondo.
We always have breast-feeding, long life.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the reduced attraction of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first appearance in Sydney’s competitions, its presence in the past 16 years is so little that many of whom I interviewed did not realize at all that it was an Olympic species.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the race, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not moved to the final before 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually divide men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna are defending London's gold medal.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain type of adventurous, partly due to the fact that the uncivilised ear sounds more suitable for the clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an inability fan.
There are opportunities for fun in the species, as is seen from the color of the endless pongs of the cartoons, but it also has the blockage of gymnastics and swimming baths, two species that, in principle, combine it.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a box.
The masters of the championship jump on a giant trampoline up to 30 feet, and they must carry out climbing business series (transmitters, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
Those who wish to measure have to go further, faster, up and over - sometimes until the goal, sometimes in front of the field.
They do not only hunt a goalline or a start-up window, but also, on television news, on the other one, on the other, on the world or on the Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and it can even get to the tears of the viewer.
But that’s also why watching competitions can be a little frustrating.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest.
Trampolin is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The racer rises to a new rise, affecting the gravity of the astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dream of time and gravity, a melting interruption.
It is as close to the zen space as can be achieved in the Olympics.
Women's Karsinta competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 13 (ET), men's races will also arrive on Saturday at 13 p.m.
NBC sends finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 a.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympics, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which most likely does not notice in the common chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be stared and exhibited (as the U.S. male champions suggested by The Wall Street Journal) then Dooley just waits for his new fanry.
\"The generation shows its mind - Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violence protests in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has been confronted by the violent opposition of the government.
They say dozens of protesters have been shot to death in meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable states, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have plagued the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went on the streets, requiring a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was unmistakable.
They said the police shot and killed dozens of non-armed protestors.
The recordings recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or early this year, show how security authorities hit young people while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the African horn in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the West.
The economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new train for business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken of the oppression of the government, the opposition of the country has been limited, and dissidents have been silenced effectively.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this can be changing.
“If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to show their mind, this will happen, Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia,” he said.
The whole youth shows their mind.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover the curvature of the power of the coalition governing all land use.
Following the much-critical elections last year, the ruling party with allies received the last opposition in place, and now it holds all the places in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this bitter and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past few years, can try to use shattering and rearm.
Many factors explain why, after years under the surface, bitter emotions are about to explode.
The first affects seemingly harmless: smartphones.
In the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as the cheaper smartphones have become widespread and the internet service improved.
Although the government would shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location of hidden network through transmission servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, oroms and amphas, will be better implemented.
Oromos and amphas are not natural allies.
For a very long period of time, the Amhars, who come mainly from Christians in Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and who live in alan.
But this is changing, too.
“We’re on our way to the organization under one umbrella,” said Multu Gemechu, director of the organ.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tigrian people. The nation covers about six percent of the population and manages armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for restlessness is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw the corners around.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“There is no basic problem like that,” says Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaram Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill the Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Etiaan Tigre region, Hailamam is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many people are afraid that this can lead to an increase in blood flow.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in such a fall in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have first been drowned by the government and then robbed by them.
In the follow-up attack, many protesters died, although less than in the last few months, and the period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for the visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new road to work, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the inner authority of Ethiopia.
And now it begins to become a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amphara, attacked the companies owned by tigers, and the hatred against tigre becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say protests put the United States and other Western allies in the position of clumsy.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for flight flights to Somalia, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to end up falling apart from their unstable allies.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a real balance.
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based-Isisi claims to be \"sarkasm\".
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign on Friday by arguing that he was not serious when this week he told several times that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also set up his defenders, who have surfaced to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain the remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following the announcement at the campaign meeting on Wednesday, Trump claimed the same more and more intensely in the interviews on Thursday, where he urged that his goal was indeed to say that President and Clinton created the Isis.
In the early Friday morning's Twitter release, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The release was a complete translation of the previous day, when Trump said he had been seriously accused of several interviews.
When the conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitz tried to help Trump shine his note, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this hearing on his ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the opinion polls that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought when talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
I flee again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm protection before.
Later in July, after he met a broad review, when he suggested that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, \"I guess I'm sarcastic.
This approach enables Trump to speak at the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then “to explain” in the direction or the other, depending on the reaction,” Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is attractive to his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter through a variety of lenses.
Instead of mitigating their speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more captivating in recent days when his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Survey study showed that Trump is going to take down Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid any excuses he says about provocative things, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faced an ever closer look at the presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his faithful allies into an uncomfortable position where they need to publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former Mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, saw a lot of effort in defending the candidate CNN's interview on Thursday.
“I believe that in his words there are real, political comments,” Giuliani said, when asked about the authenticity of Trump’s argument, according to which Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, totally wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allows Isis to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued to attack the news media on Twitter, which cools him every word and is neutral against him.
He mocked the “worry, pityful,” television experts trying to get out of him, saying, “They won’t succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he was inappropriate as president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a cute, just a cash-consuming place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue’s streets cost it too much.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup cake-shaped soaps.
It was the last time the locals have destroyed it in a middle-class town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
In November last year, Dr. Verb opened at Greenpoint, under the mile’s head from its original location.
The new Verbis has a wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same and there is the same unprepared atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbia is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of a new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, liked many things.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu, you can find the bacon egg cheese sandwich, and on the coatings there are, for example, capers and rubbed onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
No more beer is served in coffee, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady flow of old customers.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers,” he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that when Verb closed, he gave up coffee drink for a while.
“I realized that I enjoyed the coffee and culture of Verb,” he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee pair, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his common ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithful in Verb since 2003.
He used to work there before and always made the same order.
“Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly than the clock, I went in and they were making spices with my bagelian butter,” he said.
The photo, Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes its usual order, but sometimes due to a variation, he orders a tasty bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not wearing a hat for the soap shop that took over the old spaces.
In fact, Soap Cherien’s owners offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient for cold-boiled coffee in the café.
“I think we can still take the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint’s traditional Polish residents have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu to Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it up to something soon to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-frozen coffee.
It is possible that the café expands to the next building.
For many customers, they get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a customer and said it was unsatisfied when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
“I needed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: low-end food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked finely decorated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the Hanhemanamateur, and Maryland's chocolate kitchen.
On that day, his diet was less modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and dessert from the bone marrow.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat.
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights is food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of solidarity with their own culinary, they meet the supplier at the dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unprepared lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the 1929 Stock Exchange.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive butter, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered a meat fracture, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating a flat-rate period.
“The movements were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut murky, a liver murky, a papuracte.
They were made from a manufacturing material and from some low-cost ingredient that continued the actual production material.
Imagine your eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Come on, Coe.
“It must have been felt in the stomach of lead,” he said.
Years before the demise on American tables, especially in rural areas, it was like an eating-niin-salt-like-jaksat-outotable.
Women’s groups made food for male farmers, and fresh pies were served with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The American sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The Square Meal chronized the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of supremacy.
“In the morning, food became a central, annoying topic for the Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One of the most annoying was a new, affordable diet: from mysterian dishes, such as garners and drawers, became the main foods, and the box was a “a powerful way to use food stars,” said Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, was a sustainablely dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried with calorie volume and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy reason in the kitchen.
In also researching a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era of food, where fried onions were filled with peanuts.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said: “It was unreal.
The peanut butter is not suitable for baked onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
In the newspapers of newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to start as “budgetary agents” and to respond to the challenge of turning non-existent spagets like carrots into delicious dosages.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical taste pots.
Specially tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood in simple, iowan landscape food, he eats like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
“He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in almost a golden dining room on his head with a smooth.
He was a great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As stated in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economic nurse who had no interest in the taste, the White House became a place that did not offer only those in Washington, but also food made in the worst.
Many of the flat-rate eating methods were abandoned as soon as the country returned to its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote a book, they achieved a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating methods, such as how he could not throw away food.
“He was really afraid to waste food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said: “He even sickened people.
There was an incident of a windmill.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert that they had prepared at home: the bone mark that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called a skeleton,” Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give the name that appears to be modest recipes.
There was no bourgeois in the after-food, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water, and canoe.
Everyone drowned their spoons unwittingly into a stick, brown to the vest.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sneezed once and for another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: “A lot of mocked German nuts could help,” he said.
Gilead will be replaced by a lawyer’s expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. Chamber of Appeal has determined that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the legal expenses incurred by it in an appeal against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead released $200 million for payments after they broke two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success medications in Sovald and Harton. This release followed when the American judge found Merck’s abuses, which included false oath and other unethic practices.
In a judgment filed on Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman, the U.S. Chamber of Appeal, said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensations that it suffered when it was against the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can clearly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other’s right of ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of the drug active substance sofosbuvir in Gilead.
U.S. support forces say that they have completely conquered the Manbij, ruled by Isis.
The U.S. forces have been completely occupied by the northern city of Manbij, located close to the Turkish border, after the final Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish SDF, from the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
“The gate is now fully under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax statement, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10,75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charities, mainly Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his library, where he told his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Caine Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, released ten years of tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain put a measuring tree on economic transparency,” said Jennifer Palmier, campaign assistant Clinton.
As a contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to the practice, US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose any obligation on them.
Trump’s lawyer, New York, has invested in the audit of the tax administration as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
“Your turn, Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when publishing a link to a democratic candidate for tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit was ready.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues in 2012, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken the problem on Friday, a web video that brought forward prominent Republicans that call for Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: he published his tax notice,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column borrowed a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same on Friday.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
According to Warren Buffett, Clinton has supported a rule named as a billionaire investor, which would ensure that over $1 million a year earns a minimum of 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, which is located in Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax notices.
Buffett said that he also has a tax administration audit, and that Trump was not a ‘fear’ tax collection agency, but a voter.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s tax declaration for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced $100,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and silhouettes enhance the protection of the ivory of Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking to human jurisdictions - they throw animals with chill powder filled condoms.
Keino has proven to be effective, and several years ago the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has improved its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania to use a four-step way to protect homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed tools, we have noticed a change of attitude in these communities, and now we are much more confident in the fact that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” the Honeyguis CEO, Dima Bell, said in a statement.
The first two steps hold the inside of the intruded elephant with the pocket lamp and the horn play.
If it does not prevent the animal, then the so-called \"chilipilvi\" will be thrown.
The condom is filled with a chill powder and a mixture of the earth, and then the condom is rounded up so that only the burning wire remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it breaks down and squeezes the chili powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send the elephant in another direction.
The last way is the trigger that shoots the Roman candle, and the fire produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: The Jewish filmmaker criticises a hotel in Berlin that removed the Israeli reference number at the request of Arabs
The French, Jewish filmmaker saved the media storm after revealing that the Kampinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli reference number. According to the worker, this is due to the Arabic requests.
Claude Lanzmann, who wrote about Holocaust's Shoah documentary, was frustrated by the Berlin-based Kimpinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During its recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country's indicative number list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
In contrast, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke at the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there was a shock to him.
The hotel's prescriptionist said that it was a \"Thinked Decision on the Management of the Kempinski hostels\".
The reason behind the decision was even more gross in the filmmaker.
“The vast majority of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli reference number,” says Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case “a great injustice,” Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
“We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, the official said.
The incident produced a fairly counter-reaction online when people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hostel simply “is an inheritance for the claims of the Arabs.
“While,” said the second publication, which pointed out that the hotel in Kurfurstendamm street stands close to the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called the incident “notable” and “forgivated” by Lanzmann, Der Spiegel.
“There is no order to include Israel in the list of quick-choices,” said the representative of the Kimpinsk, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber-like anti-Brazil students.
Students took together with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo, when the students gathered together to show their opinion on the reform of the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber weapons against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to break down the student force, which led to the police using rubber and tear gas.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their horror plans.
According to the proposals by Governor Paulo Gerdodo Alckmin of Sao Paolo, a little less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing on the walls against temporary President Michel Temer.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protesters launched as a group to support President Dilma Roussef, arrested by the Senate of the country when voting for his official prosecution.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly rising 71%
After the removal of the packages, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have shown a large degree of interest in their transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“In principle, Iran’s bilateral cooperation is one of the main objectives of the expansion of trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to USD 856 million during the same period in 2015.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran rose by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
“The growth of the cable was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign delegation in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
“It is safe to say that last year’s record of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved ancient Persian civilization monuments in good condition,” he said.
Skott Callum Skinner hit the goal when Britishs hit the bike gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner boasted the honor of the men's team prince at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's team's triad defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of Sir Chris Roy, in which his scotch triangle was restored, the legend was proud of the young man when he denied the goal of catching the victory in advance from the New Zealand team.
Britain took shock-free four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics.
And they repeated the pace without delay after being placed in the sixth World Championships of the March race in London, even though Hoy has since decided his race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when the Hindus appeared.
Hoy's end also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which British trainers held in front of the scotch potential that has now been realized.
Hinds, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner did the Olympics in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British colony won a double draw of gold.
And after his tour, the Hindus was stuck behind him, but Kenny fell in the lead of the team, and Skinner held it.
The strategic change was a big part of the change in form, and included the driving of Hindes with a major shift in order to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize school.
The 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said: “Vertality is imartleval,” he said.
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment, and British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with overcapacity.
He said: “It felt like he was in London when there were so many British flags on his feet.
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten types of cycling both in Beijing and London.
If this describes the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
Based on the condition shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s urect, winning three Olympic gold in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that apparently on the holy day of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It's the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete with the next spin that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoyed this one.
The team is always the best.
We win it together with friends.
Victory alone is honestly so lonely.
“If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the ritual.
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest four-person, four-mile teams.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (2.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the times when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the same women's race, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Millgate Katie Archibald went forward in the world record time at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach the whole set of medals.
After showing a truly exceptional and perfect management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio races.
The background has been drama, the smallest of which has not been the end of the competition by the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexual and bullying charges, as well as by large individuals, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first-night competitions on cycling stadium, however, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation could be once again held true at its peak.
The future of Portland is questionable due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria's aluminum alloy, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when an electricity-sharing company at the factory revealed that one of the owners of the factory is about to conclude a distribution contract, so it is expected to cut all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier by the Victoria Administration this year that the support required for the operation of the plant will not continue.
The period of 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoan Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the meltdown uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Point Henry’s heel, which led to the closure of the Anglosea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland will lose money and will be under the threat of closure.
The measure is now following a number of years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently led to the price of production in the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum alloy of the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it would also wait for the other three owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Aluminum, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the operation of Portland’s factory to continue, which means that the physical power consumption of the meltless electricity will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements’, which had to enter into force in November 2016.
Agreements have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by the strong prospects of the future electricity wholesale market.
AGL said it had already been decided in advance, reducing the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the melted operation or to ensure the unfettered supply of electricity.
The US company said it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement had been withdrawn.
Analysts have been guarded by both the Portland in Victoria, and also due to the possible closure of the Tomago plant close to Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and about 900 megawatts.
“If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just the true-tv star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's chosen September number.
Kendall, a brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and was a model in the fashions of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday with his Instagram account.
“Looking at this deck in a room filled with loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the Kardashian style?), a hand-written reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem with Rob and Caitlyn, and with which all the favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended with a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It’s about almost every child’s television series, a cliche plot (Secrest says the words, I guess, that we would forget about you – with the credibility of the morning-limited suit), but Krissi had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this public.
This is because we have definitely moved to the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's grandfather Kim may have reached Vogue's complaint first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September is exactly his own class.
The number of Vogue in September is the most selling weight throughout the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee sheets than fashion sheets, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page study last year was advertising content).
It is expected that for the last two years, the pictures of the magazine have been leaked before official publication.
Previously on Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have actually been more “publicists working as models – than “models” that are celebrities.
Oscar's winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, which the newspaper described as his generation-sex model, would hit his first-mentioned category, he'd be pretty good with the company.
These celebrities are not the relatives or reality stars of the famous people or today’s young people who are able to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade’s publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
His true-tv history, Jenner's position in the fashion world, will always be dark.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and this colleague, Gigi Hadidi, calling them \"this moment's bitch.\"
This felt again on the surface with the Jenner Vogue deck.
But in dissatisfaction, rotation is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September number.
He is a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He sells you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications, behind the payment wall.
He sells photos of Cindy Crewford's daughter, who he took to the LIVE magazine.
And in his spare time, perhaps just to see his sister Kourtney and his children, he is a real-life TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 people are displaced annually from the Community legal centres, when the sector prepares for the impact of additional financial cuts on the operation of the extremes.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight unfair evictions and similar - are already being turned off in search of legal advice and representation.
The legal services already extended to extremists in the Community are prepared for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned off each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
“The Community’s judicial centres in the Queensland community are chronically underrepresented, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year,” he said.
People who go out of violent relationships with uncontrollable and destructive debts, family members of the population, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not need the help they need.
The federal government cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and to Senator George Brands of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State committed to raising the financing of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palasczuki must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged after the employee was claimed to be armed.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged to court that, according to the claim, they did nothing after they were told that the campaign’s head of operation in North Carolina threatened the employee in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described by former software trainer Vincent Bordin of the state campaign in Charlotte's complaint Wednesday at the State Court.
He said that for months he was waiting for the situation to be handled internally before he realized that \"it would not happen.\"
Captain Earl Phillip pulled out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee-sleeping,\" Bordini said in a statement.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the complaint.
“You don’t have to launch things to cause damage,” Bordin said in a statement.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate was angry when he told the public that \"the second addition to the people, which is usually considered as weapons owners and armedmen, could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was elected and should be elected judges.
Trump’s campaign said that the media had taken his word out of the context, and that he would not suffer violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for unsatisfied control, and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not respond to the comment request immediately.
The companies were unable to reach Phillip.
WCCB, a local news firm in Charlote, reported that Phillip left the campaign recently.
The call request submitted by Innovative Consulting Services to his consulting company was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The trial is against Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and leaning all over the stomach, not just in local communities and across London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the attraction of the London 2012 races, when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our people and territories benefit from the races.
The Olympics had enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities create 10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs, and eliminate youth unemployment from the airport.
As before the 2012 competitions in London, some will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready to compete and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billions of economic growth, as well as to leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme in time and in budget: T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world in five consecutive years, to T2, built between the two fastest runways in the world.
The team is now ready to implement the third runway supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also that.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trading and create the legacy of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Delighton is the Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse
For companies who receive money from online advertising, companies bypass advertising prevention programs are “cat and mouse” games, said one of the companies that manufacture this program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisers on its website, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update the program filters to prevent ads from being re-introduced on social network sites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website is exchanged around advertisements to make it easier for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now, Adblock says it's gone through a new code.
Ben Williams, a blogist at Adblock, wrote that “the gradual struggle between an open source advertising community and its organisers has been underway since the discovery of advertising prevention, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the struggle is a strong indication of how much grief the advertisers have become to the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in the last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost fourfold the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company is behind the advertising inhibitors of the pages on the computer, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps to social networks or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think it is worth investing like this.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it was its daily-morning tool to give people more power as to how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the content of the site other than advertising.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” the Facebook representative said in an e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman was left in a car in Switzerland because of suicide.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman was on a highway under several vehicles on Thursday as early feelings in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman made a \"unpretentious act\" and settled in the dark to lay on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, the police said that they and all witnesses who have been witness to the incident have been informed.
The crime investigation has begun, which is a logical step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
“But let’s see if any of the drivers are charged.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
It's left to the prosecutor,\" Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, the person who walked in the dark motorway was estimated to be unable to expect drivers to face a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released from charges for the death penalty due to negligence after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The Court noted that the police who had responded to the emergency call were in a reasoned manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday’s case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to live once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus’s past by using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus had hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide filled with air-developed conditions.
Scientists have previously presented that Venus slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have been thin, ground-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at early Venus’s surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation for life and rapid water protection.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 percent of the darker sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model Venus slow rotation reveals its solar sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that works as a umbrella to protect the surface of the sun from heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth temperatures.
The model produced Venus’s development phase a story similar to what planet scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have to be inhabited sometimes, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billions of years.
Its oceans faded and its water vapors burned in the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen fled, only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gases -- Venus, we know now.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach's nest
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of the Vice-President of Colorado Avalanchen and vice-president of the ice hockey affairs, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the team decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin to search for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have made my duty as Vice President and chief coach for the ice hockey affairs of Colorado Avalanchen with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I’ve been thinking about how to improve this team in order to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the Coach and the Vice-President of the ice hockey matters must be fully in line with the organization’s view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me of his decision today,\" said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed the first winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach of the league during his 2013-14 season.
He led the team to 112 points and a middle division to win, but Minnesota lost the first round of Colorado drop games, and the team hasn't made it in the last two years.
Avalanchen's games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 games, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card slot.
The hall of Fame selected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in Montreal Canada and Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue to negotiate and delay the strike
The North Sea oil workers’ labour struggle is postponed due to wages, when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The oil field service company Wood Group has been randomly organized by Royal Dutch Shell-led North Sea drilling trucks.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of seeking a solution to the current dispute,” the joint opinion read.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings all day from the very beginning of the week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problem.
According to the trade unions, their recent work struggle, which they say is the first to be in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ wages by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries in 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary space to cope with the decrease in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off their pay lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, when the company reduces its operations as a result of its major merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of crude oil, and this economic situation is exacerbating the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish parliamentarian, met with allies earlier this week to discuss one of the largest North Sea labour disputes of the generation.
He said the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just for the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country,” he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the last five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pelade Star
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of star rotation speeds in the Pljadie Star Force.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why the stars of the star group run at varying speeds, as well as how the orbital times are associated with the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its solar system history,” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Caltech.
The Piliadian star group is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now running at their top level.
At its peak speed, these adult stars eat large amounts of stars.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they bend the stars.
When the star expires, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation for each star by following the appearance of the visible peaks, such as the sun clouds.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars run slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones make pies slower than the smaller ones.
“We see that the skid wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Piliad starset is so close, it is ideal for a cosmic laboratory to evaluate the characteristics of the stars at rotation speeds.
“The Piliadian Star Corps provides an anchor for the orbiting of stars in theoretical models that cover both the kisses, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, and why the stars slow their rotation speed and so-called hang their ‘tance’ nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pliadie rotation speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
