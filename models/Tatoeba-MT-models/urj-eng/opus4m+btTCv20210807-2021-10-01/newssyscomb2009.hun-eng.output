The winner of the right-wing populists in Austria has a total of 29%
The noticeable decline of two parties in the grand coalition so far, and the strongness of the left populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, has been made by the Austrian Parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously immersed, has suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Mayor of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is ready to return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) at 29.8% of the votes, but lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which lost almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved in the history of both major parties in the post-Austrian history and, in particular, in the People's Party that has led to the forthcoming elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, leaving the ÖVP coalition, the population party had a significant advantage before the SPÖ, according to public polls.
However, the electors have apparently been punished for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible cancellation of the party president Wilhelm Molterer and the current defendant.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Party Council.
This development would probably facilitate the more likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two left-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously reached 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes had been voted - but the Social Democrats expressed fear of repeating the year 1999 when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united in 2005), which even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, will obviously count on this solution.
The Green Party came to Parliament, but it lost some of its popularity and fell from the third place to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four hundred percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be heated
If it could not solve the problem of Czech scientists who have filed for illegal bourgeois collection, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain threat in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister published this in New York after meeting with Pranaáb Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
“If this didn’t work out, yes, there would be a certain delay,” he said after the meeting on which Czech inspiration took place.
Mukherji said after the trial that the executing power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was convicted and convicted of a criminal offence, the central government may negotiate the local leadership of the daselek, whose jurisdiction is the case.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for release against bail and wait freely for judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
“It was recommended to appeal to the Supreme Court, it would be possible to rescue him,” the Czech diplomatic chief said.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is to provide the Czech party, the condemned, with “fair legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, the Indian party has already given them such help.
“Our main interest in India is to preserve the best relations with many years of leave.
The Indians also acknowledge this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the CKT, the Czech Republic stressed to its partner that the problem of Czech encyclologists was of great importance.
“We think it is a serious mistake to punish and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
The question of whether the Indian party was given a promise to deal with the case was that the minister had removed the answer.
“I had a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It goes to the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring marine areas can be seen.
However, the continent is not interested, but a spot that disappears in the ocean blue.
“The island belongs to Australia and is also associated with the adjacent seabed.
During the area as much as the continent itself, says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who belongs to the thirty-member working group of the United Nations Division of Ocean and Sea Law.
His boss, Mikukuka Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation that is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm are ruled here.
The seabed has a rich, barely known world in natural sources.
Oil, curc and other minerals can be found here, but also unidentified living organisms, which, for example, can be the key to developing anti-cancer drugs.
Seabeds greater than land
The coastal states are now intensively applying for new areas under the sea.
According to the United Nations Convention, they enforce their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in the Jamaican Montego Bay.
It is primarily about the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shores of the country concerned.
According to the Convention, such a country has exclusive rights to all the sources of the continental taboo.
\"Simplified, we hold the portion of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental sole, which is the natural continuation of the underground part of the sea.
On the shores of the sea, often two hundred nautical miles [200 nautical miles] go beyond the borders of the economic zone,” says Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission on the external borders of the Continental Board shall be supplemented by a number of comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has negotiated five applications so far, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
In the world, Australia’s success has recently been echoed, which has first significantly expanded its country under the sea.
But New Zealand also won - the area of seabed for the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times larger in the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries are constantly submitting their applications.
The “Montego Bay Convention” can be done within ten years of its ratification.
Where the continent ends, the area of the seabed declared by the Convention on the Common Heritage of Humanity begins.
No country has a single situation here.
The right to produce in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says chief Mikulka, overlining the fact that “the areas of one were legally surrounded and recorded in the contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific Ocean
Some of the seabeds are now part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is divided into other countries within the framework of the joint “Interocean”.
This organisation received the status of the so-called ‘traffic investor’, similar to investors in some other countries, in 1991.
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati on the Pacific Ocean.
The area reviewed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is a copy of the Tatra below sea.
It can be produced in a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich scene of polymetal coins containing nickel, crack, cobalt and manganese,” says another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the Division Macedon, presents another example of concretion.
A potato or a little fantasy reminds me of the pergamen with the magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present in hostage liberation
The Egyptian government asked for help to resolve the hostage crisis from Germany - and the professionals came.
When the situation became a comedian, special units were ready, however, they did not enter.
There are more and more details of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to information from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were involved in the rescue.
In addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police, and the Federal Criminal Office, its staff, as well as the German Technical Service, were also on the site of release.
According to the information of the Ministry spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not required, however, because hostages allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostages.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
“It was fortunately not done,” the Federal Ministry of Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight Egyptian escorts in the southern part of Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping in the desert of South Egypt, hostages were drawn to the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The existence of hostages remains unclear until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or any ransom payments.
In the meantime, they arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that released hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not express the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information was provided about the time they returned to Germany.
According to the “Bild” newspaper, five tourists and special forces arrive on the German Air Force Airbus plane in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress's lower house failed with a small majority of the proposed $700 billion rescue packages for money markets.
Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives has not voted in favour of 206 votes against the government’s rescue package for the money markets.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the program was not received by the majority of the plans to limit the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters were desperately tempted to convince the critics of the need for $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party's negotiators, called on the representatives to support, even if the plan is still unfavorable.
“It’s possible to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Dow Jones fell more than 6% and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were worried that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then fell again after the failure was made public.
Experts will count on additional major tourism in the international financial markets.
To enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate should be approved.
The directors register more and more bookings.
It is a good winter for German travel operators.
According to a study, the traffic of the following months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite the poor conjunctural prospects, the Germans did not find themselves in favour of travel, according to the study.
In winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in traffic compared to the previous year’s period, which was presented on Monday by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was around 11% in October 2007, according to the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates the total market.
The Institute took into account travels booked by the end of August 2008.
Because of the poor dollar price, travels to the United States were particularly sought, DRV said.
Here, the number of reservations increased by one-third.
Germany’s particularly popular destinations are also Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as national landscapes.
Most of the time they were looking for organized roads, Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised roads can be calculated more precisely for passengers than for trips individually organised.
Passengers can save money with pre-ordered discounts or all inclusive offers, added Laepple.
The booking rate for summer months was also very good, so, compared to the previous year, it will be possible to record traffic growth again - although another study says that less German tourists were planning to travel compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfestem
Without a break, repetitive Ballermann Slagers, liter corps and design conductors wear celebrities.
Debuting the Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
He is a blonde, television director, and wears a customized dildo.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the turtle.
But one thing connects us: We've been in Wiesnen for almost three minutes, we're already running into photographers and filling up their memory cards - very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli fulfills its destination.
As a Wiesn tourist from a white sausage trained to the north, my comfort still sets limits to popularism.
But when he arrived at Theresienwies, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears dildos or leather pants; no one looks smiling or awkwardly - everything's fine.
Strange views at the chocolate-stanna stand are only my dirndli ropes.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I was wrong to tie the rope: “You are free, you are in the middle, you are a virgin, you are on the right, you are a widow in the back.”
I secretly tied the mask from the back to the left.
“That’s good,” he says, and laughs.
Others have less drive around subtle flirting techniques and wear a simple filter base, “I’m too drunk to dress up,” with a inscription, and unspokenly showing their naked backs.
He was named Bob, and visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is long stretching the \"aaaaaa\".
He tells me that he has been freed from the contents of his former cart.
Right next to one of the fires that everyone looks like trash.
Bob is one of the famous “waterers.”
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Until eight o'clock this evening, the ambulances go through the scene and take care of the poor couples.
The nurses always appear in a team - four of them carry a covered fireplace from tent to tent.
This works like most visitors to Wiesn: Arrival empty, leaving is plugged.
Who lies in the alcohol cobs below the pomegranate, it doesn't appear.
“These are those who are completely ready,” he says to me, “one of the sanitizers in my question, and then in the currency.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was killed by a vehicle in Essex County and the hospital.
With the apartment at Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson on Friday afternoon, the accident occurred on Shenfield Road, in the city.
He was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Rome, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of negligence.
He's been released for bail ever since.
Turkey's diplomatic horizon
Before Turkey was willing to join the European Union, European powers burned from the desire to enter deep into the Turkish backland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands for one of the greatest relics of the failed Imperial Goals.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least the travel books write this.
The building surrounds the end of the perons, one-to-one-one touring at each of the front corners, and looks like a German rural town.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little dazzling.
However, in view of the interior of the shopping hall, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise has had this most beautiful gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghd Corporation.
Germany, the late future of the conquests – through this train leading to Saudi Arabia through Damascus, wanted to implement the ambitions for the occupation of the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts occurred during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by the Arabian Lawrence and Arab coasters.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station didn't work better.
In 1917, a shooting train exploded and destroyed the building’s well-developed roof.
According to the Turkish sources, sabotage was done.
Since then, history has slowly deteriorated.
At the same time, today, as the gate of the railways towards Analtia and the entire eastern region - at least in symbolic terms - serves as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Government's Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, disappeared.
The new policy is metald by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I landed on the Turkish capital, Ankara night train to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish parliamentarian, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the collapse, which at the time gave me the famous documentary film about the old world, the rhythm of The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is planned for the symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the past.
However, the AKP is a paradigm shift with well-known Islamic roots in the Turkish consensus.
This led to some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went to the AKP Cathedral with taxi, a ultra-modern, stone and steel, literally built for this purpose - which is in a developing suburban district, half ready for shopping and cafes. These are the latter meeting with mid-seaters - both men and women - to make a business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a dress, tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to help Turkey re-introduction into a direct environment.
“The Cold War has cleared the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from the backland.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose from the two.
He had to open it in both directions.
“But it is possible that he will be forced to make a choice sooner or later,” I asked.
“Turkey never wanted to get in front of a response.”
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here, almost machine-repaired: Turkey is not only in the Middle East, but also in its relations with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea as well as in the United States as in Turkey itself.
It is as if they wanted to convey the message that, together with Turkey, all of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on the eastern railways.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who looked at the recovery of this decorative building 100 years ago.
It would have been surprising if they found out that Europe’s ambitions are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting for the ferry to take me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called the sick man of Europe.
At least at the time, there was no question of which continent to demand this exciting country.
Lifestyles: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: Since 1962, as director of Guildford, Vernon-Tod-Handley (necrolog, Sept. 11) led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Kórus.
Based on his musical plans for the city section, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, next year.
In fact, only under 21 years of age could they have belonged to the band, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979, many of us were already at the end of our 20s – we were simply not willing to fight the choir.
The name \"Proteus\" (the name of the mythological variable) was in line with the determination and ability of the pathogen to cope with any bag they put in front of it, be the Madriga, or a piece of Messiah; without a ghost or with a large orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and we thanked the man whose inspiration for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Todd told us, “Let’s leave the music to speak,”
He always said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it.
Karmester’s technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never dictated or exaggerated.
Whatever the quality of music, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If you've ever lived a conductor who was supposed to be hit by a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I wrote criticism about more than 100 concerts, but never, no one was disappointed and often inspired by them.
Tod Handley was together with the greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those drivers who, living with his words, simply “have been gloated with two well-known battles all over the world.”
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to William Woodruff’s necrologist, he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he became the scholarship of the Houblon-Norman research institute... while constantly preparing for his basic diploma, master’s degree and PhD title.
Woodruff’s book, “Beyond Nab End,” was written by Woodruff, but wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, Professor J. D. Chambers completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was also awarded in 1958 by the British rubber industry.
In 1950-51, he actually stayed in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not possible to know why Woodruff has refined this period of his career.
J. Vienne Resino on the Bay of Wisdom
“I recommend the exhibition “J. Vienne Resino “Flamenco and Life” because photos of black and white documentary style are impressive.
The simplicity and strength of them, as well as respect for the people in the photos, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition is subject to emotions.
Resino has come to celebrate magical moments.
Second, the sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will begin its second-generation Jazz distribution.
It is true that the front was quite large, but the design of the new model’s internal areas is even more extensive.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to the predecessor of the new Jazz view, it has made a number of internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new charisma, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we go over to the detailed presentation of the new model, we have to tell you that the new Jazz was released six years after the launch of the first generation.
So, first of all, we can argue that the Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less known in Europe, but it has sales records in other markets.
For example, Japan, where in 2002 and this year, Jazz was the most sought car brand.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of jazz have been sold into the market.
The second market was the Old Continental, with an example of nearly half a million sold over six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
While in 2007, the Japanese company marketed 83,000 Jazz, the sale of 100,000 cars by 2009 would lead to a 17% increase in the European market.
In the Spanish market since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 pieces of Jazz, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total traffic in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary’s leaders will calculate the example of the year 2000 sold.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda’s traffic in Spain.
The company’s representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents a decrease of 4000 in 2007, i.e. 16%.
Despite the conditions of sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.6% compared to last year.
By 2010 I also want to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda's hope is that this can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid from which the Japanese company would sell 20,000 pieces per year in a world-wide context.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market distribution would be carried out by the United States, while the remaining share would be distributed between Old Continental and Japan.
The launch of Insight is due to be made in the first months of the year after the official demonstration planned for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all aspects.
The length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), the width of 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and the axle distance increased five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
The height of 1520 mm is unchanged.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger space has become more spacious.
The larger interior, on the one hand, is guaranteed by the new frame of armour, on the other hand, in the middle of the fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the packager - called double floor - has a total load, currently has 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters of the first generation.
Although it includes that these dimensions apply to the type with the 1.4 engine, it is 379 liters of Honda Jazz.
Some external changes can also be discovered, such as rear-west lamps or optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors in the rear seats was increased to 80 degrees, compared to the first opening angle of Jazz 67.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its rotation, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 liters of drive.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, as well as low carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The power of 1.2 litres of resource is 90 watts at 6000 speeds, and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 speeds.
This engine, which was 78 horsemen in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 watts in the previous generation, is now reaching 100 watts.
The 100 horse-powered Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The \"challenger\" -
To develop accident prevention technologies this time, Nissan from nature, just the inspiration from the world of bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents while mimicing bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C tool may be the first step to develop anti-convulsive technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center were built in Japan in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center.
Kazuhhiro Doi, CEO of the Technology PR and Research Brand, defines BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-level safety shield.
The robot makes the company’s products more complete with the ability to avoid collisions.
During the flight, every bees develop their own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety guard.
However, the role of this bee is much more important to the complex eye, with which he sees more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser telescope (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument detects obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to avoid collision.
“As it happens to detect the obstacle, the little robot immediately changes the direction of the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid collisions.
The system is most different from the currently available instruments, so that in this case the avoidable maneuver will be fully automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Andoh Toshiyuki, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the embroidery may not be directed upwards or downwards, nor can it be moved only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the conversion of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in a manner that happens in the case of bees.
In addition to acceleration and slowing, Nissan also used a rotation function to avoid collisions.
“This structure has to process the data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on past maneuvers, so you can only work with a few dozen KB memory without interruption.
This may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate collision prevention, which, based on Nissan’s estimates, can be involved in serial vehicles within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and more durable than lithium ion.
In the future, it may be possible to combine the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Department of the Treasury is beyond having a lot of investmentable cash, without a sense of reason.
Because of the crisis on their neck and the fact that Americans do not question whether they are paying mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game for \"Bad Credit Hotel\".
This is the “Ross Loans” hotel.
The description of the accommodation and, in particular, the reception búskomor suggests that we think about it once more, twice, and more three times, whether the time of borrowing really came.
And especially where we need credit, as this is probably the purpose of this thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but little detailed.
It's more of a comedian than a public.
But what would happen if we were to supplement the game?
For example, the hotel would have a room for our dreams.
It's actually something, because we don't dare dream about buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he would have a share in his capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley’s exchange of shares fell in the stock exchange.
One week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock shares at $25, i.e. $3 billion.
The accepted price remains more than 19% of the value of the securities in the book of 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the purchase of converted securities, providing a 10% return and exchange rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock exchange rate fell by 6.79% in the middle of 17 hours and ended at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate the transformation of bankholding into a company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley has approved the new status last week, which can diversify his activities, while being under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reiterates that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the corporate events recorded on Wall Street.
By the way, it is apparent from the conditions announced on Monday that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan announced that 20% of its shares would be sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“One week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely of stock shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks.
In view of the weighted average price, MUFG pays more than 7% for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return to a share is reduced by approximately 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its premium shares into stock shares in one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds more than 50% of the conversion rate over a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can make use of investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s involvement, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate by about 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance had been improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, a major attempt has been made for the group, as the stock exchange fell to half, while the cost of ensuring a non-payment risk has fallen to the heavens.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but continued to be high, around 12%.
One of the major investors' banks remains the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and after the acquisition of the Merill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he reached $15 billion: part of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa's Monday declaration, Quito
The reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This joint plan is for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, and the Italian Rafael Correa.
Following the pattern of presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He was successful in his mission, as 64% of voters voted in the referendum, according to the official results that covered 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the voters were unfilled.
A 50% + 1 vote was required for the adoption of the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, the two polls and billing carried out by a public body at the exit of voting offices proved the vast majority of votes with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa already spoke about the victory of the draft constitution on Sunday night.
“The Constitution has won a great victory,” he said, and thanked the Italians at the Guayaquil, which is about 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As well as the common knowledge, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilen President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the United States Organization (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. The main topic was a 444 accurate text, which included the principles of “new socialism” protected by the President.
The proposed constitution imposes the power of state to serve the economy, while maintaining the right to “design the development” for a country that is essentially from oil extraction by foreign companies and from the currency sent by migrants.
The Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, confirms the power of the Prime Minister, who can obtain mandates for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to the division of the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to live with this opportunity and will again compete for the Prime Minister's mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also included the freedom of health services and education. The president has already begun to introduce it in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, and half of the population is living under the minimum of its existence.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to Quito and Washington's agreement on the use of the United States drug-based tobacco facility.
19 hostages were released in Chad
Egypt's command was struck on the kidnappers, who had been hostage for ten days for eleven tourists and eight of their escorts.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmedly to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
During the morning, the hostages were released in Chad by an Egyptian comet.
It is noticeably in good condition, in the afternoon, around half of the four planes arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to declare to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburb of Cairo where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy,” and the kidnappers did not pay a ransom,” said Zoheir Garanna, Egyptian tourism minister at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19, 19 at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were involved in a fielding safarin. The group was then hurled by one of the 35 unknown hostages to the other.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian women) and eight Egyptians: two foreign drivers, four drivers, a border guard and the Agyptus travel agency organizing safari.
According to an Egyptian security officer, a 30-member special commander arrived at two helicopters at the site where they were hit directly before the flooding.
“A fire fight was formed between the teams. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled,” said the head of the hearing of his name.
He also said that a total of 150 special divisions were sent from Egypt’s Villam Brigade to Sudan, where they were added to German and Italian comedians.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We need to know that this result was not achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service men and groups of operations,” he said.
He also denied that hostages would have paid a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had arrested a fielder on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them were killed (including the captain of the GS) and two were arrested.
According to the army, hostages were associated with a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the affected organization immediately clashed.
Lettres - Most of Culture –
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the newspaper and the election campaign.
We can only enjoy it.
But we continue to forget about a slice of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to lighten the ridiculous amounts of the small museums, archives, archaeological exterminations and national historical monuments that exist at the edge of the famine?
Which politician reminds the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and the buildings of cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only translated three and a half million euros to restore the Chino Castle in the valley of Loire?
The Constitution of our neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Québec Association of Historical Societys (Fédération des societés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers in the history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics are engaged in researching history, as well as maintaining a large number of private archives and archaeological experiences, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with my teeth and protest with the final power of the drowning, when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and our esteemed cemeterys.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
State a part of Fortis Bank of the Benelux Governments
With a partial stateization, the Benelux countries have been in trouble as the first European bank in the US credit market crisis, Fortison: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in Hungary’s interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level in the case at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis's bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international financial market crisis for more than a year, and decisions taken in the matter of the bank can therefore be regarded as precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states purchase nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year, mainly insurance.
The shares of Fortis began to fall steep last week, and in the second half of the seven, serious crisis events have already occurred at the Institute.
However, the analysts agree that the bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt with its 85 thousand employees.
The company’s papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year-old bottom.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not realistic.
By the way, corporate management caused over-the-board market uncertainty about the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new CEO for the bank's head.
The financial institution also sought private buyers, but no one has applied for a substantial offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors don’t have to worry, they don’t lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients, no attacks on the accounts.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and also purchased leasing companies.
Rose in the hen
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to enter into a insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of the data on the purchase of drugs.
Data protection professionals are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
‘There is a data protection program that is bound by the consent of the person concerned in all cases by the use of the prescription data.
It must be independent in hand, otherwise we entrust the chicken to the fox,” says Richard Dicket, the developer of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicine, Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the customer’s health status of the applicant on the insurance fee and the amount of damages, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they will not be insured.
The person was previously sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from the pharmacies, according to the customer’s identification number, he easily acquires what medicines he bought in the last year and the program itself follows what kind of disease he has and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol reduction, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually untreatmentally high, which is immediately classified as a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program, some at the same time determine the risk factor number, so the insurance does little to do with paper work, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as combinations against migraines or heat waves, and are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-raising factor for business insurance companies, not the former.
The data were requested and processed by separate companies, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacists, would ask the patient’s consent.
They are now required by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are already working on the results of laboratory tests, and are also connected to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurance providers.
Before the Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers over businesses specialised in the provision of data.
Dick Richard notes that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his program, which would bind the data to the express consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned may refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with it.
And then the chickens are all referring to the good faith of the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
Trade is doubled between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the 9th summit agenda has also been dominated by this issue, with the rest of the global problems.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where it will mainly be nuclear cooperation.
At the same time, the European Union recognises that India is an ascending democratic power that should be given greater involvement in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator, to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This was not the case at the Marseille summit yesterday, and it was now the ninth summit.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, and President José Manuel Barroso, and Secretary-General Javier Solana, adopted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whom they agreed to double the trade in five years, i.e. to increase trade to over one hundred billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious goal.
In this regard, twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, i.e. air traffic can be dried in the future.
India wishes to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance the fact that, while the EU’s number one trading partner in India, Newdelhi is only in the ninth place in the EU’s partners.
The summit devoted attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned in all forms and called upon to convene the UN Conference.
The end of the Dohan trade round was also encouraged, although both of them have a large part of the failure to date.
The EU has confirmed that it will maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
With this, India also agreed, as well as the need to make a global deal at the climate conference in the future, and to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by fifty percent by 2050.
I would also like to hinder the rise of food prices and support the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister goes to the French capital today, where the bilateral meeting is about to make a deal about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, we trust that the French companies will receive 20 billion euros to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented by a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Bushmasse fair.
This year, the Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for 7.000 exhibitors from 101 countries, on 171.790 square meters, where more than 403.000 books are presented.
The Italian Pavilion opening ceremony represents the Italian Government, Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy, through the establishment of a single Italian Pont, will take 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The solemn opening will be followed by a press conference at the Buchmessa 5.0 Pavilion, Rome Struktur, where it will also present information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the Italian publishing market continuously decreases the proportion of foreign authors, especially in adult and youth publications.
A year ago, a billionaire missing, Steve Fossett's plane.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fosset plane, who disappeared from the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007.
The wrecks were found at a height of 3,000 meters, near Mammoth Lakes, located on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of the County of Madera, disbanded all the remaining doubts: “After establishing the flight situation, we sent a team, and now we can be sure that it is about the machine that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or on the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) reported that several hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigation committee was asked to identify the machine and to determine that it was really about the Belgian 8kca, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossett launched a three-hour flight from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found Fossett's personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs for Fossett's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was filed one month after the disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks to describe himself in history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth in a balloon: two weeks of lonely flights.
Three years later, he escaped the land without landing.
A number of records include the flight above the Andok, at a height of 15.445 meters, carried out by a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, at the same time original and definite form of hobby, with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, Mercedes-Benz’s latest “competitive scaffolder” with which the German automotive factory tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why the introduction campaign of SUV GLK in Mercedes-Benz, which is available from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The same advertising campaign with the introduction of a new vehicle has been used by an unknown media communication tool, including by means of ex-post plagiarism 3D posters, which have not yet been used in Italy.
The giant poster action, consisting of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan by November 15th, Corso Como.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the presentation of the car's spatial effect, in which special glasses distributed in the area of the new SUV, Corso Como, will be visible in almost real dimensions and three-dimensional form.
The image viewer will feel like the car is out of the poster.
After that, through innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK will become visible in one single way, so that it will then form a single form.
There is no doubt that Mercedes, with this promotion, is trying to introduce something new into the advertising world of the automotive stereotype.
Will you be able to get the interest of prospective customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
The Triveneto youth, they're likely to be excluded from the trails.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of all Italy? Members of the group “Ultras Italy” that has been following the choice for years, and which, according to the truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They've never met the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is the right side.
The protagonists come from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udin.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller syllable groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were engulfed on which the native town of the fans were displayed: they were taken off on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi suffocation team with the Levski Drukkers.
The Italian Football Federation issued 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were name tickets, so it was easier to check the Surkolo team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was no one in Sofia who would be in the process, no one who would have been banned from the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who have a priority in football, refused the ticket and the exit.
At present, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police, and then takes the necessary measures: the fans who were arrested or identified during the disruptions may be affected by five years of prohibition.
It is an international ban that applies not only to the visit of all of Europe's stadiums.
Our football hooligans can't get their feet into a football course.
Good luck.
But we also need to be afraid that the Huligans will find followers, which means that there are only 100 and fifty people involved.
“There is a need to strangle this fire, not save anyone who behaves like this,” the Ministry of the Interior said.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's selected match day in Lecca.
In Puglia there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will be held, and on Tuesday, the Committee on Sport Event Security will meet with one of the Departments of the Internal Security Service, the secret services of the Surgical Behavior.
\"Duce-Duce scanning and flying arm under the Italian anthem?\"
He expressed this thought in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to the Ministry of Interior’s observer service (post was held by Francesco Tagliente, and then Felice Ferlitzi).
Mazzill was the chief police captain of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzill says is true, in Bulgaria, it is not forbidden to feed Ducé, but that is why the behavior of that 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, he added the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country of the crime.
Until now, this group has not caused a problem. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s also talk about the depressing of the Italian hymn: it’s not a crime, but, if I say so, I can’t call it a good name.
