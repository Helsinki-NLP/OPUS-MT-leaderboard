Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists on Monday.
At this moment, the Kiev leadership does not want to carry out a significant political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiova and the West say were assisted by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops further from their present locations where Putin said the Ukrainian army were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militants is to push out these armed forces and their cannons so that they can't shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrm.
It was surprising that the group came from a very early evening.
The visitors were expected in two days, and the promotor Tom Kangas said.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hyphop-festars, i.e. poppy is not allowed, Kangas assures you.

Choosing: Super Raheem's spell - Mario's left in the shadow - Eleoliga - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he was considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lanella had an electric atmosphere when Liverpool, who was confirmed by Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian-made field of work in a completely different position than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was far from its top stream.
The Italian lost three high-quality destinations and fed only half of its sixth feeding sites to their own team.
Half players who have already accepted the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool-Manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona on the role of Luis Suarez as the second attacker to the team alongside Daniel Sturrridge.
Instead of the Balotelli, Raheem Sterling, instead of the middle field, hurled by the top of the diamond, hurled by a 3-0 win-free opening painting along Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with its power.
Balotelli 20 cents shorter English is among the opponent lines than fish in water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks the lawn at its best for an hourly rate of about 34 km.
Rodgers also deserves great gratitude for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irish told me how Liverpool systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the north of Wembley.

In rare populated areas, ovarian cancer is more likely to die due to delayed diagnosis and troubleshooting.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video for honoring their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia have a greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers went through the patient data of more than 1,100 women with ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer from the Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in a few inhabited and remote areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
PIENI TUTIMUS: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through female health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, at the time of the diagnosis of a woman’s age, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and women, the probability of survival at the time of a broader diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in less populated and remote areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside the city have a lower probability of developing ovarian cancer, but Jordan considered it possible to have delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment.
“The specialists in Gynecological Oncology take care of this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors in order to treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients who are far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the family mother Elisha Neave, who lived in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the city's railway station in the Park of Friendship, which is next to the hotel in Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its immediate environment would be set up in Osvitta.
The proposal is requested from the Environment Board and the Lapa Ely Centre.
With the help of a change of position, the city wants to allow tourism to continue its motor racing activity in the region.
It is intended to form a park area within the present area of friendship between the park and the river.
There shall be no more than 200 motor watches permanently between 15 November and 30 April.
The area may also be placed at the designated part of the tank.
The new parking area is also allowed for maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park for safari companies for motor gambling in winter time.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring in 2014 and the agreement is valid in spring 2018.
There has also been strong opposition in the field of shoe parking and design.
The inhabitants of the neighbourhoods have been angry with the vote as well as worried about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been examined and findings beyond the guidelines have not been identified.
The upgraded equipment is also more low-emission than the old ones.
The park of friendship is also supported by the fact that if the place of departure is extended, the safari customers of the hotel should be transported to the place of departure for safari with buses that would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
The area of friendship park and the surrounding environment, according to the city, are also large enough for the reels, better than for replacement slots, such as the eastern side of the Ounasjo bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, even because the activities can expand in the future, for example, in the Ounaspaviliong region.
The consolidation of parking is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient quality areas for logistics and functionally advantageous places.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for motor racing in the center of the public domain, which has not yet received the power of law.
The decrease of ownership is seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of residential owners, especially in the group under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, when today’s young consumers reach their age in favour of the garden sales main target group, the Financial Times, reported on the study of the UK Garden Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, apartment tenants use only 55% of the money spent by apartment owners.
The study also found that more and more of the highly urban apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases when the front yard is increasingly covered into a parking space. These factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to have an estimated value of about £5 billion per year.
In the large region of London, housing ownership has decreased from 61% to 43% in the six years, and there garden products are the least used per household in the country.
According to the HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), the increase in renting of apartments or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The RHS’s leading garden advice, Guy Barter, says, “for example, plants grown in transferable farming plants are particularly popular among apartment tenants, as such breeding plants can be included, if necessary, in their changes,
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the period of accumulation in the garden sector, as the ownership and wealth of housing increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will become more economical this year due to better weather conditions, since the last year's March and April weather weather has been worse.
Turkey interviews U.S. diplomat for spying report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat report on spying by Americans and Britishs in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy's prosecutor and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German Der Spiegel magazine and the Internet magazine The Intercept have written that the documents of the former American Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spying target of U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all major states have consolidated each other.
Previous report on spying at Ankara, Germany’s main intelligence service, provides a more hostile reaction to the Turkish government.

Mallorcan Magazine Police Chief in charge of corruption
The case showed evidence from the police and Calvià City Government officials on Friday at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The Calvià Police Manager, located on the Mallorca Holiday Island, has been arrested for a wet celebration as a result of the corruption charges presented by the traffic and bar owners of the known Magaluf Region.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in prison after several of the business owners of Punta Ballena's street filed corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is located in the majority of the Magaluf bars and night clubs.
According to the journal Mallorca Diario published on the web, the case showed evidence that police and Calvià's mayors carried out a blackmail at Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interviewed by the judge with Navarro.
ABC wrote about the impartiality of the hated authorities of the owners of night clubs, which made a significant difference in their business.
“There is no more money in this matter, but the survival, a business owner said to the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Alaluf was in several countries in magazine headlines this summer, when the online YouTube video was distributed, where a 18-year-old British holidayer had been having oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the humorous and uncontrollable use of the Malaluf holidayers by reducing the number of participants in the malicious, alcoholic pub crawlie.
In addition, the Playhouse night club, where the oral video was filmed, was ordered for a year to be closed, and the night club owner and pub crawl organiser Carnage were jointly ordered to pay EUR 55,000 fines.
Above all, the popular Alaluf tourist destination among young British tourists has also become popular for the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol use when people jump from balcony to pool.
The children of Israel return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israelites returned to school in the Gaza Strip on Monday after the summer bombings, when the rockets and grenades bombarded their communities in the war of Israel and Hamas for 50 days, and the schools remained closed when the battles were restored.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombings in southern Israeli communities, but the traces of battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south, in the Pashosh day-care home, workers removed chips from the walls and slides before the arrival of the children in the rocket attacking day-care.
“We’re a little scared, but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in the town’s name in the bitters, Israeli communion, and works as an English teacher at the school of the city.
Many children in this area need routines.
Bartin’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that the return to school in a long time would seem strange.
“We’ve had some difficult times when we didn’t leave home,” he said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited his support at the Kibbuts near Gaza.
Before the beginning of the last week’s ceasefire, thousands of inhabitants of the Saat’s common border regions had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Front are suspicious of the return of Palestinian kranata killed by a 4-year-old son in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, ten families had not returned.
The children of these families are currently placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was subject to a heavy Palestinian attack.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised to “care for the education and safety of children.”
Israel and Hamas have agreed on the ceasefire that is currently in force last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ request to remove Israel and Egypt’s island and reopen Gaza’s air and sea roads.
Israel wants to take away Hamas’ weapons and restore the body of the Israeli soldiers who died in two wars.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of the dead, according to the fact that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not kept evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including the Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to cover over 100 United Nations schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in the shelters and when the battles continued, the school authorities moved the beginning of the school last week.
“I hope that the school will open up soon and again get to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said the 13-year-old Muhammad Amara, in the school in Gaza.
According to the generally used meter, the prices of apartments have risen to the highest number of years in the winter months of Australia.
The price of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments in the Australian capital increased by 1.1% in August, according to the RP data on Monday.
With the rise in prices for summer, July and August, prices increased by 4.2 per cent, or more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but the prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
The results of the RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the fastest; the average increase in prices is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawles, spring began in Australia to increase the number of homes in sale over the coming months, which is a real test on the housing market.
“When the sales of auctioned housing, generally a lively sales pace and still a constant low interest rate are taken into account, it is likely that the house prices will continue to increase over the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mäntta
The new museum and photography have drawn record audiences to Mäntta this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June, and there has been, among other things, pop art classic works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
The Mäntta’s art weeks again announced that they had performed a visitor record on Monday, when 14 500 interested people had visited the event this summer.
These numbers have not been used.
The people have gone through the doors and windows,” says Pauli Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors throughout the year will come at Serlachius Museums this year to approach hundreds of thousands of people.
Over the past few years, there have been around 40,000 visitors.
The Mäntta-Vilpula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director, Sivonen, reminds us that new museums are always open to phenomena.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
It is hoped that the art period will continue to last far beyond the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened.

August was very warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Institute of Climate Sciences, the same warm August is repeated on average in ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Aviation Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual throughout the country.
In most of the countries, the deviation was one in two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the summer was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter looked at 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hated me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley, a family of the seven children from Jamaica in the British Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary conversation, developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The noises are a mix of reggae and rap in the upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face never appeared, only the voice said, \"Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a olethropic or the beauty of a crucet dinner.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley, and thus got an idea of what his father's life must have been like, even though working conditions are better today than at that time.
The vents are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smokey, labyrinthic depths, where the flames, smoke and nod and bring to mind the latter.
My father used to go to the bath and only the ground in the tub, and quietly he began singing to himself while washing the meltout out of himself.
As I walked around Sulattamo, I realized that he had done it for years to get us a table for food, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry’s childhood was lacking in the closeness offered by parents.
My father never hated me and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we started repeating each other's love for each other.
Henry has a Billie Girl with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he had for himself as a child.
Do you have to repeat it all the time? I love you.
Stop it already!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother's death.
When I started suffering from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's known short party may describe his change during career development.
After getting a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in the performance of the theatre.
The next time was the Erehdyssian comedy and August Wilson's Fences-Aidat.
Making a theater offers a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedys that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started working in the field when he was only 16 years old.
One of the tigers noticed him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces Championship.
Henry’s TV career began in the middle of the 1970s. “I was the only black immitor and comedian of the TV for a long time,” he said.
Henry learned how to work.
I was supposed to grow up in the light of the public, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the slippery bridge from 1975 to 1985, while living the purpose of life and being on television, it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the show rights at The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared black-headed, so Henry ended up in a comic show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I will not regret it.
Although my position was strange and depressing, I was able to work in huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Still, the award-winning, multi-annual favorite and lightweight entertainment program of the British-tv – was at the same time a bright parody of black people.
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the 1980s, where both was ruined and admired by the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character cook Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
In the next decade, Henry spent on advertisements, documents, TV series and film sections, but after his JulyHenry.tv series in 2008, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that you’re just on your trails or on the sidelines –
The next time was Radio 4's \"What's So Great About...\".
In the first part, Shakespeare was discussed.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn’t really well taught at school, and I think it was part of a white middle class that uses tights and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's topic raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, told me: “Kokee.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 songs about Othello's last speech for the document, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It felt almost like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“This is what’s going on, this is important, so take it seriously, teach your bag, do a small background study.
So the exercise process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The show was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn’t exactly happen.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part of the Erehdys comedy.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it.
At one point, the thought came to my mind: \"Oh, you've changed...
Once in the play there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that he had the task of entertaining the audience.
“A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’
Instead, the assistant of the director announced that the proposal will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scenery, and some of me would look like a relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
“You’re part of the play, stay in your role.
Henry-Fences - Shows in Duchess Theatre
The experience of the “Fences” exhibition was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign of gods; “This is what you have to do.
This is what Henry says, of course, in the voice of KOMELA.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comedian: small humor boys are constantly interrupting our conversation while changing from imitation to another.
The arrest of Stand-up is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to get immediate praise from an unknown audience.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it doesn’t inspire me the same way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to a new stand-up tour anymore.
To me, it will bring real joy to sit together with the director who will help shape the whole journey from the beginning, the middle and the end, and I will never want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.

Kenia will establish a register of officials to remove “muneration workers”
Kenya has started to establish a biometric record of officials in attempting to remove “immigrant workers” from the government's wage lists.
Workers who did not register during the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government's press release was announced.
The government suspects that thousands of people will be paid wages after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to harden the corruption of the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to the previous review this year, “at least a million dollars were spent on injuries and other economic abuses.
The government suspects that the salaries will be paid to the account after the person has died or left his official duties, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reported about the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register within the weeks of the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, the government's press release was reported.
According to the information, anyone who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the pay lists.
“This measure makes a significant sense to the public sector, as it defines how many people really work. In addition, it cleanses the pay lists at both levels of the government. This is how we solve the problem of “immortal workers,” says Anne Waiguru, the official of the Ministry for Dispersion and Design.
The result of the 2015 financial year in the wall may remain EUR 25,5 million as a deficit, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure developments in a harsh economic situation.
Based on the current draft budget, the annuals are about 9.4 million deficits.
As a possible means of enhancing the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, as well as the increase of tax and payment revenues.
The EUR 10 million target for investment is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, increased unemployment and a 5% reduction in public participation will further weaken the prospects.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to look for new ways to balance the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be achieved.
The ship must be translated into the strategy's goal,” said Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted submissions to be prepared by the Management Team.
The proposals of the City Government are based on the budget preparation of the delegation at the Economic Seminar in Fram on 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the parliamentary process to the City Board and the City Council.
Tens of Turkish police arrested as suspects - against the government
All 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects, against the government, and local media sources tell us.
Police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to Hurricane Daily News, there were 14 senior police officers.
Some of the police were involved in last December’s corruption investigations aimed at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a large criminal society and for the monitoring of telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that period) said that police activities were part of the Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen’s activities against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yassenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the expected journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not spent at every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All Ukraine, the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pasuthov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yassenyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn what will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally the children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry said that the twitting tweet was unauthorized.
The Twitter account, confirmed by Governor Rick Perry of Texas, was sent on Sunday night by a reflective picture of the Democratic District Attorney in the midst of this hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed and followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
“I do not accept tweet and I have removed it,” the later publication said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet included a reflective pictorial picture of the Kravis district lawyer Rosemary Lehmberg, convicted of a rat drink in April 2013.
Perry blocked the financing of Lehmberg when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was: \"I don't always drive drunk, three times allowed with higher promille amounts... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing on his finger.
I'm Texas's drunkest democracy.
The Lehmberg Agency did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor at San Antiiono who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he was innocent and called the accusations political.
His powerful legal assistants have asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on the basis of which the governor who was the worst in Texas was accused is unclear.
Perry cut $7.5 million for state aid to the state's public non-inferior unit, operating in the Kravis County and treating public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision was taken by the left-wing follow-up team to make an official complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
Having reached the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting in 2012, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter on a flying lake, coming from South Carolina.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is re-normal.
One of London’s most important architects has warned that the housing market in Southeast England has returned to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London’s apartments have been plagued by enormous demand and sharp price rises while being afraid of widespread spread of credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
The founder of the high-level architect Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley said on Monday that, from the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normals after the 2013 peak, and added that this has enabled the \"successful operating environment\".
During a very recession in the housing market in London, foreign investors went to the capital in their efforts.
According to the land register data, the prices of apartments in the city rose by 18.5% only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
The average selling prices of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings rose in about one fifth of the previous year, reaching a price increase of 423 000 by the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London’s properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interesting features of the new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric have also been affected by the possibility of a “cartane tax” – before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending orders, would lead to a lower market growth level both in terms of the sales volumes and prices of properties in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s recent data showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cool housing market.
Real estate broker Hamptons International has calculated the 2015 forecast for London’s real estate prices. According to this, prices fall by three per cent because the index measuring the prices of residential owners has already started to decline.
The number of shops made in London in the most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have fallen to the fourth year ago, the real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, domestic demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which raised revenue from the property sold to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Mr Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, correct product in the best places has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained vibrant.
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost one third more than the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The profits calculated before taxes rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus making it £380 million and revenue increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s Annual Meeting that Berkeley’s annual earnings correspond to the current expectations of the market.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley’s stock sold at a flat price at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos on the network
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other star pictures leaked Oscar's actress Jennifer Lawrence's video on the net.
He confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned by the hacker’s “flood” in violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who publish Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be charged with charges.
The pictures originally released on 4chan's photo release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands because of the weakness of the Apple iCloud recording system. The other star of the hundred hacking is said to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashia, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFed said.
It is not known how much of the images are real, yet Scott Pilgrim against World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
“For those who look at me and my husband in private years ago: I hope you have a good mind, Winstead tweet.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon-iCarly- and-Victorious-series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that “seeds of the so-called naked images of me are a matter of concern, do you not understand,
Let me finish this right away.
BuzzFedin announced on Sunday that a pop star, a representative of Ariana Grande, denied the authenticity of the images on the stars.
Only the new novel that we have received the thanks of Howard Jacobson, which tells us about love and j-book
They slipped, it shot the best thing that happened, they gradually got rid of each other than the cardboard box that was left out of the rain.
Only occasionally, he heard from the woman that he was too serious, indiscriminate, intense, disengaged, and perhaps a little tiny too.
That's when he threw his hand.
He recognized the little one.
Yeah, he was a little syllable, like a syllable.
His last victim had been in the early stages of a relationship that had been promising; he had shown that this relationship could have eased his loneliness, and it might have brought his life up to some content.
Ailin Solomon had unspoken hair, and he was a delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, a north village, even more cursing and far away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with his older travel partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was suitable for the Paradise Valley.
There was no one living in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanols had left their tracks on the windows, keeping their whole place in the garden, growing rich grasses, which resembled giant cabbages.
The cabin was like the rain of children, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Written by Howard Jacobson, whose novel-J- is conditional on the Booker Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat in his hand with Ailin with a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to a scattered reception through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news when the Ailinn's crucifixed, the sun's brown feet brought to Kevern's mind a song that had long since been sung by a black performer, and which his father had often listened to in the cottage to in the bottom.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were originally too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually forbidden – they were no longer called.
They wanted to forget, as did the word of their own.
The general opinion led to what was not achieved by the laws and the proclamations: just as in the sacrament of literature, people chose to read heroes' memories, cookbooks and romances, for music, they favour whales.
Kevern began to play the imaginary piano with the key of the day and sings a ceremony for the great nobles of Ailin with a loud-sleeved collection.
Ailin didn't understand.
“It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, while raising two fingers in his mouth.
I always saw his father doing it before he had to run away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father while he was little.
His father said he was playing the same game with his father.
If you let a word start with your mouth, and you didn’t remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for the penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailin had never heard of anything like that.
Jazz was not actually declared a ban, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only one word in life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way.
Its unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard from Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's side CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Alilin that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or sanctions.
The famous society meant that each of its parts was accepted with gratitude – thankfully, for being saved by the trade of happiness – the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical qualities, the families of African-Caribians are best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from India’s continent, they were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that every family had a functional phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the ferry.
When SE, when JOS TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI, was true, they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled victually in the fear of being accused of burning flames, and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened the restaurants in which the labneh River was served, and burned the water pipe, and continued their life views on the ground as created and bored.
Everyone works according to their gifts.
Ailin had only heard Ballades, and it was hard for him to understand how the words he had just sung by Kevern could never be dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for the bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage plants.
But the deal didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers for his lips with Ailin.
I thought he was weird now.
“It was interesting,” he said.
Ailin threw his head infidelity, and his hair covered Kevern's field of view.
Nothing else to see in the whole world than the huge, varnished hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you say so,” he said, “but he didn’t sound convinced.
But that doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
Ailin seemed to be truly confused.
Are my feet so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you, but it was still too early for it.
“You’re charming because of your thick ankles,” he said.
I'm out of my mind.
This wasn't helpful.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to make fun of it, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, was lacking in the convincing charm that could control the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father meant being cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his favorite eyes.
Alin’s Solomons redwashed and rose from his terrace chair, and at the same time poured the receiver and choked the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the backpack, so he couldn’t use it as a cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking like palm tree leaves in the storm.
“And your fat head is what I’ve been passionately attracted to you,” he said.
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Alinn, both for his own unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailin decided to resist him.
Did Ailin think he'd hit him?
He had never told Kevern about his life in a huddle north of the archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was certain that it was essentially the same as life here.
The same huge, hypnotic sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though after TAPAHTUNE, are even more pale and pillier than their secret driver and shattering parents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who dared to resist or torture them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat dick if he wasn't careful.
First of all, the most common word about the erotic encounter of a man and a woman had come from a kiss; then the antidote to the unimportant loveballads of the receiver out of the pylons, first, and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, because it was hostile in itself.
Alin's Solomons body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him, just as his travel companions looked at Kevern’s going from the window above, a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Adam is leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
A man who had lost all the fight – why did he feel so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, intelligent and eager 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the general mind in Offow, made a brief study of the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the areas in which violence was reduced, or, in any case, the end, was likely to take into account the money and energy used for its struggle.
“A lot has already been accomplished, and much has not yet been done,” he wrote, “which can be offset for thousands of years by the natural aggressiveness of the people who won most of the time, especially in the abandoned and remote hills, where, in spite of the cross-sections of the bushes, human leprosy is rarely known at the time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the mood it produces.
The people cry for the sentimental balades, embroidery of the anointed contrast stories, and swear on the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps indiscriminate in their taking both rural communities and urban cohabitation areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more malicious dispute in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
“You have to complain about the tendency to dramatize,” he said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum fell into sight of the earth.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
“I don’t have to answer that,” Esme Nusbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again silence.
“I don’t ask,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I’m against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of unprecedented society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectful, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, to what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or evilness, others generally call natural energy and physical strength.
As if it had happened yesterday, if it happened, it would destroy the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while talking about Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the Flamingovalean red LED light announced the instructions that Offow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the balls, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, do not agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and the sang word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
“I understand very well what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum responded with a silent voice, when he was certain that his director had stopped, “and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we will repeat the same mistakes that originally led to SIIHEN, WHAT WAS THE TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI.
This time, however, we do not shed our hatred and distrust with others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his finger.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you’re describing the actions that our grandparents might have done or not to do.
You will also go too far when you say that they poured out their \"badness and distrust with others.\"
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not speak of 'we' or 'they'.
There was no \"we\" or \"other\".
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
“If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos, Esme dared to continue,” no group of society can say well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or bad.
Then there was.
We don’t have to talk about it any more – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to give up accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is any way to do them.
But for what purpose the past exists if it is not learned...
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add another thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I’m going through your report,” he said and said, “It was time to go.
The next day, when he came to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the footwalk, whose driving the passers described as “past and rageful.”
There's a coincidence.
Lesotho's army is denying its plans to strike; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied the attack on the government and said they were acting against the police, suspected of trying to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maserus.
The head of the state traveled with his family to the neighboring country after he told South Africa that he had suffered a death threat.
Major Ntle Ntoi of the Army said that the army was so responsible for the threat that came from “political fanatics,” the police said, trying to armed fanatics.
“Lesotho’s defense forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence data that certain police forces were trying to armed young party fans when they were ready to cause problems,” he told Voice of America’s news agency.
According to President Clayson Monylan of the South African Government, military action seemed to be a revolutionary undertaking.
“Even though no government has claimed to have reversed the government by means of force, the actions of the Military Forces of Lesotho appear to be in all respects the signs of a revolutionary company,” he said.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their chambers on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has expressed tensions since June, when Thabane suspended the session of the Parliament because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the government's power, even though it is otherwise claimed.
Shop: Microsoft to set up a data center for New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center for the Uusimaa, the location of which the company refuses to specify.
In a press release sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the centre had previously been taken to Oulu or Kajania.
Microsoft completely ceases its office in Oulu, which takes a job from about 500 people.
Overall, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
The Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The establishment of the Data Centre for New Zealand was announced on Monday by the Trade magazine.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under the water, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most favorable option is a waterproof compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these photos at a family party, using a number of different cameras, each of which paid less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be followed.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video you take.
In some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera, there is a setting to optimize the description conditions under the water.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure that your device can take you deep.
Some cameras last only 5 feet depth, others up to 50-60 feet depth.
Explore both our regular and waterproof models in our shopping guide and in the review of digital cameras.
Take a number of pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to smooth the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it’s hard to see under the water, and the harmony of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera allows additional gripping, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, make use of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced by deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you describe the pool, lake or sea.
This way you can also get more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the item you're describing.
This is important advice when describing the country, but even more important under the water, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image angle, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire image frames along with.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the lack of peace requiring democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protesters of Hong Kong’s business block to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress in practice gives Communists the power to curse all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still disgusting,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with the autonomous regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee on the Congress of the People's Republic of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that a general candidate for the election of the Hong Kong leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the UK surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents to choose their own leader since 2017.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong could vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee to be administered from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong are accepted.
During the summer before the decision, some of the biggest protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely behind the Octupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to prevent the business world’s block operation if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right of vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong headquarters.
In the demonstration, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and they would create protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not tell the details, apparently, with the fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published on the website, the organisers said that the movement-to-business of the Occupy Central is the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way.
We are very sorry to announce that today’s last opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the capture of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been prepared to report to Beijing for days, and on Sunday security activities were tightly close to government headquarters, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, many people feel that residents are quietly losing their power in their city.
The wave from Mantera has brought competition on products and services.
In addition, the fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its mental expressions threaten Hong Kong’s living condition – a business world.
“The protest they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” says Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong to get away from us.
Such an idea would be bad for investing.
The media of the Chinese state also shows stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the hands of the Western powers that are in the revolution.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the biggest demonstrations supporting democracy in the region.
U.S. Prom tradition hits UK universities: new students with private jets
We are looking forward to the demand by setting up the first class of British luxury travel for today’s students.
In addition to private aircraft, the company also offers other transport advice, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the University.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who, by the way, scratch their property across the country in car loading.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet come because the service has just been set up, but added that “students will start making orders over the next few weeks.”
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 pounds per academic year.
Today’s students have very different expectations and expectations from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago started their studies. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice-President of the University Department of Applied Sciences, Megan Dunn, this service plan seems to be a very far away from the student majority’s life.
Many of their studies start to shock the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained behind the sharp rise in basic living costs. Only next can we begin to think about where thousands of people could be found to be used for both simple and campus arrivals.

Bulgarian prison staff hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria showed their mind in front of the Ministry of Justice of Sofia.
In peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return to the old working rules that were recently amended.
There is also a need to discuss wage increases with the temporary Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours, saying that they want to return to the old 24 hours of employment system.
Despite the meeting of representatives of the Prisoners Organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgaria’s national radio (BRR) said.
The negotiations are currently being held, and Rosen Zhözkov, Director of the Directorate-General for Enforcement of Judgments, told PNR.
The protest of the prison workers’ organisation is also expected to be linked to members of the trade union of workers from the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fans' promotion almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Koriball Sasu Salin was today a corporalization of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget the depth of his U.S. match and browsed the blood of the other half of Ukraine with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the wolves and did it in style:
I went out there at the end of the field, and the temptation was so great.
In the eyes, but in my eyes, there was nothing.
It was almost too much for me and the white audience.
The power moments of Salin kept nine surfaces in a fast pace, balloons, discs and temmelin in every place that happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got a flash mode like that that, and it all worked out.
They come from some point of view, now it's an intellectually important place, Sasu said.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see the others get caught.
It was infected with the whole gang.
Salin is a team's joy pillar and breathtaking, so it's no wonder that his example brought the whole team to the flight, which was too much for the big and hard-core Ukrainian five.
In the Finnish World Cup after 32 years of pause, I remembered a serious judge game.
Heikki Montonen, who carries the casino, was the head coach of Finland at the Argentina World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish football team played for the last time in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember the tournament for one thing like last day: it was in the early block a hot match against France.
“In this match, the court game was dirty,” Kosonen said.
We had already won, and both teams had already placed on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost 2-3, and then the statues were more confused, said Parkkali.
Finland played the lead coach in Heikki Montonen's command and eventually settled on 17th.
Now Finland is among the world's lights again, when the Polish World Cup is on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in the international aviation world over the course of 32 years.
The players’ power values are about the same category as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster, thinking about Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player’s material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to get further from the first block.
Then you can get tight, Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Joko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a battle against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to cheat on the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to the lawn,” said Parkkali.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was the second country team coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savi, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were running in Tunisia.
The sauna and evening battle in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's World Cup in 1982.
Kari Kalin (i.e.) stretched with his teammates.
The finals of the Young Star Song Contest won't win South Karelia

The song teacher Teja Immose said that competition has been popular.
That's a good experience.
The finalists still record the competition songs.
There are always great memories at the moment of competition, Immonen says.
The Finnish courts saved the Cita Dog from the mountains in Norway: “These men deserve all praise.
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were forced to go to the bay on Thursday, Antti and Tuumo Soini offered to help.
The weekend is Mikkelsen’s search for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his assistants once more.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that the Cata dog, who was in the mountains on Thursday, was injured.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it be.
I tried several times to attract and pull it a little forward, but its legs didn’t just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help was made out of the police, a nearby hotel, and no passovers.
In the dark of the evening, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two wanderers who were willing to help: Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at the Galdhøpiggen and directed their camp as they saw the slopes of a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells me in his message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was a German man who had a hiker with him.
There were a couple of cases from Patja to Cita, where the injured dog was attached.
The German man came here for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog off the slopes for a moment, Soini said.
KUVA: Tuamo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a pilot.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in a difficult terrain.
After about a half hour, Cita was happy to get down.
After the encounter, Mikkelsen was still looking for international heroes on Facebook to thank them once more.
They answered him on Sunday, but the German man is obviously still untapped.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people, because I don't feel like I thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and glory, I am eternally grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Sorns were already on their way home.
They were happy to hear from Mikkelsen: \"Cita says it's better!

Genetic deviations are often diagnosed incorrectly
For years, the British woman feared death because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years of life left because he was diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK approval organization, a false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known so little.
According to estimates, around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motor illness, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and body pain.
The disease can also cause inability or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and would die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the mother of the 51-year-old two children says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as others.
I fell asleep every day and took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from everyone else.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was performed several oscillators to complete his feet. In the course of the surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from a FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I went home and got accurate information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association,” he said.
When I learned from them, I was shocked and in panic.
I thought I was going to a wheelchair by the age of 18 and I'd die before I was 25, and in between, I'd lose my entire ability to act quietly.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just kissed me and said, \"girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you're already in wheelchairs.
I think you're suffering a lot less from a dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
“When I was explained what CMT disease was, I thought I was delayed,” he said.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
One hundred migrants found in a coal truck in Macedonia
The authorities of Macedonia have found more than 100 illegal migrants on a train carried by coal, the Ministry of the Interior of the country said Monday.
Most of them were Syrians and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found on Sunday from Veles to Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” said Ivo Koteiski, the Minister of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid around 3 000 euros each to get to Greece, and another EUR 800-900 more to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants go through a few million citizens in Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
There have already been three million people running from Syria's bloody civil war.

Most sales grew in small stores and large supermarkets.
During the first year of January-July, the turnover of goods and hypermarkets has decreased by more than two per cent.
The sales of daily goods, however, have increased by almost a per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluodon's triple reactor is completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule to the Industry Force TVO.

Nastola donated to Bottaks 1.4 hectares of beach plot - value of about 60000 euros
The Nustola municipal government donated a formula to Valtter Bottaks, 1.4 hectares of beach to the Kärkjärvi beach.
The municipal administration showed a fair sport mind and was unanimous in its decision.
The sora voice was not part of the meeting when the plot was decided, says Pauli Syraki.
The bottteks' gift plot has the buildings of the farm - seven pieces.
The municipality will break them down this year, with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a free-time apartment within two years.
We are aware that he has enjoyed his birth control and wants to be here in the future.
Valtter has been going to the sub-levels every year to tell about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully it will continue, the municipal leader says.
The manager considers the beach plot to be a monetary value of EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is low and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for ten years.
Nastola has, over the decades, been holding successes in sports with the help of successful talent plots in the municipality.
Aki Parviainen and aerobick World Champion Tuuli Matitsalo received their own homes and built their own homes.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came after the work of Nastola and then changed their life situation elsewhere.
Bottos is a native Nazian, and his situation is different, Syria's core, and believes Bottsa's permanent home.
Hull washed the attacker with Hernandez's club record
Hull was a member of the group for the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, the National Team of Uruguay.
Hernandez exchanges the Hull Italian Seura from Palermo with a £9.5 million, i.e. about €12 million.
The agreement is three years old.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the Italian main series.
At the Uruguay National Team, he has made seven goals in 14 matches.
In the last summer’s World Cup, Hernandez came to the field in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we've reached in a short time, said Hull's chief coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he also acquired the Senegaln National Team Captain Mohamed Diamen West Hama.
Russian space experiment failed - the genes sent to sex travel died
Five little genomes sent to Russian space are dead, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's space organization.
The gekos travelled to the Foto-M4 satellite for more than a half month.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning at the time of Finland.
The purpose of the experiment was to explore the reproductive capacity and use of the genes in an unimportant state.
One male and four females participated in the test.
Although the test sounds like a different kind of experiment, its purpose was serious.
For example, the effects of intrusion on the development of gene eggs are only known a little.
The effects of the genes can be expected to have an effect on human weightlessness in the longer-lasting state of this state, as illustrated in July by New Statesman.
Roscosmus says the time of death and the cause or cause of death are determined.
According to Interfax News Office, “sexs” were frozen by crucifixed passengers.
Surprisingness also indicates that the fruits of the same Foto-M4 ride survived the resuscitation, and also received a post-growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested the suspect man at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruiter of the jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed it on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track the man after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alarmed the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was totally ignorant of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalized young people attracted to Iraq or Syria also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or French writers have traveled to Syria, returned from there or are currently planning their departure to Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning.
The wishes of the basketball team are in the game when Finland meets today in the second match of the World Cup.
If the opening phase for the United States was expected, Ukraine will be part of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have good chances of winning, Petter Copenhagen predicts.
Ukraine was hit on Saturday in its first match in Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, in command of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene-Pooh-Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a world champion of hundreds of meters behind three years.
On the Dominican Republic, Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but we are played against such things before and we have to get our standard defense fixed,\" Kopenen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than yesterday’s defeat to the United States.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee you that the field will see a normal sushi, Möttölä said.
The alleged attacks of Hollywood stars spread online - part of the verified real
On the Internet, there are a number of naked images that claim to present well-known audiences.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of a \"acupuncture campaign\".
The website TMZ has published an angry comment issued by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross breach of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence (Internet) will be charged with prosecution, representatives will be threatened.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures that spread him are genuine.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed long ago, I can only imagine what a rough trouble was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who were victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice says images of his own name are counterfeited.
True or fake naked images are also on the move at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solot, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticises her own: “They don’t work enough to get out of here.
The football club FC Honka is currently in the last place in Veikkausliga.
After the Sunday VPS match, Maralivahti Walter Viittala’s comments describe a very confused current situation.
I haven't had a goal coach for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted, five said after the battle ended in 1-2.
Honka made a lot of mistakes in the game, especially during the first half of the game.
He was not a bad defense player in his mind.
The gamer traffic in Honga has been live this summer, and for this reason, the defenders in front of Vitala have changed at a time.
Many young players have also received opportunities that they may not even earn.
“It doesn’t work enough to get you out of here sometimes,” the five of us didn’t call any single players.
Honga’s chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viita.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you’re a vegan player, and you don’t have to work, you must be in the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given many young people playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the possibility, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also pointed out that players can’t expect immediate success when players constantly change.
This period has not been twice in a row with the same composition.
In particular, the crew has changed.
That's the biggest reason we're in this place, Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after a VPS hit, and the second one at a level with the last TPS.
There are seven more spins left, so the Espolians still have time to avoid falling to Ykkö.
I've never done a team before, and I'm not going to do it now.
We're not going to fall out of this series.
Lars von Trier after decades of pause on TV
The film director Lars von Trier is going to return to the TV series.

Ice Bucket from the participants to their jaws
Britt Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when he was poured in ice-cold water that he damaged his face's bone.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended badly.
A woman has been taken to treat her screaming for Ice Bucket when she does so hard that her jaw went from her pigs.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when he was poured on ice cold water that he damaged the structure of his face.
“The water was so cold that I just screamed, but when I screamed, I felt that my jaw began to be rigid,” he told The Mirror magazine.
Ice water is poured on 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts a moment before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to say thank you for the first aid.
A 20-year-old British hospital was taken to a super-sounding challenge on Tuesday, where the jaw was restored.
The video has become an Internet installation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Vision of the wolves (also): How can you explain the growth of the fan?
Today was a great file.
This is what the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played an EM final tournament against France at the Athenian Marouss Balloon Hall.
He didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when you were there.
There were also about 100 Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers, otherwise I ruled the noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland?
In Bilbao, there are hundreds of Finnish fans eighty times.
The European Championship in 1995 was the search time for Finnish basketball.
The men cut their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, Russia’s race at the Helsinki Sports House.
It would open the doors to the European cream.
It all looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttöll.
Henrik Dettmann, the head coach, raised Möttölä's cup line to the final tournament team.
The solution that many disagreed on.
Now, you can say that Dettmann was far-reaching wise, even though not all went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens competitions, Finns were in total more than a hundred.
It included journalists, players’ relatives, Finnish basketball trainers and some fans.
There are journalists, relatives and trainers in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has increased to the unexplained proportions.
No one can say a precise number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
There was a number of things between that, it's an imaginable number.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, companies cross borders.
Sport still has the opportunity to look at how we are going internationally.
As we increase mobility, we can see how our girls and our sons succeed in the world, says Hannu Ikonen, a professor of mobility levelology.
Surely, both in Spain and in the World Cup in Poland, there are Finns who are looking for life.
A common experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself must be a attraction.
Ikonen raises sport as part of popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports games than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, however, the masses will not be launched.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, chief coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and also played players to throw into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then they moved and the national team was raised to the ground.
The air balloons did the same thing a little earlier.
Both enjoy the fruits of work.
As Ikonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The audience is also interested in it.
And the media has taught me what this kind of carnival support is, Ikonen reminds me.
Can the ball species also move this massive interest into the home series?
On average, basketball plays for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
The point is to keep the question good, and it is not necessarily to give an answer that would promise very good species.
The second school believes the interest will move.
The other is the one who doesn't want to make the stomach full.
This group is ready for a trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of two interest.
There is a challenge for the followers in the midst of the drug.
Bottaksan tontoll - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola is rewarded by a formula driver at Valtter Bottaks' beach house.
The municipal government unanimously approved the donation of 1.4 hectares of land on Monday.
It will be a free-time apartment in the future.
The success of Bottsa has been monitored in Nastola until this time of carding.
He is experienced as a good ambassador to the market of Lahti, Lahti, and Nestola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become a part of the Nastola Municipality as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area, from which the municipality will disassemble six out by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved his fourth prize winner in the Belgian competition in Formula One this year.
He's at the World Cup. He's fifth.
Bottas is a native Nazi and has lived on the basis of its childhood.
He lives in England today, but visits Nastola whenever he is free from formal forms.
Bottos has visited high school and youth facilities.
Design intelligence is coming, but hardly for the poor.
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the field's ballmen, but also an amateur named at the top of the university players, Marcus Giron likes that.
He said the shirt will help him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt has been woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the muffle in the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure the heart rate, the rhythm of breathing, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the central unit will be disconnected.
The fashion house hasn't told you the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor did you even suggest it at the price, the Tech Times said.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothes.
California's Athos has sold smart shirts and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothings cost $100 per piece and their required thumb size center unit costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about tech clothing.
A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of higher education in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so the Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, soon found a smart way to save the cost.
He developed a system where students of later annual courses lend their books to nominal compensation rather than selling books forward the same way.
“My book of mathematics would normally cost $180; I paid $10 for it throughout the academic period, and I supported the sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his book for the last semester would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University’s Executive Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have many means to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly determined to use online shops and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company holding over 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics in the field reveal that about one quarter of the books in the bookshops of universities were rent books,” said Trevor Meyer, Chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired in the bookstores of campuses.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online Stores
In online stores, you can only get a third of the price it would pay for in the bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s 9th edition of the Calculus book is almost $290, but the book from the online store Chegg.com receives $239.99.
Buy used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and the worn appearance.
For example, “Calculus” book can be used for Chegg.com online store with $93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last-year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says that he bought a book “Strategic Media Skills: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business – used for Amazon.com online store only $0.42.
The new book would have paid $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst's College Without Walls, recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous weights in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new emphasis are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old weight can only be found with a fraction of the price that should cost a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rentals
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to restore them and do not need them when you complete the course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use and wear of the lifting threshold for the following payments.
If you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the book’s purchase price.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented when the right to use the e-book is paid to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg will receive the “Calculus” book as an e-book for six months with about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most, because many classics today can be charged for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different sellers is worth the choice.
Joe Gautt, 29 who will soon begin with Pepperdic in legal science, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it allows you to make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order a network, make sure the book is stored, Gault says.
He learns through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was in the ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to buy a book at a full price in the university’s bookstore.
Tampere Legion Theatre
The theatre established in 1994 opposes unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
All those who want to do the performing art are welcome to the action.
Organize expression-weight recreational activities for long-term unemployed aged 17-35.
The presentations often take place in society.
In recent years, there have been depression-related depression Moderata, memmin! - humorist reports of narcissism and classics.
He believes that every person can change his own life.
Almost twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year.
This year, almost twice the number of people have died compared to last year.
According to the Central Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek) media monitoring, 55 people have already died in fires in 49 different fires.
Last year, the fire was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
More than 65 years of age have been 11.
According to the organization's fire mortality statistics, the worst situation was last year in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in the apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths, 21 in private homes, and seven in row houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the need to repeat the fire safety of the home.
At least the performance of all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Speck.
In addition, everyone should be able to check that the initial cutting tools are easy to use.
All the premises of the home must also be an accessible exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city centre of Newport on a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall at a meeting.
Stephen Firclough followed the events on the weekend and spoke with protestors who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
KAKSI’s teen-age patenter was raised in security after they were stuck in the night in the blue mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old man went on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackhead.
They were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police from midnight.
A search party composed of local policemen and assistants was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found around 23 o’clock near Bridal Veil.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were brought to security on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukraine's forces have withdrew from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the troops were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the billing forces have gone along with Russian tanks on the field.
According to the army's representative, the other side of the gun has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professionals.
In the past day, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Sea of the Southeast Ukraine, the Ukrainian coastal ship, which was caught up in the morning, said the border guard.
Eight sea soldiers have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no certainty about where the ship was shot.
The Separatists told me that they were shooting in social media yesterday.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukraine's troops should immediately withdraw to stations that they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should lead to an immediate ceasefire without any conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will have to respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Malmö and Copenhagen flooded
The streets were flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the heavy rains struck South Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood can last, even if the rains were predicted to cease on Monday.
The heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities, and the rain was not provided in advance by weather guards.
The current meteorologist Ari Mustala of Finland’s Finnish Finnish Department of Climate Sciences estimates that the rainforest affected by the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and still.
No wonder it has been difficult to predict.
The French Socialists should “be quiet and help France,” Francois Hollande’s main supporters say.
Valls strongly called for the division of left-wing, to show his feelings, to the socialist president with difficulties, whose composition of the new government did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our mission is to stay with him,” Valls said, and earned the installments.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister asked the Government to leave the French controversial 35-hour working week in spite of the proposal made earlier by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron, which raised the debate, that the rule should be foolishd.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused the Eusat by appearing at the meeting of socialist representatives who expressed differing opinions and by criticizing the Socialist Party that it allowed the \"Ranska to give up hope for the future\".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Supreme National Front, mocked the persistent esatism of the Socialists and said that the new government of Valls did not believe it would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
“The new government will not last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen said to reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to break up the Parliament and kept his party's electoral victory in the early elections and he would himself be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crush on the March municipals and the extremist court held a list of cuts in the EU elections in May.
According to an opinion poll from the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
The political researcher at the University of Po Pascal Perrineau warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government managed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pokka betrayed Finland’s runners Kirsi Alm-Sieran, Nina Rahkkola, and the meteorologist Pekka Pouda’s cheek was heavily betrayed in the taped section of the program.
On Thursday, the Finnish programme published a funny video of the recordings on Thursday.
On video, runners Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the Finnish advertising buffer for the next day, but the recording is not going to go quite well.
Alm-Sir is confused with what he says when he tries to say the word budget dispute, and his confusion also makes Poudan and Rahkola lose his cheeks once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to carry out a direct broadcast tomorrow, according to the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both loved and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Poutu, 68, was ranked third in the series of potrets in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
The meeting of the Socialist International Assembly was held at Fredrikkadu Helsinki in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State and security were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had a lot of five minutes to describe.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and the background were right.
I realized that this time I did it.
From the perspective of the Meir, the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
In that case, you will be able to compete with known persons or images taken from events.
It is great that you can also succeed in other images today, as long as you have an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the Lasse Virén’s crash picture of Munich’s Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Claim: Aarnio’s investigation has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department of Drugs has already paid more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyrimäki evaluates the University of Jyväskylä in thesis on IT.
Rajamäki suggests that the supervision of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could, at all, be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial processing.
According to the border, modern technology enables multiple use of criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically evidence of the electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and, at the same time, enables comprehensive legal supervision.
The complaint will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food forgot to the wall of the school:
The picture of the special information on the wall of the Pyrikastician Women's Travel School caused a meal in social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken food included in the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian choice!
This is said to be on the school wall in a forgotten, 15-year-old press release.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread in social media has led people to send a hearty feedback to Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, says Yle, that the box that was forgotten on the wall is not correct and it should have been removed from time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there have been such an idea that has been discussed with healthcare in the past.
Every student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, at the Schools of Pirkkala, a vegetarian option is offered only with the permission of parents and with the testimony of a doctor or nurse from a vegetarian diet.
The scratch is based on the solution to Yle because young vegetarians may leave the food shortages behind and the absence of meat or chicken can create a wonder from the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise near a $3 billion Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, the third largest cruise company in the world, is going to negotiate to buy its competitors at three billion dollars in Prestige Cruises International Inc.
With the trade, Norwegian Cruise, which has a market value of $6.8 billion, would be introduced against Prestige Cruises and wealthy customers while continuing to compete with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may be published already this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises company, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names in public, because negotiations were not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise Company from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates so far from Miami, sails with the O.A. and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The 29 billion dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
Companies compete in order to reach the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises register its first shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 trade, worth $850 million.
Norwegia Cruise was founded in 2000 with the company Genting Bhd (GENT.KL). The latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thayn.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, Genting’s share of the company was 28%, Apollo’s 20%, and the share of the private equity investment company TPG Capital LP was 8% from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies in North America’s cruise capacity is 82%, according to the registration document published in the context of the launch of the Prestige Cruise shares.
The City Board of Tampere will discuss this today.
Animalia wishes the city government to support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivara, the Executive Director of Animalia, a doctoral dissertation for Tampere University, it is necessary to end the dolphins in Finland and around the world promptly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread view of the lack of animal protection and ethical sustainability of advanced mammals such as dolphins.
This view would also be expected to take place in Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinaria is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination.
According to the court, the death of Näsi-delphine is determined by the requirements of the dolphin activity.
I saw death as a sad continuation to the dark history of the Särkanniemi dolphin.
It’s time to put a point on the deaths, close the dolphins’ prison, and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, a kind of conviction threat.
It was not possible to experience the return to the original living environment of the dolphins, but hopefully the remaining dolphins living in Särkanniemi were able to experience more life than their unspoken concrete.
The aim of Animal Protection Association Animalia is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection law under preparation.
There are also dolphins in this group.
In support of the requirement, the Executive Director of Animalia will be involved in today’s 1.9-day demonstration for dolphins.
Japan’s embassy in Helsinki will be held against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or brutally killed annually, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin insists that Kova open negotiations with East Ukraine on the new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the regional state of the country.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory of the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
Putin's request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus forces the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the newly proclaimed Novorossian independence to the newly declared Novorossians, which can help it to focus on Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned Ukraine’s army’s efforts to reinstate the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region ruled by the Separatists, which was occupied by the Separatists in March and April Moscow, after joining Ukraine to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region as the Novorossian, the \"New Russia\" – this term resembles the glorious days before the great revolutions of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks were “fair” as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections held on 26 October, and government forces attack civilians in the areas controlled by separatists.
“We must immediately start a wide-ranging negotiation, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of the south-east Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of the people living there,” he said.
According to Peskovi, Putin’s reference to the state of the state is linked to a broader independence which has been discussed with the Kyoto leadership for months in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be compromised.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant Eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There can be no debate between Ukraine and Russia on this issue, says Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine.”
The mid-term communication of the Kremlin representative, designed to correct the misinterpretation of Putin's comments, emphasised that the Russian administration treats the separatists of the eastern regions in a different way than that of Crimea, in practice, the area in which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link itself to the territories of Donetsk or Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to the pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree themselves on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically within the territory of the power which connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian main fleet and in the port areas of commercial shipping and historical coastal destinations.
There are also mines, factories and metal sinks in the area between Russia Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, proposed that Ukrainian legislators, after a new election, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions that differ from the core region of Ukraine, on their own economy and on the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists of the armed and flames of Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his most recent claim to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels went further in the last week after Russian tanks and troops entered East Ukraine from a peaceful area on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
Ukraine’s security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk, the separatists supported by Russia, is the beginning of a greater effort aimed at taking over the entire strategically significant coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilians and military personnel to carry out the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, a half million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between the narrow land area leading to Novoazovsk and the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for further measures to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon arrive at a point where there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not make any decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional sanctions to enable them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine resembling under unclear circumstances.
Ukraine’s soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the region of Ilovakis after the transfer of two Russian armor divisions and 1,000 troops to Donetsk last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers from the Russian invasion in Ilovaki were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the Ukraine area a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by Japanese writer Kesuike Honda on the seventh game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later hit Jeremy Menez.
Laziok received a crucifix at the end of the game, but the goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attacker icon at Inzagh's coaching debyy San Siron Stadium was only half.
39 000 viewers were announced for the competition.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been stolen from hackers by his betrothed and the Hollywood A-list Gabi Greckon naked photos.
In the entertainment world, a bunch of Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos were released on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging poster hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked images of the Hunger Game Star Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Deleving, singer Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actor Kirsten Dunst.
The photos of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsk, and Greckon in Melbourne have also been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list has 101 celebrities.
Edelsten said to the Confidential magazine last month, \"This is disgusting.\"
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and distributed.
The Greckon in New York reports with comments about the case on the web page “sacrifice,” and said the victims felt embarrassed.
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with Scott Speedman of the previous boyfriend, including two extracts from Palmer at the top of the square.
Palmer’s film shows include Love and Honor – the opponent Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of Chuck's series Strahovski and the Sucker Punch actress Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
Mr Lawrence’s representative told the TMZ magazine that “there is a serious breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen was angry with the hacker in his tweet: “The release of images stolen from the Internet does not differ from the sale of the stolen product in any way.
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost as on its home street and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of a fanhuuma.
The Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red white, but Finnish blue white.
Finland’s victory was followed by almost 2,000 Finnish people in the Spodek area, according to the STTT.
It felt like playing at home.
That's the big effect that fans had on our game, Captain Antti Siltala of Finland said to STT.
Finland had already lost almost 0-2, but won a lot of 3-2.
In the fourth batch, Finland made a miracle rise after six points.
Cuba has already led a 16-10, but after that, the Finns have been charmed.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when a charter machine could not land due to the hard fog of Katowicee.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe with a hard pace in the last few days.
In the Spanish Bilbao basketball World Cup, Finland’s fans are over 8,000.
As if every Finnish basket had been a winning age, American star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish chores after Saturday's match.
