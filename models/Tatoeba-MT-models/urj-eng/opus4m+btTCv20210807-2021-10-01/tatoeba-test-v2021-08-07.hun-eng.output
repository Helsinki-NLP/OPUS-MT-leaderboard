I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should've expected that.

I'm sleeping with two pillows.
After midnight, I slept an hour ago last night.
I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I've been with my boss.

Cigarettes.
Is Monday going to be good?
Am I clear?
I clicked a picture.
I got into the house.
I got into the house.
I blew it.
Is it okay now?
Isn't it enough for you to ruin my life?

I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is Paris far away?
I'll talk to the Dutch.

Russia is part of Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is that your mom?
Is it very close to Sicily?
I've been staring at papers all day, and now I'm tired.
I began to doubt the truth of his claim.
I stayed.
Are tea more expensive than milk?
Is he allowed?
Is that all of your little ones?
Secret?
Is that right?
Is that intentional?
Is that being in the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that being in the picture or is it on it?
Is that my douche?
Was this included in a public document?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Do you have a scientific basis for this?
Did you count on that?

Right?
But is that true?

I remember it was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have plenty of time to have fun.
There's one more or two more things to put in the suitcase.

Thomas's still sick?
I was standing with him.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I learn about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're already packed and ready to go.
I must have heard this sound somewhere.
I swear I'll make up for that.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Do you feel better about your daughter?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There is no doubt about it.
That affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take your place.
I go to work on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's all up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You're better off with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work wasted.
He's clearly upset.
He didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
There's no snow left.
He'll let you go.
You're not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I'm teaching Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I found out slowly that I misunderstanded him.
It's been snowing the previous day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
That's exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, honey.
There must have been a reason for this.
Suddenly it happened.
This happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
You have your own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you're having a good time with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think some movies fell out.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill you.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel like I'm better.
I think we have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
It's very small, I think you're going to be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career shift.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you'd better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor could have died.
I think you're having a good time with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's not right.
I find spiders for cute people.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I think, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tomi's excited.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think he wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all stuck now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what the name of Thomas's girlfriend is.
I think you're gonna give it up.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you have a pleasant smell.
I don't think you've been so convincing.
I think you were right.
I thought of Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe it was worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head would blow up.
I thought about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It had a big impact on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical scene.
It's hard to put into practice what it was about.
It's hard for everyone to go to the mood.
It's hard for everyone to enjoy.
I have doubts if it will work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
In essence, it's your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's not too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
This is not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not who Tom has a problem with.
Not so expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
They don't fit in to talk with their mouths full.
It's snowing.
Still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's a too easy task for him.
It's up to you.
This is a useful information.
The heat is high at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after replacing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark before we get home.
He'll be ready when he needs it.
He'll be ready until he has to.
It will take some time to wear glasses.
He'll knock you down soon.
It will work if I replace the polarities.
It seems to be bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need me here.
You need a shave.
Looks like you don't feel good here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
It can save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it out.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
He must have been stolen.
We need to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you, Tomi will love you.
I have a question, too.
I used to bathe for a long time.
I've been in the bathtub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on the 58th road.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It happened yesterday.
It's a lot of rain.
I practice two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I cross-countryed the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to fall asleep.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life, too.
I'll keep trying to inform you.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-ass cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour until lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's seven o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams was always that I was living next to a dam.
It's always the same woman.
Environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame!
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a big weirdo.
It's a nightmare.
It's ice cold.
It's just as art as much as science.
It's already in the past.
She's in school.
It is a very dangerous sport where a small mistake can lead to serious damage.
It's an old book.
It's a waste of money.
It's a strange question.
That's awful.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's raining this day.
Hard day today.
It happened earlier.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to kick the garden at night.
It's a fire.
Yeah.
It's better to get on a bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get a sweater?
It is known that the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep.
That's very delicious.
It's ready!
It's easier not to start than stop.
It's easy to be brave from far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing has changed.
It's very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
It seems to me you're honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Oh, dear.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
Not nearly perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
It's yours.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
He's starting to be a comedian.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
It's great you could come.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It is difficult not to reach that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that all this time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a pad in this town that you can sleep in.
It's hard to put it in words.
It is difficult to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
Very nice.
His head is very big.
High.
The children have a place in bed.
Stop making money.
Tonight it's warmer than usual.
It's illegal.
That's important.
It is important for parents to stand on one side when it comes to raising children.
It's important to help people get into trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You need to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It is impossible to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
It's incredible, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just a move.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's very important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a sub-seat field, and the turtles above him, and the sharks like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's a pity as he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now I'm on the line.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
It's not gonna happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you're doing, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't say anything to you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't make any sense to the priest if you don't testify for a crime.
There's no point in the past.
The snow is coming.
It's obviously broken.
Obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
Obviously very painful.
It's not a problem if some people consider me a farmer.
It's okay if you're gay.
“It’s been three months, and Tomi says he speaks fluently of France. “Well, it’s on the top of the stupid gene.
Just three days.
The park is on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring out of a dog.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's very convincing.
It's probably simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of this mizantrop theories is to reveal in the recruitment of the working class, by excluding imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars that it has led to, and by believing the core of the thought that the causes of the endless wars are the causes of the aggressive tendencies of man.
It's very urgent.
It rains in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big number.
It's over there.
It's a harmless thing to ask someone how much he's looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
Still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
That's got to be answered.
It's time to take our tent tree.
Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I need to cut my hair.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time for us to do something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play the ball.
That's expensive for me.
It's too hot for this.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical autumn time.
It's fucking cold.
It's ugly, cramping yellow, and it doesn't harmonise with anything, but at least they don't get gas in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
Now it depends on them.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Very attractive.
Very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
It's very fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
Very nice of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's where we agreed.
That's your only chance.
It is necessary to learn about 10,000 hours of learning to learn a language.
It must be a bold part of success.

Everyone was unexpectedly understood.
It took an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me over a month to get rid of the cold.
Tom took a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It's been a long time, but it finally managed to find it.
I turned to a little alley.
I've been working on it.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was wrong to do it.
It was a good party.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
This was a tragic accident.
It was a great meal.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was so strange.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
He was a loser.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
He was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, it was a couple of times.
It was just a tear.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy to keep my promise.
That was a hit under the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.
I only knew the real intention when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It happened last night.
It was weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was Sikere.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
The worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom's next.
They kept it completely secret.
He was unsure if he would marry him.
That was urgent.
It will end in a few days.
In a few days, it's all going down.
It will end in a few days.
It takes five or ten years to get the technology ready.
This will grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It's gonna rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
He doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to get out of here.
It would be meaningless.
It would have been better if it were already settled.
It's not courage, it's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
I underestimated Tom.
Okay.
I understand that it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I understand what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't work.
I understand your problem.
I updated my software.
I need a job right away.
I was capable of it, but I didn't.
I used to be married.
I used to drink a lot of chocolate, but now I'm drinking water.
I had a dog.
I lived next to a park.
I used to live next to a park.
