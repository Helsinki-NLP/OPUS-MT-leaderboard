Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid to find themselves in Muppet Show
Some of the members of the National Assembly were enchanted on the proposal that their address would change to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Parliament of Wales).
The line came to be the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) rather than the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, the various political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title will make them an object of laughter.
According to one Labour Party representative, his group is concerned that their new name will be marked with the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\".
Not for the sake of our readers in Wales: in the Welsh language, twp is one-piece, and pwp means cocoa.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the whole group is “unsatisfied” and therefore proposes alternatives.
One conservative representative said that his group “opened” to the name change, however he noted that only one jump from MWP was “Muppet.”
It is worth noting here that in the Welsh language, the letter ‘w’ is similar to ‘u’ in the English of Yorkshire, i.e. MWP, expressed as ‘map’.
The National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law for the amendment of the name is as follows: \"The final decision, of course, is in the hands of the Members of the National Assembly for the titles of the members of the National Assembly.
The 2017 Act governing the Government of Wales allowed the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Parliament of Wales and which received broad support.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission prefers the title of Welsh Parliament Member (member of the Parliament of Wales) and its shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation supported the MWP alternative.
Members are present with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is quite difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on nominal changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including the discretion of representatives and the Commission structures.
In the matter of their own title, Members will be able to give their final vote during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, citizens will vote to change the country’s name to the Republic of Armenia.
The aim of the referendum is to set a point with a neighboring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia, by the end of the decades of debate.
Athens has long said that, with the name of its Northern Neighbor, it has essentially supported the territorial need and has repeatedly challenged its application for EU and NATO admission.
President Gjorge Ivanov Macedón himself opposes the referendum on the name change and thus does not participate in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that must be made for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The harlem temples were silent in a difficult situation, and the bells of St. Martin were silent.
“In fact, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“No one is today.”
As he says, the loss of bars would be understandable.
“People go to society differently these days,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the social living days where people go off every day.”
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the sale of the Church property does not replace the expectations of the leaders, “and in time they will be held back from where they started.”
And in the place of the temples, it will, it will be, housing buildings that are also not helping the fate of the remaining temples.
“The vast majority of those buying apartments in these buildings will be white leather – it says – and it will further accelerate the final closure of the temples, as it is unlikely that the majority of those moving into these apartments would join the community of faith.
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem grew into a black town – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirty-years,
After that, a nearby black congregation was occupied.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black church led by Prince John Howard Johnson – the honorary is known for the use of the blacks on the 125th street or the failure to sell black products against its business owners.
In 1939, a fire was caused by serious damage in the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order the honorable community of Johnson.
Prince David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's parish, proudly called the bells of the poor.
In July, an expert who spoke about the bell game said that this bell game is a cultural heritage, an irreplaceable, historical instrument.
The expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the world's first bell game, which was spoken by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago in the major bell game of the Riverside church.
According to Meriweather, the St. Martin has not signed anyone to his place.
In St. Martin over the past few months, a complicated situation has arisen with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who were partly involved in the secular leadership of the church, partly in the bishop’s office.
In July, the head body of Parókaia, the council of the Church Council, called in writing to the bishop’s office, arguing that the office would “truth the costs” to the council, where the council did not participate in the election of the architects and entrepreneurs that were signed by the Office.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency on the premises of the office.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old California boy while he was sneezing
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy in the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place at the Beacon's Beach Coast at Encinitas in the morning.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego said that Saturday morning with his friends he had been waiting for half an hour when he was aware that a boy was crying for help.
Hammel first thought the boy was excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, \"He bit me!
He was bitten.
“In the key bone, the shoulder was torn apart,” Hammel told him what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I began to wonder if everyone would go out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” he added.
The boy was transported to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The tree of the shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks were detected in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the time and security reasons.
Giles says more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's expansion in the British beauty care market
The Sainsbury's expert would compete with sellers and wholesale-style pipers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the midst of the fall in sales of fashion and household articles, the chain is carried out in 11 stores across the country, and, in case of success, these will appear in new stores from next year.
Strengthening the piper line is due to the fact that the shops try to upload the previously occupied shelf surfaces by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's said it would double down, i.e. increase its supply to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now offering for the first time.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in larger areas on brands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also reboots Boutique’s makeup family, in which most of the products are now in the market – as they are now being sought by more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which is opened in Croydon, the south of London, and the other year in Birmingham Sally Oak.
With the spread of online purchases and the transition of food shopping habits to small local trades, wholesalers need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to mixed trades, as the store chain attempts to compete with discounts like Aldi and Lidl.
Since the two chains were bought two years ago, several hundred stores in Saintsbury’s opened the Argos classes as well as some Habit classes, this step had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition proved even more profitable.
The store chain has failed its previous attempt to repel beauty and medicine classes.
In the early 2000s, Saisbury's became a joint venture with Boots, but the debate on the distribution of the revenue of pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its drug business to Celesio, operating in 281 business three years ago.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a broader palette of luxury skin care products in four shops, with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of the Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hikks said: “By transforming the appearance of our pipers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have also trained staff who provide advice to the interested parties.
Our brand offers all the needs, an attractive environment and a conveniently accessible location that provides a new level of comfort that increases the experience of shopping.
Peter Jones, after Holly Willoughby stopped the 11 million-dollar deal.
The Dragons’ star, Peter Jones, left after Holly Willoughby’s television broadcaster stopped with 11 million important agreements on the way-to-market business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand selling home clothes and accessories.
The two famous companies were previously compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old broadcaster announced on Instagram that he was out.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled the matches out at Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when he left a promising, lifestyle-selling business at the last minute – to focus on his own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones “tombolt,” when his TV salvation on Tuesday, at the headquarters of Jones’ business empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire) announced that, due to his new contracts worth a total of 1.5 million pounds, he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to Truly.
The two famous companies were previously compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and were expected to double their estimated assets for Willoughby’s 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones moved from the island to one of his homes.
According to a source, “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long run, and this will give him his survival in the next few decades.
When he got out, it was a surprise for everyone.
He was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the start.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods for sale.
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars of This Morning, one of Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars from pillows and candles to clothing and home wearing, thanks to possible slips.
And it can also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child director and husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby Capp started Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said this last night: “We don’t want to say about [Jones]’s business affairs.
“We’re in love,” he said.
He was joking about the criticisms he would receive from the press for the statement that some might consider to be “invertible” and for which he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
Trump asked the funny “serols” sound.
I didn't let either of them...
As he noted, Kim would be happy to meet for the second time since the first trial in Singapore in June welcomed Trump as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have been penalized.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, who represents North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as he sees his country, no ‘a suitable response’ will be taken from the United States.
Instead, as stated, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for pressure exercise.
Trump said much more optimistic in a campaign.
“It’s going to be great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost it.
But now the relationship between us is very good.
As he said, efforts to improve the relationship with Kimmel have made positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of U.S. soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in this unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s not hard to act, but now there’s no tens of thousands of people trying to get in on the road, they’re only about two hundred before me,” Trump said.
In Indonesia, hundreds of dead people have a tsunami and earthquake that is turning the island into an island.
Indonesia has also rejected the help of international aid organizations after the earthquake in Lomboki.
Although more than 10% of the population of the Lombards had to be installed, no disaster has been reported at national level, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“In a number of cases, it has been very clearly stated that international aid is not required, so it is a little difficult for us,” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the creation of a Palicoable Emergency Team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Agency, says the Indonesian agencies are currently evaluating the question of whether it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the destructive power of nature.
Although a tsunami was built in Aceh Province, it is not common at all in other coastal areas.
The manifest lack of the tsunami warning system in Palu also contributed to the development of a human life-threatening disaster.
Even in the best time, traffic can be difficult.
During natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombards is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before the disaster hits the affected zone.
President Joko Widodo placed the development of the Copenhagen infrastructure of Indonesia at the heart of his election campaign and did not pay for the costs of road and rail projects.
However, the Joko Government is currently struggling with budgetary deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the president must also face the ongoing tensions in the parties in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had died and tens of thousands had to be settled because of the disruptions, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell in the streets with moulds, bows and arrows, and other heventive weapons.
Video: The huge equation of Daniel Sturrridge in Liverpool against Chelsea
At the Premier League match at the London Stamford Bridge, Daniel Sturrridge saved Liverpool, who did not lose against Chelsea in 89 minutes.
Csapata was at a loss of 0-1 when Sturrridge was given about 30 meters from Chelsea Gate.
He first put the ball on the left and then launched a huge kick in the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high above the sixteenth, and he was heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached the net over the striking Kepa Aririzabalaga.
“I just wanted to get into position because there’s always someone like Shaq who’s going to advance the ball, so I tried to put myself in the best position,” Sturridge said in response to LiverpoolFC.com’s question.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took it off, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led to 1 to 0 in the mid-term after the Belgian starring goal of Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
At the blue battle, Mateo Kovačiči took the ball and then broke it down the middle track and ran into Liverpool Square.
Kovačič started and returned to the ball on the middle track after a quick injection.
After that, he launched Hazard with a beautiful hand to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense and finally sent the ball to the remote corner at the Liverpool gate, along with Alison Becker.
Liverpool is the next station to the League of Champions, with Naples meeting on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo Arena in Naples.
Chelsea plays against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London at the UEFA European League.
832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, reported by the local disaster agency on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 earthquake on Friday, and the 6-metre high fountain waves that follow, more people were buried by the Roma themselves, reported by the spokesperson of the Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of Palu with more than 380 thousand souls are covered by the ruins of the buildings destroyed.
Police murder suspect a 32-year-old man in the case of a stabbed woman
Police launched an investigation in the murder case after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
In the morning, 44-year-old women were found in the Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report anything they saw or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still in the early stages, but this year, I ask everyone who was in Birkenhead around John Street and may have seen or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have anything fixed with the camera on board, to look for us as they may have information relevant to the investigation.
Police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a Iraqi resident and found inside a property.
During the afternoon, women's friends arrived at the site to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is underway and the police are currently reporting the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police got the information that no one could enter the building yet and no one could leave.
When he found out what happened, the man couldn't speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it can take more hours to get into the building again.
One of the police told someone that the whole building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
“That’s terrible,” he said.

Within the order, several police officers watched the block.
Anyone who has any information, write a message to @MerPolCC, call the 101 phone number, or contact the Crimestoppers organization on the 0800 555 111 phone number, and refer to the 247.
The Parliament Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue could perhaps be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and church heritage of England by the followers of Cromwell and the fanatical Puritan.
According to Cromwell Society, however, Crick’s proposal is “boldenity,” a “ experiment to rewriting history”
President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that in the current discussions on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell, before the Westminster Palace, would eventually become a target table.
During the English Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell could be the victim of his ascent in the previous century, Thomas's actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s impressive Cromwell illustration reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and it is a historic area that has to be celebrated by many today.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many of us are considered to be the protector of external pressure, which was of course the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate, it remains a subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certainly certain that this conflict, which was erupted in the middle of the 18th century, had an impact on the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is a identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And as a Lord's protector, it's worth celebrating, and we remember it.
A Chinese farmer killed a dead pig
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
His last name was only covered with blood as a man identified as a Yuan, and he was found in the Kujcousu province along with the pig market in Liupanshui, reported the case on the South China Morning Post Sunday.
It is preparing to inject pigs in a breeding plant on 30 May 2005 in the province of Xining, China, in the province of Csinghai.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jynnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, he found his cousin on the body of a man and discovered that his door to the neighboring pig was open.
He said that the mouth of the giant candle in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found out that the 250-pound pig marta actually died.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and scattered,” said Guiyang Evening News only on his last name as Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked away from harming others while the police were investigating the trails on the site.
Yuan’s family and market authorities report that they are currently discussing compensation for man’s death.
Although it does not occur often, there have been reports of cases before when pigs attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales put a farmer on the tractor until the man's wife failed.
After an oregoni farmer was attacked by his own pigs in 2012, a manitobian farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually prone to attack, but could become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“They’re a lot of players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt me.
“You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Serious rainfalls on Rosa hurricanes in the Southwest region of the United States
The hurricane Rosa is getting weakened according to the forecasts, as the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico are above it.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfalls in the northern part of Mexico and the southern part of the United States in the coming days.
The Rosa took off with 140 km/h windshields, a category 1 hurricane, on Sunday morning at 5 o’clock from Punta Eugen in Mexico, 620 km southwest.
The hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and runs westward toward the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Also-Karifornia on Monday, it is difficult to flood the Southwest areas of the United States as a tropical storm.
The storm can bring up to 25 cm precipitation to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical couple meeting near low pressure masses will cause intense rainfalls in the coming days on the southwest.
Here, the 3-10 cm precipitation can cause sudden floods, debris floods, earthquakes in the desert.
A heavy tropical pair can also produce 5 to 8 cm precipitation per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the Southwest, a precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm is expected, especially in Arizona.
Suddenly, floods may occur, with a rapid decline in strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rainfalls, it is not specifically recommended to walk in the desert.
Because of the severe rainfalls, the canyons can turn into a burning river, and the quakes are suddenly accompanied by windfalls and dust clouds.
The near-air low-pressure masses can cause severe rainfall on the coast of South California.
Up to 1.5 cm precipitation is possible, which can cause smaller floods filled with debris and smooth road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Popular tropical rainfalls can be applied on Sunday night and Monday morning in Arizona, then on Monday day and Tuesday also cover wider areas of rainfall.
A heavy rainfall will spread to the Foursar region on Tuesday, and will last until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as the atmospheric masses cool down, but tropicals remain quite warm.
This can also cause dramatic temperature differences in short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are close to 10 degrees of temperature difference.
In the coming days, it is expected that even more areas will be able to feel the summer warm.
In the Middle and Eastern areas of the United States, it is expected that the time will be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Skiy to some parts of Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the temperature in the eastern parts of the United States will be higher than average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brittany's hearing
On a total of six television channels, over 20 million viewers followed the testimony of Brittany Blasey Ford, a woman seeking the Supreme Court position and a woman accused of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political scene has not been solved, and the broadcasters had to break the normal showflow for the last-minute Friday screw: Jeff Flake's Arizona senator managed to get the FBI to investigate the charges a week.
Ford told the Senate's court case committee that he was 100% sure that at that time, Kavanaugh was captured and tried to get rid of him.
In Kavanaugh’s passionate testimony, he said that it was 100% certain that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated with the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-Spanish and Fox Business Network, were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people who watch shows at work.
For comparison purposes, so many viewers are used to football players or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, from all channels, Fox News Channel, who attracted experts to Kavanaugh's appointment, was the highest viewer with an average of 5.69 million people throughout the day's hearing.
In the second place, the ABC stands with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The interest has not been reduced since the hearing.
The main actor of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of the Moderate Republican Senator issued a statement that Senator Kavanaugh would put down the Voks, the CNN and CBS show on Friday morning was visible as the loud crowd of protestors were received, as soon as he was on a lift to the meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He was standing in the middle of nowhere while the crowd was snooping him, and CNN broadcast the scene lively.
“I’m here before you,” a woman told the senator.
“You really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country’s public.”
Others shouted, “You are in power to do things that are not for so many women.”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement, and then he added, before closing the elevator door, that he would share what he had to say at the hearing of the Commission.
On cable and broadcasting channels, it was seen later in the live hours, as the Committee votes to see if Kavanaugh's nomination for the entire Senate was to be held.
However, Flake said that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigated the allegations of the candidate the next week, as the Democrats in the minority urged him.
Flake's conversations with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democrat, have been won.
Flake decided on the basis of conversations with Coons and later with other senators.
He lived in accordance with the decision of Flake, as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve the nomination of Kavanaugh.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit of political play
In an interview with Sunday Times on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the plans to leave the European Union to threaten the future of the United Kingdom with political play and undermine the interests of the nation.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, will arrive at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
May’s former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea is to treat the customs of Britain and the EU with a complete absurdity.

Vulkan to flood Mexico City with ash
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
After the volcanic activity increased in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash shootings took place in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several moorings and cracks.
On social portals, in some districts of Mexico City, for example in Xochimilco, the windshields of cars are covered by a thin hammer.
The geophysics detected an increase in the activities of the volcano from the capital of Mexico from 72 km southeast, after a earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017 was hit by a major earthquake in Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police categorized with separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona, after the independence party protesters hit the police and more than a thousand joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the presidential referendum on Catalonia.
The group of vasarcos separatists with eggs and paint powder threw down the recapturers, so the streets with other tourists were now covered with dense dust.
In the later part of the day, further defeats occurred, during which the police tried to maintain the order with rubberbot.
“We don’t forget, we didn’t forgive,” slogen scandalal independence groups and “Life behind the Spanish” slogans stood against each other for hours.
According to reports from the local press, fourteen people were killed with minor injuries during the protests.
The tension continues to decline in the region that has undergone independence efforts, after the referendum on 1 October, which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The electors voted with a large majority in favour of the separation, although the participation rate was quite low, as most of the Unionists have bogged the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in the polls with aggressive attacks.
The independence party groups were on Friday nights across the street to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration did not end up on the normal route.
According to Narcis Termes 68-year-old electrician who is married to the Separatist protests, there is no chance that Catalonia will gain independence.
“It was one of the best times of our lives.
“I saw my parents taking pleasure in voting for us, but now our case has been painful,” he said.
Although a significant victory has been achieved in the last December regional elections, even if there is a narrow victory, the Catalan independent parties are difficult to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders are drawn into voluntary exiles or are expected to be arrested to bring the court's judgment in order to organise the referendum and to play their role in the post-inclusion of independence.
According to the 42-year-old automaker Joan Puig, who recorded a protest to support the police, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tighter,” he said.
The negotiations have been announced on Saturday by the leader of one of the Catalans waiting for pre-trial arrests, Oriol Junqueras, who announced that the European Parliament elections will start next year.
“I can reject the defamation of democratic values and the oppression that the Spanish Government represents when I am a candidate in European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men driving their cars into a house
Police arrested a 33, 34 and 39-year-old man who drove their car into a house with their car in Londonderry.
The incident occurred around 19:30 at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself was damaged.
It may have been shot at the car at a certain moment.
Menga's goal was to beat Livingston's Rangers to 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal is to convince Livingston's victory.
The first class, Livingston, was a great surprise to Rangers' team to get Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working as a coach at the ibrox club since 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference because Gary Holt's team went to a dead race with Hibernia's team in the second place.
The Gerrards, therefore, remained without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish league, and will face the first-place Hearts team on Sunday, with eight points left.
However, the Rangers are still waiting for a match on Thursday in the European League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his series of division competitions to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller has not yet been awarded the team since last month.
Livingston has lost a number of situations against the impeccable guest team.
Holt's team could have had the lead before the game's only goal, since there were little problems with their attacking games for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the same defense of the opponent, but he pulled the attack too hard, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball in front of the line.
The home team allowed Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure to be able to disturb guests in fixed gaming situations.
The final goal was born from a situation like this.
The Rangers had a release, and Livingston found a gap in defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who invented it in the middle of the sixteenth century.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led in the same football, but domestic protection continued to prove unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the game, with the exception of a single situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt at Rangers' gate, Allan McGregor's leg, and Lithgow's got his way out of livingston's new release.
The cross-directed ball continued to arrive at the fifteenth of Livingston, but the defenders were sent every time. Two offenders were not received by the offensive team: one Halket was the entry of Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other due to hand.
“Fenomenal – game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaron is Alasdair Lamont, a BBC Scotland scientist.
Livingston had a phenomenal performance and landed the beans.
The players were one-to-one excellent and have gone beyond expectations.
The team’s members and game style have barely changed since they returned to the top, but Holt’s efforts deserve a serious recognition, since the arrival of the coach, have greatly encouraged the team.
Many players have brought the best form.
The poor team captain made a great deal with the protection of his organization, and Menga was properly shocked by Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they were at times under Gerrard’s leadership, they were now unable to bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – otherwise it was only once that they could break down the domestic defense – and Rangers had to get themselves together quickly, because they fell back to the middle of the field.
Erdogan found a mixed welcome in Cologne
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a pleasure to have a breakfast meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of the visit to Erdogan, Germany, aimed at improving the relationship between NATO and NATO.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne, a newly built, huge mosque opening ceremony.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police banned the assembly of 25,000 people before the mosque, but several supporters of the President appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, including many Kurds, expressed their rejection of Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to accept the Prime Minister.
The two opposing protests are an excellent example of the myth that divides the President's policy, which is celebrated as a hero by some German citizens of Turkish origin, while others see the autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: a bike car crashed and lost his life
He lost a biker's life when he hit a car in London.
The carambol took place at the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a large road to deptford in the southern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. at local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the bombers tried to help the bike, but he lost his life on the spot.
The crash took place just a few months after another bicycle-sleeved gasification has become a deadly victim on the Childers Street, just a mile from the location of the Saturday accident.
According to the London police statement, police continue to work to establish the identity of the man so that they can notify the relatives.
Due to the investigation, roadblocks and bus expansions make transport more difficult, and the authorities advise that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards have been injured during a riot
Six prison guards have been injured in an indictment of a strictly guarded man in prison, the prison director announced.
The riots began at 09:30 a.m. in the Long Lartin Prison at the workshop.
In order to address the situation, the competents were guided to the site by a special trend called ‘Tornado’. In the riots, eight disciplines are involved, which have been pushed back into a building wing.
The members of the special development suffered only minor head injuries that were managed on the site.
A statement by the spokesman for the Penalty Executive Organization: “Scientificly trained prison team manages the situation in the Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
In our prisons, we will not tolerate violence at any level. We will transfer the responsible persons to the police and may expect further imprisonment.
In Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners are held in prison, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be given hospital treatment after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, special development was also needed to help put down a serious disturbance, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiards.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation of droughts can improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depressions, but it is expected that the state will have to count on it at the beginning of the next week, when the remnant of hurricanes crucifixed by Rosa will pass through the deserted southwest region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the southern areas of California and Utah; the preparation also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa says you're going to go straight through Phoenix's city on Tuesday, where you're expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains with you.
The phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cycles have reached within the 200-mile area of the tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile area of Phonenix!
The hurricane Katrina (born 1967), for example, approached the border of Az for 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurrikan Centre predict 50-100 mm precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, for example in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest desert areas (mediums of the Scillage Mountains, the Great Sea, etc.) can be calculated as a precipitation of between 25 and 50 mm, but 100 mm may fall in some places.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning water, as it is currently affected by severe drought.
Despite the serious danger of flooding, some of the rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the southern-west landscapes that are fighting the airport.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, over 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by a minimum extreme drought, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
The hurricane Rosa will first be on the island of Alsó-Kalifornia in Mexico.
It remains hurricane-based and will be brought in the Sunday morning, up to 137 km/h, about 600 km south of the land language of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and it will take approximately 19 km/h to the north.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
Thus, the coasts of Mexico are expected to be reached again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening hours.
It can be calculated for raining in some areas of Mexico, which significantly increases the chance of developing floods.
“The rainfalls can lead to a rainfall of between 70 and 50 mm from Also-Kalifornia to the north-west part of Sonora, where rainfalls can fall 250 mm in place,” says Weather.com’s report.
Rosa then goes through Mexico as a tropical storm, before Tuesday, she reaches Arizona's border at dawn, in the form of a tropical depression, to go through Arizona, Tuesday to the southern areas of Utah.
“The biggest threat caused by Rosa and its remains in Alsó-Karifornia, Northwest Sonoro, and the extraordinary rainfall expected in the southern desert areas of the United States will be,” the National Hurrikan Centre said.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning water and canal flow in desert areas, and in mountainous areas should be kept from earthquakes.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people were arrested with suspicion of a murder attempt
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspicion of a murder attempt after finding a 16-year-old young man in Somerset.
Saturday, local time at 04:00 a injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately transported to hospital, his condition is “stable”

The public is asked by the authorities to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone recording.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to take away the “bad initiative and anger of the Democratic Party.”
“Those who vote for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the unrivaled and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in the city of Wheeling in West Virginia.
According to Trump, in his nomination for Kavanaugh, the Democratic Party had to take away its “bad initiative and anger.”
Kavanaugh showed himself in front of Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasay Ford's claim that he committed sexual violence as a teenager for decades earlier.
In the hearing, Ford witnessed and stood in addition to his previous claims.
On Saturday, the president said, “The Americans saw it with their own eyes,” that day, Kavanaugh’s brilliant and terrible character,
“One of the most outstanding legal professionals in our day with Judge Kavanaugh, who has an unmasked public service prejudice,” Trump said to his supporters in West Virginia.
President Kavanaugh spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the inter-term elections.
“It’s only five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not going personally, but I’m actually starting,” he said.
“I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats follow the tactics of \"prevention and blockage\".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, said a leading Republican adviser to CNN.
Hundreds of people died in an indona earthquake, and the number of dead is rising.
Many people have lost their lives, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when the giant waves have reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and fountain on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered together at the festival held on Friday in Palu, when the high waves of nearly six meters (18 feet) reached the coast at the bottom, many were scattered, and all that was destroyed in their way.
The fountain was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the escape alarm came up yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not escape from the one, so the waves became a victim,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at the Japanese press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come with you, cars, timbers, houses, and all the others were drawn from the beach,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was at a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea before it reached the coast.
There were those who climbed the top of the trees from the price and fled, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people have evacuated to 24 shelters please.
In the air shots published by the Agency on disaster, there are several destroyed buildings and business premises, several grated and collapsed bridges, as well as a water-rounded mosque.
On Saturday, further exorcisms of the coastal city were struck.
Earthquakes could be perceived in an area of about 2.4 million people live in.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), more than 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than in the Second World War.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the geographical features resulting from this could strengthen the impact of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused by “a significant,” thousands of homes were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
More victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and he added, that the number of injured people was up to 540, and they were looking for another 29 people.
According to Nugroho’s statement, the number of injured people in the area called Donggala and the damage caused could be even greater, as it was closer to the epicenter of earthquakes.
Communication “has been completely paralyzed, cannot get information about Donggala,” Nugroho said.
“More than 30,000 people live there,” he said in the Red Cross Communication, where the organization’s professionals and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse,” he added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about the fact that he did not inform the population of the Palestinian fountain, but, according to the leadership, the waves had already reached the coast while the alarm was released.
A man who tries to warn people on the street with desperate screams on the upper floor of a building can be seen on one of the social sites.
Within a few minutes there will be a huge waterfall on the coast, driving cars and buildings with you.
The Reuters News Agency has not been able to prove the authenticity of the recording yet.
The earthquake and the escape price caused a lack of power, uninhabiting communication around Palu, making it harder for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military transport of air cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will still need food and other essential needs articles.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to facilitate assistance work, and for all other purposes it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centres that have been set up on Sunday.
The number of refugees in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu, where employees found refuge under the tents set up in the yard of the office, but they met the traces of terrible destruction on their way, said Dose.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
The situation is very bad.
While the relief teams were involved in the preparation of disaster prevention work, some complained that foreign experts with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, aid, assistance and staff from all sea-wides can only be allowed to the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared a disaster-related area at national level.
This hasn't happened until now.
“The case continues to be treated as a province-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As the government acknowledges that it is indeed a national disaster, we may allow international aid services, but there has been no announcements yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s uprising and escape, I would ask the friends and family members of the missing ones to hope that they would also be loved by those whose escape into wonders is a little light for the dark atmosphere of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channel.
On Sunday, the workers were able to release a woman who was two days behind the body of her mother under the ruins.
Gendon Subandono, the commander of the Indonesian National Scuba Team, prepared two competitors for the Asian Games, which were held this time in Indonesia, from the missing syllables at the beginning of the month.
Other students outside the streets were also in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a Venetian scubator, what happened is a great spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon pointed out that when the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel began to spread between the screaming umbrellas, he was desperate to reach the contestants who were participating in the beach festival for hours.
In addition to the messages, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 was robbed while filling a bank machine at Newport on the Levee Shopping Center
On Friday morning, thieves kidnapped $26,750 from a team member of Brink’s, who spent just one ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, standing in the press release of the Newport Police Department.
The manager of the money supplier car just emptys a bank automation in the entertainment center and was prepared to upload additional banknotes, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
He approached Brink’s employee from a man’s “back,” as long as it was occupied with his work, and stole one of the prepared wallets.
Witnesses have seen several alleged perpetrators escape from the site, but the exact number of suspects in the police statement is not included.
Anyone who would provide information about the identity of the perpetrators may contact the Newport police on the telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper's name for Yé has changed
Kanye West, the rapper's name from now on, Ye.
The change was reported on Twitter on Saturday by the following message: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old Westet has been called Ye by many, and this was the title of the eighth album released in June.
The name change was announced before Saturn Night Live, where he will also present his new album, Yandhi.
The show takes over Ariana Grande, who, referring to “sensual reasons, has resigned the performance,” the show said.
The new name is not only a shortening of the current artist name of the rapper, but also a religious significance for West, according to its earlier statements.
“I know that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, it means “te” that West mentioned earlier when he spoke about his album’s address with the radio director Big Boy.
So it's me and I, and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it became only Ye, which represents the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are.
Ye is one of the famous rappers who change their name with pre-similarity.
Sean Combs, for example, has been running under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he has now preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-founder, JAY-Z, also repeatedly varied by the need to write his name together, tie it up, or maybe write with a big one.
Mexican president has accepted that he will not take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president of Mexico, has promised that he will never take the force against civilians.
López Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square said, \"While he will not use the army to suppress the Mexican people...
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire in the field to participants of a peaceful demonstration, causing about 300 deaths when left student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help mexican young people – a monthly financial contribution to students and plans to set up additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that bring young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China is becoming increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the support for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor of artificial intelligence solutions and an employee who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He then said that the U.S. government had reported artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. did not have official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country’s goal is to become the world’s number one MI developer by 2030.
\"The doubled cost frame of MI research would be an appropriate start, as all other countries remain significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the field of MI,\" Lee said.
By doubled the research support, the possibility of making the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States could also be doubled, said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” appeared this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in China’s most important company, MI, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked at the University of Carnegie, a MI system that managed to defeat the best U.S. Othello player, and later served as a head of Microsoft Research and as president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the technological competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the results of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when to arrange the next such event, because at this time, it is possible to explore new future formats.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the state support needed for their research, Lee said.
“China is not going to kill scientific leaders, but large companies,” he added.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have written several major university skulls over the past few years to work in MI.
According to Lee, the change in immigration policy could greatly help the US's efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a doctorate degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s national natural science base provides support to academic institutions in a similar way, as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations share money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
This year, the Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends $100 million a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which designed to establish a national security MI committee, has not taken any further steps for the purpose of this matter for months.
In Macedonia they hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
The population of Macedonia was asked to change the country's name to the Republic of Mexico on Sunday's referendum, with this step to resolve a series of decades of disagreement with Greece, which prevented the acceptance of the country's EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is a need for a similar Greek area, which is why it has so far defended NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments agreed on the new name of the state, but according to national emotional opponents, the ethnic identity of the majority of the population in Macedonia would be undermined by the name change.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the launch of the boycott campaign, he doubted whether there would be a 50% participation rate for the current referendum.
The question on voting parties is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and agree to the agreement with Greece?’
The supporters of the name change, Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price in order to be one of the countries raised in the Yugoslavian ruins, to be able to join the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that Macedonia’s young people can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79).
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough Members have announced that they feel obliged to make the vote.
There are two thirds of the majority required to change the name in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% so far. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections ( 66% of the registered voters eventually participated).
“I came to vote for my children because we are in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who gave up his vote in the capital of Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and son, Duskko, have taken their Voks in Strumica, the referendum of 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In the synagogue before the Parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage as well as chairs and tents for boxers.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we want to join with proud, elevated heads and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of the European integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, the NATO membership could be counted on investments in Macedonia, which the country with a higher unemployment rate of 20% needs.
“I think that the majority will support our case, because more than 80% of the population of the country is essentially supporting the EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said.
He also added that the \"yes\" vote means \"the guarantee of the future of the country\".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30-43% of voters will be expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Based on another survey made by Macedón Telma TV, 57% participation rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% of the people who want to vote said they're going to do it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least one vote more than 50%.
The inaccuracy of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party Government, which was taken over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, player of Manchester City to get the full Brighton defense with a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have been thoroughly accused of defending Brighton, so Manchester City won a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Anglia Etihad Stadium.

Argentina's battle is the first step of the attack to get a pass on the middle track, and
Between the three defenders in Brighton, he got out of the open field.
Then four green beads surrounded Aguero.
He took a defender and then ran over to the sixteenth of Brighton.
Then he went to the left for Sterling that came up there.
The English battler has already returned the ball to Aguero within the fifteenth, with a force of force, who has completed the action on his right foot, inventing the right side of the Brighton net, Mathew Ryan gate.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” he told reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City.
We agreed to play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, you’ll get the goal –

The goal was born in 29 minutes, when
Aguero, who lives in the Brightons Square, received a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossroads on the left side of Leroy Sane.

On the blue battle, he was just able to put the ball in the gate before he slipped outside the base line.
The City will play in Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday, 12:55, with Hoffenheim's team in the League of Champions.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies difficult.
Since the Nationals team missed the possibility of getting into the afterseason, they had no reason to really work on it.
However, Scherzer, who is always a competitive spirit, is hardly waiting to stand on Sundays against Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play the game. Rockies is a game-playing advantage in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
Rockies have assured themselves at least one place of comfort with the victory of the 5-2 Nationals on Friday night, but their first address is still waiting for you.
“Although we no longer have a chance, we can stand against them that in Denver, the atmosphere of the audience and the other team is expected to be on the roof of the year.
Of course, I want to be on the track like this.
The Nationals team still has to choose the beginner for Sunday, but according to the news, Scherzer will be the drummer in this situation.
Scherzer, who took part in a shooting exercise on Thursday, will be the 34th launch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player is 18-7 this season, with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 of the game.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation surrounding Mr Kavanaugh, the Supreme Judge, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the inter-term elections.
“In November, everything we have done so far is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones – I am not going personally, but I am actually going to go everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued to say: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democratic groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are really determined, and they are able to take any means to regain power, see evil and humility.
It doesn’t matter who is harmed, who is cut in order to be in control of their hands, to have power. That’s what they want, control and power, but we don’t leave ourselves.
According to the president, the Democrats call for \"prevention and blockage\".
“They could have seen all this in the last four days,” he said, “an angry and malicious and low and lying,” calling the Democrats.
According to a name, Diane Feinstein spoke of a Democrat Senator, a member of the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee, which announced the loud narration of the crowd gathered.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, wait, all this with a very bad body talk, it was the worst body talk I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who speak freely what they think
I wasn’t surprised when the activists of Momentum in my own party decided on my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in the long series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated like this, for failing to deal with anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like me to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with former leaders.
At the invitation of the working party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, they said they wanted “a welcoming spirit and productive meeting.”
In most of my eight years as local representatives of the Labour Party, these meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Today, however, there has been a change in voice and the promise of a more resounded, polite policy has been forgotten if it has ever been achieved.
It is more and more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and all opinions are judged to be acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, recently expected to turn their backs on my individual opinion, and I would take a position with which I would never agree, whether national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, whatever I actually said, they start to hang out on the social pages, my replacement, criticise the politics that move to the center, and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
This is not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues because the comments I have received are usually focused on politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to attack sexual and racist attacks on a daily basis, yet they do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of our politics is that such attacks have become norms.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have resigned from diversity, and all the “infidelity” initiatives and any changes to the electoral rules are increasingly limited in the party.
Over the past few years, many have been advised to take me back, not to be so symphony, and then “all will be fine.”
But that's not why I'm on the political track.
32 years ago, even as a student, I joined the Labour Party because it was shocked that the Thatcher government neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed, and then I fought for a better approach to those most in need as a local counsellor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views under the vet, and I have not done anything else in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was entirely clear to everyone what political positions I represent and which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country goes towards a Brexit that is not only for families, but also for companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy to question my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party.
My main message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, regardless of whether I am a member of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there is no change or political threat of any kind from acting in my own opinion and taking account of everyone's interests.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr is unbeatable at the top
Two late attempts have slightly changed in the end, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s worthy victory at the most exciting match of the day, Tennessee’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one in ten teams is unbeatable.
Thanks to their unspoken defenses and superior use of the situation, they won, so that the natives and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet a lot of challenges during our matches, but we’re still unbeatable, so I have all the reasons for happiness,” he said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made a lot better use of his situation than we do.
Grant Anderson did a 14-minute experiment, from which Frazier Climo did the point, and Ayr got into the game. Thanks to the yellow card from the Captain Barry Hughes Scottish, the Melrose could have torn the difference, but it wasn't exactly Jason Baggot's attempt.
Climo inspired Ayr’s protection with a criminal, at half-time, and then obtained a point from a single experiment, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results in Ayr’s favor.
Melrose started the second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagget, reducing the team's disadvantage to five points.
Then, the game stood for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to take it off the track, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose babbers managed to overcome with Climo's involvement.
Blair Macpherson, Captain Ayr, also got a yellow card and Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment from breaking the pressure on them.
The domestic team began to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card, why he got Climo without a ball, MacPherson showed a touch down from the crime line behind Ayr's crash team.
Climo sold what he said almost immediately after the reboot, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry a shot at the fifth attempt at home.
Still Game’s main character started a new career in the hospitality industry
One of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the hospitality industry: the light is discovered that a restaurant was taken to the head of the company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in the popular series of the BBC, which he writes together with and where he works with his old comedian Greg Hemphhill.
The couple announced that the next 9th season will be the final season, and that Kiernan would have planned his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to take advantage of Glasgow’s flowering hospitality industry.
“The sea is ours,” says Bolivia, who is not on the coast hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines are patrolling the sailing command in La Paz.
In the middle, ocean flags are sinking.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are the following myth: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover
The memories of the lost coast, which were taken by Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century for resources, are still alive in Bolivia without the coast, and there is a strong desire to recap the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
For many decades, these hopes may have been the most powerful one, since Bolivia is waiting for the end of October, five years of consultation.
“There is a ball at the Bolivia, which floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, waiting for the final development in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat in Bolivia.
A lot of Bolivians are following the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will stand next to Bolivia, and Chile will be required to sit at a negotiating table after several decades of rapsodic attitudes to give Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, native-born president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial struggle to continue for the next year’s re-election, can lose a lot with the Monday’s judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and it would not change much in the situation if its decision would still be favorable for Bolivia.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands has no right to judge the Chilean territories, and it has also previously concluded that it will not affect the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was only six months after the closures indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Zárate Paz, a Chilen expert in international law.
In addition, for the past four years, he did not help Bolvelia, but even put it back.
“The question of the sea exit was addressed by the current government in Bolivia to its own objectives,” said Zate.
Because of the hostile rhetoric of Morales, the rest of the Chileans have also landed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at one point, but after all, it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue.
Since 1962, the two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolvelia's representative in the Hague, disagreed with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually fast.
For Monday, Bolivia has a “extractive opportunity to open a new chapter in the relations with Chile,” and it is a chance to come out of the close of “139 years of conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to impose a political advantage.
“Bolvelia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” she added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: There is no nuclear disposal until they can trust America.
According to Ri Jongho, North Korean Foreign Minister, his country will not be the first to land nuclear weapons if they cannot trust in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to adhere to the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the summit in Singapore.
The comment was made when it appeared that Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had been able to re-start the nuclear negotiations with the North Korean leader Kim Dsongun after the Singapore summit.
According to Ri, “I strongly believe that the US’s continued sanctions and a declaration closing the Korean war will never be enough to force North Korea on its knees.
Washington follows the acceptance of the statement if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards the removal.
Both Kim Jsongun and Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, widespread skepticism leads to Phenjan's commitment to the removal of the arsenal, to which the country's security is likely to be the only key.
Pompeo is planning a phenjani visit next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
In Paris fashion shows, there are huge headglasses that will soon appear in the top-class shops.
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to completely cover the day, you don’t have to look for it anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of unusually oversized heads as part of their 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which was welcomed by the stylish audience in Paris.
No practical hats were called on Instagram during the summer, and the above fashion designers also set their attention to the launch.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an oversized beige hat, which was penile, wide-scale karma decorated and almost completely swallowed the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements, the Greek curtains, a magic hat, and even an ananas, which were not really designed to keep the man's head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with the choice of bizarre masks, even at the same time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths folded together, and they reminded Hannibal Lectre more than the six country.
One such piece was like a diving mask, supplemented with a pipe and glasses, and one was painted like an ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
Style analysts predict that huge hats may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path \"La Bomba\", a 60 cm wide cardboard from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the social sites showed a new piece of the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost as much as the swimwear.
The dark orange rape bag – which is decorated by rafia booms, and on top of it there is a white leather coat – was one of the outstanding pieces of the collection of Jacques 2019’s Spring/Summer La Riviera in Paris on the fashion week.
The star's stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: \"I expect that by summer, huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top-class clothing stores. The designer has created a fundamental effect for everyone to deny the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language Knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. Looking at the new outstanding research results, this situation did not change until 2018, which is only further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are studying such institutions as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are seeking to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare students for further learning, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, it comes to your head.
If you speak in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with other countries.
From this year’s exams we see that students from independent schools have brought the best results from foreign languages across the country.
68% of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher degree (more than 85 percent result).
Based on data collected from SCIS 74 member schools, 72% of students received a higher A degree in Mandarin, while 72 German students, 69 French and 63% of Spanish students achieved A degree.
These results also support the fact that the independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as chosen objects have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics as both independent and other schools.
The 2014 survey of the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training showed that 17 percent of employers found that filling blank positions is difficult due to their lack of language knowledge.
We can also see that language learning is becoming increasingly necessary to enable young people to pursue a successful career.
As knowledge of foreign languages is expected in more and more jobs, language knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses when he learns a foreign language, he acquires a long-lasting knowledge of which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically provides a competitive advantage to those who speak multiple languages.
According to YouGov’s survey, in which 4,000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013, 75% of respondents were not well enough in any foreign language to speak to others, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15%).
This is why it is important that we focus on the teaching of children.
Talk in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children with which they can apply for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, they will deal with different languages in each school.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever the interests of the child, you will learn several elective languages at independent schools and will be trained by teachers who are experts in your field.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, to maintain whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to note that languages are still vital for the future of a country in today’s global business environment, and that education should also reflect this.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as \"international communication skills\".
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this must be the case.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is present in San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
They don't have to wait long for fans who are sitting on needles to see LeBron James in Los Angeles Lakers' colors for the first time.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the first Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the track is still a question.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers' scientist Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited period of time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were with Lakers in the six-mex season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the first season to be ready,” he said.
Trump West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be Trump’s first five incarnate events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote of the candidate of the Supreme Court's vacant place has been postponed, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next half-time elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump start today's Western Virginia event, and where to follow online?
The speech of Trump Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s Western Virginia meeting online through YouTube live streaming.
Trump is likely to be affected by his supreme court candidate, Mr Kavanaugh's weekly hearing, which proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's strengthening vote was suspended for a maximum of one week until the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary goal of the suddenly-spoken events is to help Republicans’ situation before the November elections.
According to Trump’s campaign advisor, next week’s five events serve the activation of voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that are currently held in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“To be able to control Congress in his hands, it is so critical to his political plans that the President will visit as many states as possible. We look at it as a busy campaign period,” said a campaign speaker asking Reuters to hear his name.
Wesbanco Arena is planning today to bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even the media reports in Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the surveys, is not in a good position.
“It’s no good for Morrisey to be personally involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of Western Virginia, Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is fighting full range of shoulders before Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup needed a lot of matches.
The shirt of luck and the moment-over is a sport concept obtained from a rather air, yet every player believes in it, most of the competitions like Ryder Cup.
So who has the ball?
“They had six points of leadership, and they have only four advantages, so we can say that the ball is right here,” Jordan Spieth said, as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, there are four points that Europe still runs, and it can still be obtained by twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they finally got a little back wind, and they can encourage more than anything, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both got three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from the start-up to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The storms of victory became more loud, as he went forward with the circle, hit and matched by a critical twist in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in double disadvantages after two.
The turning of the game at the 15th hole led to a similar exhilaration of joy, a kind that can believe the viewer is not all lost to the American team.
“You just have to dig deep in yourself, and only take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trace.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple of Ryder Cups could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but loving couple made four out of four, and it seems they can't make mistakes.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple who did not perform the parade on Saturday afternoon, and provided similar performance on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to the dynamic between this series and among them and the audiences that supported them, they became the poison by Sunday, and no one expects the sun to secure Europe’s victory in the Le Golf National career as Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best one at a time would be a win at different holes.
However, it is still early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon executed by Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning, when she played with Alex Noren.
Once with one and two strikes above the bar, the first nine holes were Spanish and Swedish, which brought them to a wave valley, where they had no chance to climb out.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of the pit.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are extremely entertaining from a close perspective thanks to the interaction of couples. You can see who gives you the advice that you don’t give and how you can change the strategy in a glance.
Europe has been a better team, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this fourth section has shown that the team in the United States has the need to fight, and that many of them, especially from the American side, have been lacking in the struggle.
Europe begins the last day of Ryder Cup with 10-6 benefits
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after closing the four-ball and four matches on Saturday with 10-6 results against the United States.
The speedy Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair to two wins against the vulnerable Tiger Woods, thereby raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National track.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated by the ever-deprived American team in the four-ball matches of the morning, winning the series by 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance during the fours, bringing two matches, but they couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from Sunday's 12 individual match to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who, after the end of a sensation weekend, are only “Molliwood” – the second pair of the history of Ryder Cup, which gained four points in four opening matches.
After defeating Woods-Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. novel, Bryan Dechambeau's twins for a determined 5&4.
Woods, who attracted himself to two games on Saturday, sometimes made his talent easier, but from 29 matches he lost 19 of the four balls and fours, seven of them.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours he defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third position of the World Ronglist.
However, Europe has not succeeded in all of this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time title protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturday showed the Americans how to do this.
A tormented 2&1 victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four battles, and later returned to defeat Poulker and Roy McIlroy in 4&3 ratios after losing the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, only twice a team managed to come back from a four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although one of Furyk's title defenders is enough to keep the trophy.
After two days, however, only the second best was achieved, a Sunday counterattack seems unreal.
“It is not clear that North Korea is unilaterally disincentived if they do not trust the negotiating partner.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the confidence that was felt against the United States, and it was excluded that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken significant and ambitious steps in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, closing the site of nuclear experiments and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“We don’t see similar answers from the Americans,” he said.
“In the absence of trust in America, we feel that the safety of our nation is not ensured, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are unilaterally and first –
Although Ri retreaded North Korea’s disappointment in opposition to the idea of “season” nuclear disposal, which, as a scenario, would receive North Korea’s rewards for the steps that had been taken so far, its statement seemed important, however, because he did not expressly reject unilateral nuclear disposal as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dzongun and Donald Trump at the former summit between the former president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, and in which Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disposal of the Korean Peninsula” until Trump guaranteed North Korea’s integrity.
North Korea is trying to make an official point by the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but, according to the United States, Phenjan must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not allow strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start nuclear deportation and impose sanctions on us to force his will on us, and he also protests against the possibility of declaring war closures,” said Ri.
“The idea that we can be forced to suffer with sanctions is a desire for those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-reducing sanctions only increase our suspicions.
Ri did not mention that it was planned to be a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, the president of the United Nations called in a separate speech at the beginning of the week.
The minister pointed out that there were three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Dzein in the last five months, and added: “If the country involved in the nuclear disposal was South Korea, not the United States, then the nuclear disposal of the Korean Peninsula would not have been such a situation.
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the target of North American continents is inevitable with North Korean missiles, after Trump, “the evil President, Kim,” who was on a suicide mission.
In this year, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “full destruction” threatened North Korea with praise, said he had the courage to take steps towards the disposal, but he also noted that there was still a lot of work left, and sanctions remain until North Korea carried out nuclear disposal.
On Wednesday, Trump said that they did not impose a time limit, i.e. “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On Thursday, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be complied with in an unsatisfied manner until they have reached the actual, final, proven nuclear disposal.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly at the end of his term, and then said he would return to Phenjan the next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea later accused him of \"gender claims\".
In the course of the meeting with Munna this month, North Korea promised to remove a missile base and a nuclear facility, if the United States will take sufficient steps.
According to Mun’s statement, “the steps taken by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore, or steps that could lead to normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to rest enough
A new study at Harvard University this year, students have been living in several sleeps, fighting against the culture of the cat that has become more and more spaced by caffeine.
An academic concluded that students of the world’s number one universities are often completely lost if they are talking about how they should care about themselves.
The course, according to the first such training in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical College, and practiced as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of a course that previously held a presentation on the impact of sleeping on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked me, “Why do I end up faced with this?”
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised him,” he told Telegraph.
During the first course of this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of appropriate sleeping habits on their performance in education and sport, except that they have a positive impact on their general public perception.
According to Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard College and Director of the University’s Health Service, the university decided to start the course, because during the week students were found to be impatient.
The one-hour course also includes a number of interactive tasks.
One example shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gymnasiums and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, by how sports performance affects insomnia, and why it is important for sleeping routines.
In another part, it is reported to the participants how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They show a map of the university’s areas with interactive icons to help participants think about the daily routine.
“We know that we will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to know these skills, as you have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture in which performance is expected to go through one night is still flourishing, he said, adding that the constant pressure on modern technology and students results in increasing problems.
Sufficient and high quality sleep protects students from “secret weapon” in the fight of stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even obesity, as sleep loss forces them to hunger in the brain and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop his course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biology, and last year Harvardon took one of the professor's courses.
He said that they heard him open his eyes and encouraged him to go to a university-level training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before they are located in the field of competition.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set a warning to bed, wake up, and learn about the harmful effects of electric screens and LED light sources, which could easily reduce them from the rhythm of the day and make them more difficult to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gets the goal
Rangers suffered another foreign defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb Steven Gerrard lost his team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxs tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 win in February, St. Johnstone, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team as a manager from 18 matches. Thus, they will remain eight points from the first position of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship), the Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before half-time, and the unmotivated crew of Rangers didn't fit close to the equation.
While Rangers fell down to sixth place, Livingston caught up to the third, just missing from Hibernia because of the gap.
Rangers may face further difficulties after a medical treatment due to the head injury of Calum Spence due to the presence of the beach signal is likely due to an object dropped out of the sight of the guests.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that came into the premier of the Betfred Cup with Ayr.
It's the same way that Livingston took off with the same 11 people who picked up a point from Hearts last week, and would certainly have looked happily at the way his team was suffocating the opponent's game there, where it was for him.
Although Rangers led the ball, Livingston took more than what he got.
The first two minutes they could've gotten a go-to in the first two minutes, when Scott Pittmant Allan McGregor started his first injection, but the midfielder couldn't sell the bag.
Keaghan Jacobs' low release landed at Craig Halkett's team captain, but his defender Alan Lithgow found only the side of the gate.
Rangers took control of him, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a criminal at the fifteenth minute when he fought Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson made his complaints.
Rangers had only the first two half-year-olds shot, but the former ibrox gate, Liam Kelly, had hardly caused a problem with Lassana Coulibally's head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute faced with the game, no one can deny that they deserve the chance, only for their hard work.
Rangers lost a piece of music forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react at a time when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who found Menga well for easy completion.
Gerrard decided in the break, Coulibally replaced Ryan Kentre, and it almost immediately revealed his influence on the game when the extreme Morelos was jumping, but the stunning form of Kelly was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to be able to play a game that met him, and Lithgow and Halkett were sweeping the long balls after each other.
Holt's team could have had a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and beat Jacobs' position before Lithgow was in a corner.
The Glenn Middleton, who was changing Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he collapsed with Jacobs, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger Accountator
A detailed “night of breakfast” from our almanachunk: September 30, 1882, just 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that could lead to a tool known as the Geiger Accountator.
The Geiger Accountator has been one of the basics of science, and thanks to the 1950s, strange cowboys, Roy Rogerst and Dale Evanst, \"Bells of Coronado\" (Coronado bells), also became part of the pop culture:
Man: “What is this miracle?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals such as uranium can be searched for.
If you put this headphone up, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Just listen to me, now it’s a bit of a path.
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he lives in his invention of his name.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see the anti-ractic cells”
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy the abnormal cells.
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be obtained from the patient and then changed in a laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immune cells are put back in the patient’s condition.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect anti-rival cells could have said goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the recovery of immune cells from the patient; we modify in the laboratory to ‘find’ the protein called HER2 which is a frequent companion of multiple cancers; then the replanting of the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.
Her2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lung and rectum cancer, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has already been successfully used to treat one of the types of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL, who wears a MAGA cap, was ranked in a Trumpot-sponsored tirada.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye Westet was suffocated in the Saturday Night Live studio after an in-depth manifestation of President Donald Trump, and then told President Donald Trump that he was going to run the presidential post in 2020.
After making the third song of the day in the title of Make America Great Again, Ghost Town began to speak against the Democrats and re-emphasized Trumpot to support it.
“Sometimes, when I talk to someone who is white, asks the question, “How can you like Trumpot because he’s racist?”
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Brett Kavanaugh, the Hollywood star, in his testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, was charged with the sexual harassment charges of Christine Blasay Ford.
Although not broadcast, the video about West was uploaded by Chris Rock humorist to social sites.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to drive from West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had been strangled for his hat.
“They were scared behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
They scared me!
And they told me I was in the frozen place,” Washington Examiner said.
West continued: “Do you want to see an isolated place? I’m wearing my Superman coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do?
Try with love.
His manifestations were at least twice accompanied by a physique from the audience, and the SNL actors were apparently embarrassed by one of Variety’s witnesses: “The whole studio was silently silent.
Westet Ariana Grande was named instead of a singer at the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
In addition, West asked questions when he made his song I Love it dressed as Perrier glasses.
West is the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner has provided support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: CREAMS, HOTEL OF THE REGIONS
Karen Hunter, host of a conversational show, tweeted that West was simply “self-made, and that’s great.”
“But I decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashion tricks or the support of his “artificial”), who I believe is an ideology that is harmful to the community that I belong to.
He's free.
But we too, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he’s “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and that's why he went to the prints of Diddy, whom we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg, also recorded the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, the ancient legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
The Belgian restaurant is charged with a human murder attempt.
A 45-year-old man is charged with a murder attempt after a man was killed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The prosecutions are reviewed by the prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the Battle of Thrones, finds the overexpressed masculineity harmful
Kit Harington is best known for the Battle of Thrones as Jon Snow, and in the fantasy series of HBO, which is full of violence, in the Middle Ages, it is often the sword itself.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke against stereotypical cat heroes, highlighting that, as such heroes saw, small boys often feel that hard action is needed to overcome respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said, “There was something wrong,” and he asked the question of how the problem of the harmful effect of over-manhood can be addressed in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married her 31-year-old, serial colleague, Rose Leslie, said she thought it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I am personally deeply affected by this issue – how has the depiction of manhood been distorted?” the actor asked.
“What we taught men about the problem we are facing in their childhood.”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of manhood’s distorted image, as the shows often feature very Masculin characters.
He added: “What is what happened to us, and what is what we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys, making them feel that they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our age – and how we can change this.
It is clear that something is not right with young men.
Who in the interview said that after the summer season of the series, the Thrones will not be included in the Harca history series or activities, because “there is a source of battles and horses.”
From November, Kit Sam Shepard True West will be playing a role in reprocessing his film, which is about a producer and his brother's life-long career.
The actor said that the best thing he got from the Battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he knew during the series.
“I met my wife at the shooting, so I can thank my future family and my life in front of me for the series,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who had the character of Kit, Jon Snow, was in love with Emmy's award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: In China, the number of new patients increased by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14% in the country.
According to health officials, this means more than 820 000 people.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to the previous, a significant number of newly infected people are sexually affected by the disease.
The disease previously spread rapidly in some parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in the province of Jünna said that the number of such cases has been reduced to almost zero since then.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Transfer of HIV sexually is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong ever since.
Based on estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men finally marry women due to the conservative value of the country.
In many cases, the disease spreads due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of the programme to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his crew members leaked Republican senators' data and condemns “sacrifice lies” and “competence theories.”
Mr. Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of his staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the senators.
According to the Commissioner for Democracy in Los Angeles, the claims in question were distributed by experts and websites.
“Peace, lies, and more low lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to include the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted to the Internet on Thursday. The publicist is unknown, but it is certain that they were published on Capitol domb, during the senate hearing of the highest court candidate for sexual harassment.
The leaking happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pound and RedState, can be linked to the IP address of the source to Waters office, and have also reported information about one of the members of Waters's status, The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
“My staff has no responsibility for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, the protection of personal data and security has been violated due to fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars.
Waters’ statements on the Internet were quickly criticised, including Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial,” she wrote.
“It seems that Waters does not have the blood temperature required for his representative’s office.
If someone is obsessive of something he didn't commit, he can't react angry.
You can't act dacally.
You can't question the accusations of the accused.
You need to stay calm and calm.
Waters’ reaction to Fleischer apparently compared Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to the Democratic Critics, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters representatives in the semi-age elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his statement that his office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies of the case of false charges.
“We hope that the person of the perpetrators will become aware, continued Waters, and that they will be legally liable for all acts that threaten or damage any member of the crew.”
Johnny English hit again, or Rowan Atkinson's spy game
Today, it has become a legacy that we are looking for references to Brexit in every British film, and there is no exception to this category of franchise under Johnny English, the first part of which, Johnny English 2003 and Johnny English, was recharged in 2011.
Will the British nation become a new export product for the sarcastic, self-defeating satires in which we live on our own, obvious paralysis?
There is so much certainty that the eyes of the merciless, rubber-like, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for a new return – it is clear from his name that this comedy character was created to make the masses of people looking at the movies of non-English native countries.
Johnny English, of course, is a hit secret agent who thinks he's a winner of the Bizarr's motto, so reminds me of a little Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally to the guy who had a single key print to play at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-time Barclaycard TV scene and left chaos everywhere.
There's a few good moments in the last Johnny English film.
I loved Johnny English putting me in a medieval armor, and then the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comedy veins are well in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it even affects, as today, the “commorous franchises” such as James Bond films or the Mission Imposible series are bravely reaching the tool of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and Johnny English is a fable, left-handed adventures do not reach the level of idealism and genius that Atkins brings to the silent scenes of Mr. Bean.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the super secret network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the worst terror of the agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, had only a small role in the film.
This may be the last point in the coffin of the prime minister of self-determination and division, whose political popularity is still in ruins: Emma Thompson practically transforms Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors suggest that, since all active agents were exposed, he must set up a restful agent for work.
This restless agent, of course, is nothing like the two-breed Johnny English, who has been working in a preschool since his retirement, but teaches children to spy differently from the curriculum – of course, there are funny scenes here, while he describes the basics of spying in English as a \"Rocksuli\" mode.
English is delivered quickly to Whitehall, where he meets his former, suffering weapons carrier, Bough, who is now forming Ben Miller.
Bough has since been married and married to a submarine captain, whose mouth is always on his ear, the captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has called for better roles.
Thus, his Majesty’s national security service will be rebooted by his two-breeded “Batman and Robin” and confront Ophelia Bulletova, who is shaped by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a true destiny woman.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly networked by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is shaping it.
English and Bough will start their clown mission: they will set fire to a fancy French restaurant, and then, in the midst of an amazing turn, they will smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English will actually free the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment by using a VR-headset.
These stations need us to get to the end, but it has managed to make any fun and turn-up, maybe too much of a child movie.
The result is quite medium.
As with the other Johnny English films, now I have a question: could the British film industry finally be a worthy part of Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party denies it to introduce a four-day work week while paying the British for a five-day job
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day work week work week.
The party is supposed to want workers to benefit from the benefits of the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution by providing workers with an extra free day thanks to increased income.
Based on the plan, the workers would have a three-day weekend while taking the same amount of home as they had been.
According to the sources, the idea of a party’s economic programme, which aims to reduce the language of the balance sheet to the worker’s side.
The four-day work week also supports the Congress of Trade Organizations, so they believe that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
One of the leaders of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is likely that the political review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it is not going to happen from one day to another, the four-day work week is an idea that fits the party’s programme, which would reduce the balance language to the workers in the economy, and also integrate the party’s comprehensive industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of the four-day working week.
However, the idea does not enjoy the full support of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day work week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the question is not even on the agenda.”
John McDonnell, the shadow finance minister, presented the idea of the socialist revolution on the economy last week at the Labour Party conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to fight to regain power from “unspoken directors” and from “responsors” to “responsors”
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were implemented, the shareholders of the water supply companies would not be able to recover the total profits they obtain, as a labour party government would ‘deposit’ as a penalty for the harmful activities that were considered.
McDonnell also confirmed that his plans would also make workers a member of the board of directors, and would create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, so that they could receive 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced in the \"60 Minutes\" show whether the FBI print on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
As a result of the FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh as the Supreme Judge will be held at least one week later. The question is whether the outcome of the investigation will be so unconfirmed by the Republican representatives that Kavanaugh is not yet supported.
In his interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Scott Pelley, journalist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked Republican senators if the FBI could find something that would make them think about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than a colleague in South Carolina.
“I understand, of course,” Kennedy said.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, and I asked him, “Did you do it?”
His answer was clear and clear.
However, Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I need very serious accusations to think about myself,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett has strongly denied the claims,” Graham added, under the title of Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford proved the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new would come up.
What is the Global Civil Festival, and has it been able to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event, the Global Civil Festival, starts in New York. Worldstars take place at the festival to stand for a truly noble goal: for the worldwide eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will now be held seven times, and it is expected that more than tens of thousands will be spent on Central Park’s Great Pasis, where participants will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also be able to draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the elimination of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Society Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is operated by an international interest group aimed at eliminating poverty by bringing more and more people into an active fight against poverty.
You can receive a free ticket for the concert (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake to carry out certain tasks or actions, such as voluntary work, sending an email to a leading politician, a telephone call, or any other relevant activity that can draw attention to the project's goal: to eliminate poverty.
But how successful was the global citizen in the past 12 years to achieve the goals set?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts to win others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clinkivism” when people feel worthy of contributing to a case by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” have been carried out by global citizens, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to making the world’s leaders 37 billion dollars separate from poverty policies and commitments that can affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed that they were from their actions and that they had already paid $10 billion or collected donations.
The group estimates that the money collected was directly affected by the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between the United Kingdom-based investors and developers, designed to help children achieve their potential – the organization promised $35 million to help Rwanda eliminate hunger after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from their “global citizens”
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can ban social injustice and under-responsibility among the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that, after the UK has been asked to improve the food of mothers and their children in more than 5,000 actions, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions published on the website of a global citizen is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated?
According to the global citizen, “It’s going to be a long and difficult way, sometimes we get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we also reach our goal, because together we are stronger.
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will also take part in this year's New York event, and the broadcasters will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of the Interior: U.S. Navy-Bloods to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington would even introduce the Navy to the market of Russian energy carriers, so, for example, the Russian energy could not be reached in the Middle East,” said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, Washington Examner.
Zinke claims that Russia’s active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations with the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And the Minister of the Interior says there are ways to prevent the Russians.
“The United States is able to ensure that its Navy is open to sea routes, and it can bring them under a block if necessary. Thus, it is able to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – otherwise, the nonprofit group defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, Washington compared its action against Russia and Iran, and noted that it was practically the same method.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, “one-dimensional economy,” pointing out the country’s dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby reducing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the President themselves, will win Germany to back down the \"free\" Northern Stream 2 pipeline project, which, if implemented, will make Germany a Moscow hostage.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is doubled by a 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 pipelines that increase 110 billion cubic metres.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is opposed to such a fierce project, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercise and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely select their suppliers,” said Alexander Novak, Russian energy minister after a September meeting with Rick Perry, a US minister of energy.
The US's efforts to convince people went backwards, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in the EU’s energy policy, as well as to keep itself away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin after the last meeting of Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI).
Elizabeth Warren's Massachusetts Senator, who has decided to start for the presidency in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren’s Massachusetts senator on Saturday said after half-time elections, “she’s considering to go for the presidency.
In Warren Massachusetts, at a municipal meeting in Holyoke, he confirmed that he would consider his departure.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and restore the poor government, and it is time for a woman to be president,” Warren said The Hill.
– After November 6, I will be seriously considering going for the presidency.
At the City Assembly, Warren described Donald Trumpot with criticism and said he thought he was taking the country in a \"bad direction\".
“I pay attention to the serious concern Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren criticises Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, there is a need for FBI investigation before the vote.
Based on a survey published on Thursday, however, most of Warren's masschusetts voters do not think Warren should start for the presidency in 2020.
Based on the political center of the University of Suffolki and the survey of Boston Globe, 58% of voting masschusetts electors say that the senator should not start for the presidency until
32% support Warren's presidential candidate.
Based on the survey, Deval Patrick’s former governor’s presidential candidate would be the majority of the respondents and 38% would support it, and 48% would be against it.
In the context of the 2020 presidential election, the name of high-ranking Democratic politicians, including former Vice-President Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Based on the report by Associated Press, Biden will decide whether to start until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD Meeting Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he applied in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night.
“As my son goes through what he has gone through since he returned home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to,” said Sarah Palin at the meeting of Donald Trump in Oklahoma.
The arrest of the son of Palin, called the elephant in the room, and said that his son, like the rest of the war veterans, turned back, and continued to walk in his mind to show proper respect for the service that all his associates, pilots, and other members of the army did for the country.
Track Palint was arrested for violence in the family of women in Alaska. Dan Bennett, the spokesman for the Washington police, said that Track Palin, according to a report, committed violence in the family.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the judicial review of the new US asylum policy, which means that those who are fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence will not be saved.
Representatives from 18 different Member States, and representatives from Washington D.C., wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who attacks policy in court, NBC News.
The full name of Grace vs Sessions, initiated against federal policy, was not disclosed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August.
According to the applicant, the partner and the “sons of a violent crime” were abused, but American officials refused their asylum request on July 20.
She's being held in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors of Grace-supported states, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have been described as places where many asylum claims have been filed to the United States, because in these countries there is a constant problem of violence by criminal gangs and within the family.
The new US refugee policy withdrew the decision taken by the Committee on the appeal of immigrants in 2014 (Board of Immigrant Appeals, BIA), which allowed non-documented immigrants to submit asylum claims in response to domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Chief Prosecutor of Washington, D.C., said in a Friday statement that the new policy \"outside the attention of several decades of state, federal and international law\".
“All asylum applications under federal law must be examined in accordance with the facts and circumstances in the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” he said.
In addition, prosecutors have also stated in the letter that the anti-immigrant policy is harmful to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become an entrepreneur and “fill the lowest level of jobs.”
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“The right to asylum concerns those who leave their country because of racial, religious, national nationality, belonging to a specific social group or political conviction, or a well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said on 11 June.
The right to asylum has not been invented to solve all the problems of people around the world as a day – whether they are of any serious nature.
A desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead is doubled, the ambulances run a race over time.
The situation of survivors is becoming more and more invisible.
“Everybody is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while calming a young boy with a fever in one of Palu’s evacuation centers.
The ambulance will bring the bodies every minute.
We hardly have drinking water.
Some residents returned to their home to save them from the lost things that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, are not convinced to see people.
Some of the injured people, including the broken spine and shoulder, were also transported to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were seen outside the hospital building because of high-strength extremities.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the fifth floor hotel room in which his wife and daughter were occupied, and he fell into the destructive uprising.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was stuck in the fallen walls, said Haris to Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it turned silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope you're safe.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of facing propaganda ads.
The Chinese Ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This was a week after an official Chinese newspaper reported a four-page advertisement in a newspaper that emphasized the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
US President Donald Trump reported on Wednesday in China’s Daily Des Moines Register, the largest copy of Iowa’s newspaper, and accused China of trying to intervene in American Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump accuses Beijing of trying to intervene in American elections, according to some U.S. officials reporting to Reuters, it is a new stage of action against Washington China with a view to putting China under pressure.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which new and new duties are imposed on each other's imported products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the commercial war, the Chinese customs authorities sought to target exporters from the countries in which Trump and the Republican Party were popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, Chinese Ambassador of the United States and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses, as Iowa State exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that “China is still scaring our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
“The Chinese government takes advantage of the great American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“If we go to a Beijing newspaper, we will hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not reflect the different views of Chinese people, unlike each other, on the growing prospects of the Chinese economy, because the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added: “One of China’s most famous newspapers refused to bring down his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
According to the speakers, the Republicans can move women’s voters to the Kavanaugh scandal before the semi-age elections.
According to experts, many high-ranking Republican politicians are able to defend the highest court candidate for sexual harassment charges. In particular, they may lose the support of female voters before the elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote on Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be recovered – says Grant Reeher, a politician at Maxwell School at the University of Sicily, said in a Saturday article on The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation by the Senator Jeff Flake Republican Arizona at the last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Prime Minister and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, Washington, D.C., on Friday.
According to Mickey’s report, on Friday morning, some protestors in the Senate’s corridor scandaled it, “It is due to the November, because despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford’s testimony, the Republican Audit Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“It will make a huge difference to democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Some people say it’s already been very high, and that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the unsafe female voters and young people (18-29 years of age) who, although not excited for the president, often fail to vote.
The analysts have already assumed to be able to attack the Republicans before Ford's public confession, if they continue to stand up for the nomination of Mr Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described the details in his statement why he accused the Supreme Court of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong in an innovative soil,” the NBC News said at the beginning of last week, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee.
“This is not only about the Commission’s vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also as the Republicans handled the case, and as Ford was acting with,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. director of the United States of America for the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite divided into considering Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony.
On the basis of a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents fully or more believed in Ford's testimony, and 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh was likely or sure to lie in his testimony, while only 30% of Ford believed it.
The FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with Kavanaugh's other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez's claims, says Guardian.
Ford, a week ago, under oath before the Senate Committee on Justice, said he was bullied by Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her sex organs at a party in the 1980s when they both studied in Yale.
The inventor of the world network will launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solidra.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the intention behind Inrupt was \"to gain control over the world\".
“We have to do it now,” he said.
It's a historic moment.
With Solid technology, the application allows people to create their own “personal online database” and also “POD”.
This may include lists, action lists, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time.
In the personal online database, it is unique that the user can decide entirely who can access the data.
The company calls it “the exercise of the right to self-determination over personal data”
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company’s task was to ensure resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contract developers involved in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers in the world can create their own decentralized applications using devices available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not ask “Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that would bring full change, which would put the business models of companies on top of the head all day.
“We do not ask for permission from them.”
In the journal Berners-Lee published on the Medium on Saturday, he wrote that Inrupt’s transmission of commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network of Solidra.
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Technical University.
Berners-Lee has been an important opinion in recent months in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I am an optimist of the next era of the world network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann Viktória-Christian First World War
The only Viktória-Christian is celebrated by an English pastor 100 years after he performed his heroine in the First World War.
Bernard Vann deserved the award during the invasion of Bellenglis and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he never knew he deserved the highest honor of British armed forces.
The two grandchildren of the memorial for his honor took him down at the Saturday ceremony in Northamptonshire County Rushden.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolicly important,” that the memorial was given exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gazette, Bernard Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his flag through the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal, a dense fog, and a heavy cannon and machine gun fire.
Later, the archline was in a hurry, and “with exceptional heroism,” the flag was on top of the flag, and then one of the two members of the camper was killed.
Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach what my grandfather did, and it taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72 years old.
After the march led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also broken the monument.
Michael Vann said that he felt honored that he could play a role at the ceremony and added: “The vision of a true hero is proven to be how many people will later express their respect.
The MMA fans were all over the night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast instead of Peppa Malaco.
Imagine that you spent all night looking at the exciting Bellator 206, and this broadcast is missing.
The San José show featured 13 battles, six of which were broadcast in the United Kingdom as part of the main competition show, on Channel 5.
In the morning at 6 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, England's viewers were not surprised by Peppa Malac instead of the match.
Many people have made it difficult for them to stay up until dawn due to the collision.
Instead of the MMA match, one of the fans “a kind of sick joke,” said on Twitter.
According to state law, such content may no longer be transmitted at 6 a.m. in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes, said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of the Department of Communications and Marketing of Bellator, on the issue.
- Yes, it's Peppa, the time of the pig.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, promised that in the future, the program would be redesigned to take account of the UK viewers.
“I think we can solve this by repeating it,” Coker said.
However, since it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is already Monday, we can't cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was switched on, there were a lot of messages, and the majority were not very friendly.
We first thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that wasn't what we were talking about, it was a legal problem.
But I promise you, this will not happen the next time.
Instead of the six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we really wanted to make the viewers happy, but we have counted ourselves.
“It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with minority complex
Tom Daley said that in his young age he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but this led the motivation to succeed.
According to a 24-year-old athlete, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the director that he had the rights of gays to give others a \"reward\".
He added that since he became a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
The long-lasting show director Kirsty Young, has been missing several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, \"as a shipwrecker,\" Daley said that as a young person, he felt less than anyone else, because \"cooperatively he was not accepted if someone loved boys and girls, too.\"
He said: “To this day, the sense of inferiority and others is the feeling of keeping me and the strength to achieve my success.
He wanted to prove that he was also “thing,” not to disappoint everyone when light turns out to be sexual.
The two-legged Olympic bronze machine became a public representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of its role in this year’s national community games in Australia, asked the world’s governments to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he was talking about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and that he would have wanted to give others a “reveal.”
The three-time world champion said that “the situation was completely surprised,” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, who first met him in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning scriptwriter married last year and claimed that age difference never meant a problem among them.
“If you go through so much in a young age,” he said, “he was on his first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died three years later in cancer,” he found, in his own age, a person who had experienced extreme experiences as well.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. According to Daley's own statement, it completely turned his attitude to the world.
“If you ask me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win my gold medal,” he said.
Do you know what I've learned? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal?
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie,
The child's name was Robert after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father didn't want to accept that he would die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already on the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I had no reason to say to him, ‘Father, you will no longer be there in the first row,’ he said.
“I turned his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment, I couldn’t accept that my father was not vulnerable,” he said.
The next year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and got the bronze medal.
“I was excited that this is what I dreamt of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Büszke) helped him in the preparation of the Olympics, and until today he will be slippery when he hears.
The Desert Island Disc starts on Sunday, local time at 11:15 on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on a small bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson can record the 47th Cup game on the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays a record for 12 times a year at the event held every two years, but Jim Furyk's team captain sent him to the team.
Instead of having five winners in the major competitions at the heart of events, as many times as they had to fight for the victory of the United States, one day the team is suffocating, the other half is practicing on the track and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken its game.
At the top of his career, he never belonged to the most accurate batters, so the 48-year-old player has not really had the narrow track of Le Golf National, where the high grass has to pay a very high price for the flawed blows.
And if the track itself was not quite scary, Mickelson will face the exact Frenchco Molinari English champions on Sunday, who won all four matches in the start-up Tommy Fleetwood team this week.
If the Americans with a four-point background start hard before the 12 individual matches, the game of Mickelson can be of crucial importance.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else could he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in the development of today’s day. He beat my back, scratched me, and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He's extremely confident.
It's one of the biggest, and it's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I didn't mean to play two games.
I planned more, but in the given situation, we decided to make it the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else.
With Mickelson's Sunday role, Nick Faldo's record will be over, and no one has ever played any more games on Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series of Ryder Cups that are far from the performance of the player individually.
Mickelson’s 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven independents, however, Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player has no tangible benefits for the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, spiritous, he loves to joke with the rest, a great team member,” he said.
“I think younger players also enjoyed playing games against him and it’s good to see it.
His presence is beyond the strict sense of the game.
Thomas Bjørn, Captain of the European Team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on Ryder Cup's last day of individual matches, you can easily turn your back on him.
The Danish player first appeared in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end of the day they managed to keep a hair-pressed advantage for the victory of the 141-2-31-2 ratios.
“We must always remind ourselves that we have made a huge advantage in Valderrama, but we have won only one hairline, and we have also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out of it,” Bjørn said in the picture following the 2018 class 5-3 Friday and yesterday’s victory, leading to 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“We think of competitions in the past few years, and everyone can see that the game is not over.
You have to play full power tomorrow.
So come on, and do all you need to win.
We can't relax until the dots get on the table.
We have our goal, which is nothing but to win this trophy, and now we only have to focus on that.
As I said before, I am most concerned with the 12 players of our team, but we also need to pay attention to the other side, who are, in fact, one of the biggest players in the world.
Bjørn said: “I would like to make predictions in such a situation.
The day of tomorrow is different.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team games.
It's a great feeling to play in a couple when things go well, but when a person stands individually, it turns out in every way what a golfer really is.
This must be understood by the players to bring the best out of the field tomorrow.
They must be separated from their companions, who will also have to make the best form.
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team, is specifically confident that his players perform more individually than in a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
According to Furyk, both sides of the last-day resurrections have already been experienced: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then on the losing side he stood as a miracle for the European team “Medinah” after his outstanding bravour performance.
“I remember all the damn words,” he said when he was asked because he encouraged the players before the last day by Ben Crenshaw’s team captain in 1999.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we’re doing the best we can in Brookline, as we can see in Medinah.
If one of the teams is really getting better, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle games.
So we set the order and set up our players to do a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas got the job to stand at the forefront of the efforts to reverse the job, and Roy McIlroy is playing against the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are following the first half of the European team.
“I also decided on the order, because I believe that this is how the picture is assembled from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual attitude.
Once again, Germany's latest warship has been postponed
The latest fregate of the German Navy in 2014 should have been served to replace the early Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for you for the next year.
The flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the “Rheinland-Pfalz” was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the Diet Zeit weekly, quoted as one of the military spokespersons.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made it very difficult for the major project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg ships to replace the Bremen-class fregates.
We know that it will be equipped with high-fired cannons and rockets against various aircraft and water vehicles, including a signal-reflecting device that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signs of the ship.
Another important feature is that you need maintenance less often, which in practice means that these latest fregates can be placed in service for up to two years away from the mother-in-laws.
However, due to the continuing slip of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, will become obsolete when they are finally in service, said Die Zeit.
The heavy fate F125 was released last year, when the German Navy officially refused to open the vehicle and sent it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
The reasons for the return were not much information that came to light, but the German media has a number of critical “soft and hardware errors” that make the warship unusable in a combat mission.
Software shortages are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will be served on Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which is only half of the crew of old Brémia-class frigates.
It is also clear that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7,000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are believed to be twice as difficult as the ships of the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from faulty components, the increase in the overall cost of the project, including training the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) while the initial plan was estimated at EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warning that Germany's marine presence is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, President of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently admitted that the Navy “has begun to run out of the in-house warships.”
In the meantime, the problem has become a self-expressive process, as the old ships had to be installed, but there are no more ships to replace the fallouts.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust seeks the secret life of the bats
New research is being conducted on a Scottish-wide property, which aims to find out how bats use the landscape characteristics while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single-air mammals, which can also benefit from future racial protection initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behavior of ordinary and soprano dwarf brothers, as well as brown long-floored bats and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the appropriate points of the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will make mobile data collection with manual detectors.
In a detailed analysis of the sound material of the recordings, the frequency of the convulsive sounds can be determined, and which species does exactly what they are doing.
Researchers also produce a habitat map and report, which allows you to define in detail how animal behavior depends on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS natural counsellor, hopes that the results will reveal what are the most important habitats for bats, and what species will use them.
This information will help determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the development of layers, and how forest areas can best be preserved for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of the bat populations has decreased significantly over the past century.
Buildings and spatial development work disrupt animal sleeping sites and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as well as for installed leopards, certain chemical procedures used for construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, because of their night predators, they are much more dependent on hearing when they hunt for the bride, and not on their vision.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasonic resounding, they can determine the exact position of insects as well as of the field objects in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes the question of bats very seriously.
They are working with ten skilled professionals who regularly conduct studies and bedtime examinations and sometimes participate in rescue work.
The organization created the first and only dedicated denetary reserve in Scotland on the Threvebirds located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten denetary species of Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is the ideal habitat for bats.
“There in Threve, they have a great place for the bats,” he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel good.
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that there are bats living there before the renovation of buildings, since the destruction of a single establishment could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The bats of protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also requested the help of the population.
He said: “There are always many things we don’t know about bats, and there’s almost no information about the situation of the population of most domestic species.
Ronaldo denies accusations of rape, attorneys' lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, a misfortune of the charges of rape against him, said others wanted to use his name to \"take public knowledge\".
Football lawyers are ready to sue for the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Battle of Juventus was accused of rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid him $375 000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo reported a few hours after the charges were released in an Instagram Live video with 142 million fans, saying that the news was “the state.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What I’ve been involved with today is all lies,” the camera told the five-fold gold ball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public consciousness.
That's what happens.
They want to become famous with my name, such as the life of public actors.
I'm a happy man and I'm okay with my life,\" he added in a smile.
Because of the claims that “unacceptable, infringing suspicions of privacy,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer’s statement that the player’s claim for compensation will be filed, “for the moral damages caused to the extent of the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The case was reported to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man had an anal raped the woman, standing in the documents submitted to the district prosecutor of Clark County in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo was on his knees after the incident, and he told him that he was a ‘99 percent good boy,’ except for ‘one percent’.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that all this had been done in a joint agreement.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police, and at a hospital, he also made a visit to his injuries, but later went into an extra-judicial agreement, because “he was afraid of the infringing, as well as of “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to confuse her life.
Ronaldo stood at the time of the alleged attack before the transfer (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer the giant in Italy, Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will treat you forever – the loss of car factories
“The United Kingdom will treat you forever,” said Greg Clark, Minister of Business, if you lose your world leader’s position after Brexit.
He added: \"It's worrying,\" he said, \"the Toyota UK, according to which, if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at the factory near Derby.
“We need the deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, in the case of a non-contractual Brexit, workplaces may be lost due to delays at the border.
Toyota Auris and Avens were manufactured by a factory unit of 180,000 cars last year, which exported 90% of them to the rest of the European Union.
“I see that if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, it will take production positions in the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnastani.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also expressed concern about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that after Brexit, he would close Minik’s factory in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that in the case of a non-contractual Brexit there are risks in relation to the supply chain.
Toyota’s production line operates on a timely basis, with components coming from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, border disruptions may lead to delays in production and a lack of part of production according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough spare parts in Derbyshire for more than a day, so it should be stopped production.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was set up to avoid delays at the border.
“We have a need for a deal. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions that we can not only enjoy the fruit of our current success, but also that would offer new opportunities,” said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we need to keep our supply chain that is currently very successful.
Toyota could not tell how long the production would last, but warned that the cost of the company could be undermined in the long run by the competitiveness of the factory, which could ultimately result in the loss of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked 24 years at the Burnostoni plant and is currently active in the representation of the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that we will never get back to jobs that have ceased at this time.”
One government spokesman said: “We have developed a strong and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, said the White House
“You can postpone a week,” Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, Donald Trump, said on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's special prosecutor, who investigates the Russian influence on elections, any relations between Trump's advisors and the Russian government, or any obstacle to the justice of Trump.
In Washington, for months, Trump has found that he eventually loses the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence.
According to the New York Times e month’s announcement, Rosenstein considered that he would come to the meeting to confirm the conversation with the president and the question was also asked whether, on the basis of the 25th Amendment, Trump could be replaced.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the speech was to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, whose presence was in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said, “I’m not happy,” he would go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn’t be in conflict with the Senate’s judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, also witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which continued to be postponed by the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has visited Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: “We have no designated date yet, or we can set it up for this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I see another one-week delay.
I'll soon find out, and as always, I'll notify the press.
Some journalists, however, doubted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked about this.
Sanders replied that the reason for the rareness of press reporters was not the opposite of the behavior of television reporters, but added: “I don’t argue with the fact that it is really sensational.
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the representatives of the press will take place more often.
“The president has given me more questions than any former president,” he said. He added, even without supporting the statement, “We have been looking at the numbers.”
Press spokespersons will continue, Sanders said, “If the press has the opportunity to put their questions directly to the President of the United States, the light years are better than they would talk to me.
We often try to find a series of events, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so you can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House Press Press spokespersons.
Trump will regularly answer reporters’ questions when leaving the White House or public events, possibly participating in press conferences with visiting dignity.
Press conferences alone are very rare.
Why, it may be possible to conclude that what happened this week when the president, in New York, made a bizarre role in front of the assembled journalists.
The Head of the Healthcare Stock Exchange sent a letter to the employees of the European Union of NHS Scotland due to concerns about Brexit
The head of the health wallet expressed appreciation of the country in a letter to the employees from the countries of the European Union in Scotland, and highlighted that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected exit of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs related to the application for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter to Freeman, he wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued, as a result of which a decision is expected to be taken in the autumn.
The UK Government has also agreed to prepare a scenario without any agreement.
I know what a refreshing time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Staff from different EU countries and from other countries will help with valuable experience and expertise in the work of the health wallet, which will have a positive impact on patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we would very much like them to stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie was in urgent surgery after a head injury.
Tenssee State Tigers' linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, performed an emergency operation after having suffered a major injury in the 31-27 battle against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reported Mike Organ Tennessee.
The Head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He walked out to the coastline, and he just fell apart,” Reed said.
The training team and the members of the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track and then put it on a barrel and took it for further investigations.
One of Tennessee State's competent authorities in Nashville, Tennessee, said Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie is beyond the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “You don’t know more about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie spends the first season of a year restful second-year student in the Tenssee State team to which he was transferred from Illinois.
A total of five successful installations were introduced on Saturday before leaving the track, so it was already 18 in the season.
Foreign customers will have to pay a higher fee for the property purchased in the UK
Based on the new plan of Toryk, foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees after the properties purchased in the UK, and with the addition of the proceeds, they would support homeless people.
By this step, I would neutralize the success of Corbyn among young voters
The increase in taxes is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the State Treasury’s calculations, this would amount to 120 million euros per year, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee after the property purchased in the United Kingdom, and the resulting extra revenue will be used to support homeless people and will be announced at Theresa May’s press conference today.
The aim of this step is probably to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he has achieved by promising more affordable housing and measures aimed at high incomes.
The increase of the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the UK, and the additional revenue will be translated into the fight against homelessness.
The additional charge that is added to the current levy, which can be calculated over the higher tax on the second apartments two years ago and the property purchased for expenditure, or up to three per cent.
The State Treasury is expected to generate 120 million pounds per year as a result of the measure.
According to estimates, 13% of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens, resulting in a significant price rise, which makes the situation of the first apartment buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich districts of the country became “soul cities,” especially in the capital, as many foreign customers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees to help young people who were waiting for their first home.
According to him, the construction industry holds large companies responsible for maintaining high real estate prices, which have become a habit of buying and leaving the areas on the parlagon. May was asked to cancel the quotas for affordable houses and to begin with something in the country’s “restriction of the housing market.”
Corbyn has also presented remarkable proposals for the series of housing reforms, including the elimination of housing control and basic care-free housing.
In addition, it would provide the councils with more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said, “I said that I wanted to devote my Prime Minister to restoring the English dream and that life would be better for every generation.
To do this, the real estate market situation should be resolved.
Britain remains open, as always, to those who want to live, work and establish a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals outside the country as well as companies with foreign interest can easily buy properties as hard-working English citizens.
Dreams from their own home have become almost untapped for too many, and the impeccable condition of homelessness has become too accessible.
Jack Ross: “I want to be the chief manager of the Scottish team.
Jack Ross, said Sunderland’s coach, “the greatest desire,” was to be the manager of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take up the challenges of the North-East Club, which is currently in the third place of the first-class league, with only three points remaining from the first position.
He then moved his seat to the Stadium of Light after he successfully returned his team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play as a friend for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserve,” Ross said in his Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I looked at a lot of games from the Scottish team in Hamburg with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now I only have the chance to succeed as a club manager.
Among Ross's predecessors of the Sunderland Manager is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not excited about the need to enter such great names and has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town’s offer.
“At this moment, I’m going to measure whether I can get the team back to the first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it will undoubtedly be the place in the first class league,” he said.
“It will not be easy to get back, but more than likely that I will only consider my activities to be successful if I succeed in returning to the club.”
Ross’s management career began just three years ago after he served as an assistant coach at Dumbarton’s team and spent 15 months at the Hearts Coach Guard.
After that, Aolla was helped to stand on foot after the team fell back to the third class, and St. Mirren and St. Mirren got the title in the next season.
Ross claims that he feels much more confident now than in his gaming career, like Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, or Hamilton Academy.
“It was a great moment,” he quoted the time spent as a coach of Alloa.
“I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
It sounds strange, because I did well, I had a very good life of it, and I had a few really memorable moments.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
A lot of things have to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks are for me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I'm feeling the best in my skin in my entire adult age.
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel from 12:00 to 13:00 on the Sunday show in Sportsound, September 30, and local time.
According to a study, the beer is best at 5:30 a.m.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of anglia pubs in difficulty increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under very pressure.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “In July, the trend of the previous month led to a decrease in revenue growth of 2.8%, apart from the fact that the restaurants could be seen more than a decrease in the number of restaurants.
The reduction in the revenue of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Mostly sold pubs and bars were the best ones who produced more growth than even the fall in restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also uncomfortable with the long-term sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people prefer to drink at this time.
The revenue of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, and food revenue fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results follow the trend that has been drawing since the end of April.
The weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult position and the annual income loss of 4.8% may become particularly painful due to constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for the long, hot summer for the operators, and it will only be time to find out whether the slower weather in August will also bring relief in this area.
The total revenue increase in pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slow pace of introducing new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which focuses on the sales of the UK hospitality sector (Pubs, Bars and Restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry focus, collects and analyses performance data from an operator group of over 9 billion important totals of 47 members.
Five out of five children have social media fictions hidden from their parents.
A survey found that five out of five children have (even at 11 years of age) with social media fictions that are hidden from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta pages” increases
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students responded to having an account that their parents can see.
Five out of five children create social media accounts that are hidden from adults (even at 11 years of age).
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta portfolios” refers to the Instagram photo-sharing page.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students replied that they have an unmagulated “head” account that their parents can see, but also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager's profile on which she stood to \"sacrificate.\"
According to a study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and independent school directors and directors, Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) have 40% of 11-18 years of age with two profiles and 50% admitted that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC chief Mike Buchanan.
Eilith Doyle will be the voice of the “sporters” in the Scottish Association of Atlétics
Eilith Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Atlétic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Ian Beattie, the president of the board, said it will be an invaluable help to the decision makers of the sport over the past decade.
“Eilidh is led by a huge appreciation in Scotland, the UK and the international athelitic community, and its presence will help the development of Scotland’s Atlétics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, “I have agreed to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can truly help the work of Scottish athletes.”
Two of four Olympic gold medals on the BBC as a regular expert were made at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but due to a temporary brain circulation disorder, they were forced into a wheelchair.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it would take time to see if I'd come back.
With a man's trying work, but I managed to completely recover, I can walk again, I'm going to agility training today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages.
Breast cancer similar to cows divides the online community
Heves brought an online dispute with a breast-feeding company, which compared nursing mothers to the scalp.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first quiet, portable breast-catcher,” and the appearance of their product was advertised in a musical video, ironic advertising, which showed the freedom to give the mothers of their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stand full of straw, while in the background they can hear the following lines: “Yes, I know, I have no tail, and “if I hadn’t noticed, these are not beads, but my breasts.”
And the reflex sounds like, \"I'm pumping, pumping the child to eat big, pumping, pumping, I'm going to head the girls.\"
The advertising published on the Facebook page of the company soon became a crucifixion of online disputes.
The video has reached 77 000 views and received hundreds of comments from a mixed reception. Many people believe that the advertising gút fires from the dairy industry’s “bourgeoisities”
“To promote the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth, but their wines are lost within days,” reminds one of the speakers.
The Elvie bra can be placed discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother )
In another comment, “Yes, it’s terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast-feeding to mothers who can keep their children?
Someone else added: “A completely unsensible advertisement”
Others came to protect advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “very funny”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would've bought it if I had breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a stupid commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it again.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who have milk in their workplace or in a toilet who feel like a “tehene” for this reason.
It does not praise or judge the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, women show that during the dance they had the discrete bra in their bra.
The campaign is building on the feeling that women who use breast-feeding sometimes feel cowy.
Elvie Pump is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communication director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, therefore it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative manner.
By pointing to the parallel between women with milk and scalps, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges the use of nipples is facing, and to make it funny to see what freedom our nipple gives in comparison with that.
Elvie's bra didn't get into the news for the first time.
On the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother, Marta Jakubowski, entered the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of children's migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children’s migrants in custody reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings did not change much. This can be partly explained by the fact that the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and the so far measures make it harder to find host homes for them.
Intruders tend to be illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they applied for the adoption of children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that parents and adults living with them should give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, head of the Immigrant and Customs Department, acknowledged in his testimony to Congress last week that dozens of people who had filed for the reception of minors who had arrived without a escort have been arrested.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the detainees were impeccable.
80% of immigrants and their household residents are illegally staying in the country and a significant proportion of those convicted.
That is why we continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of their detention rather than 60 days before the court, the social workers claim.
Many people are enrolled in the court through videoconferencing calls instead of the personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not give legal protection, the immigrant will be quickly removed.
Over the past few months, social workers and workers in the system reported that the longer the arrest takes place, the more nervous and depressive children, and the increased chances of violent eruptions or escape attempts.
According to law enforcement, these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to their gyms, where it is difficult to filter those in need of psychological care due to the number of children.
They added that if they don’t provide enough time for children to prepare or say goodbye to friends before moving them to such an facility, they make them even more trauma.
Syria has called for immediate departure of the American, French and Turkish invasion forces.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the General Assembly of the United Nations, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country for eight years.
Moualem, the Deputy Prime Minister, also said that foreign forces were illegally entering the Syrian territory on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and will be treated as \"as well\".
“They have to withdraw without any condition,” the General Assembly said.
Moualem claimed that “the war against terrorism will soon end in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He announced that Damascus “ will continue his holy struggle to clean Syria’s entire territory from terrorist groups and from “the illegal foreign presence”
The United States's 2000 soldiers are in Syria, the majority of them are trained and as consultants to help Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting the Bassár el-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and only “one Western countries” are the \"irraditional fears\", destabilizing refugees from their return.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return home,” he said.
“We have made politics from a pure humanitarian question.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition on the closure of the war.
According to United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a conflict zone in the last great wake of the rebels, around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians to launch a wide-ranging attack on the three million population.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement \"light deadlines\" were defined and indicated that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including the an-Nustra Front linked to Al-Kaiida, which must be \"extracted\".
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee consisting of representatives of the government and opposition will be convened soon to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare elections.
Moualem considers that the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, such as the revision of some articles of the current Constitution, is acceptable and that it protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trumpot will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless there are a number of liberal viewers' hopes, and a re-election procedure or a scandal will not end its presidency before the time.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential final of all time.”
However, viewers still enjoy the show.
Since 2014, almost doubled, the CNN’s main schedule views increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen’s data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main series instead of 1.7 million people four years ago, and the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, and the most visited cable show with its 3.5 million audiences, which is achieved on the nights of the major news.
“It attracts us like a fire, because something we didn’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series ABC-A-Desperate Survivor, in this series. In this series, the office has a low-ranking miniature sitting in the president’s chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.

As a result, a Boston taxi before the 2016 election:
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why,” said Scovell.
“Because he laughed,” the driver replied.
This is the entertainment of chaos.
In contrast to television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to Roe vs. Wade-precedents, whether they can reunite immigrant families and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very narrow layer can you not care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsibility for information when we have been watching a series of debates in which the credibility of the anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward’s book, or Paul Manafort’s $15 thousand striker jackets, according to the wording of The Washington Post, or the results of the description of Stormy Daniels Trump, anatomy, anatomy.
From now on, I will always think of Super Mario.
“It’s a little bit like looking at a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, author of the “School Stars.” In Trump’s show, the actors constantly exchange, and the new turns come daily (for N.F.L., to praise Kim Dzongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll be gone immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant 26-degree, sunny time in Kauain, he still choked in his house towards MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He was unable to break off the TV as Brett Kavanaugh began hearing in the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but they seemed to be right.”

Both parties put money into the most intense competitions of the semi-age congress election
No one was surprised that, in the 17th election in Pennsylvania, both parties would spend their money uncalculatedly after two active representatives were redesigned for the same chair.
The recently redesigned district of Pittsburgh is one of the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in the past spring.
Lamb’s opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of the previous 12 districts of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today’s 17th district.
The map had to be redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found in January that the previous district borders were manipulated to the Republicans' advantage.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) were almost interlinked during the campaign.
Lamb’s name was then known in Pennsylvania that he won a large-scale inter-term election in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, his seat was for the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The United States has considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then stopped the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump was in a good mood in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varela, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called back the U.S. officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their recent decision, which says Taiwan is not supported, said earlier, Heather Nauert, the minister spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $1 140 million in US aid, including drug-related, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closing meetings continued, North and Central American competents postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal being to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It has also been announced that at the conference planned in mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to diplomats, clearly indicates how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. sent quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue a criminal statement and did not take criminal measures.
John Bolton’s White House spokesman did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by three American officials, including two diplomats.
They were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next attack may be a report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who examines whether Trump has somehow prevented justice.
Mueller’s investigation also includes whether Trump’s team has cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are in majority in Congress, they will certainly try to take responsibility for Trumpot, who, after the voters, may have to face the conviction of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as it is not for Europe's best friends.
Serious decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on how long the fight will go.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to kill Hitler, waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechs in Munich.
The support has been missed, so it has not been able to prevent the blood clot of the next few years.
It is at similar historical points that the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Today, we can identify several such turning points in America.
What are we going to do if Trump replaces Deputy Prime Minister Rod Rosenstein, Inspector of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been intrusive since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested, to record talks with the president, and to assume Trump's unauthorized office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
How will we react if the F.B.I. study launched against Brett Kavanaugh will be closed or incomplete and, despite a valid sexual harassment charge, will be appointed as a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is: are we voting for a Congress that is ready to be held accountable for Trumpot?
If we fail these trials, democracy will look in front of a long winter.
I trust that this will not happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, whom my Nazi regime deported to Auschwitz, the same regime that was once built in the building of my ambassador's home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and sixty years later asked me to light candles on a table wearing a sign of svastics during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, who plays at Rangers, is confident before the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians can guarantee them participation in the Group of the European League of G after an unforeseeable battle against the Spanish Villarreal.
The midfield Graham Dorrans was unable to go to the 2-2 game against Villarreal in the season, but he feels that building on this result, Rangers could identify the bravest goals for themselves.
“There was a great team against Villarreal,” he said.
We believed we could get a score, and we brought a point.
Maybe at the end of the day, we could've pulled another goal, but we can't complain about the undefeated.
In the first half, they were better, and in the second half we tied it to him.
Thursday will be another important European match.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their previous match, but our fans will definitely be able to get the strength behind our backs to win.
Last year was hard enough, I got hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
It's good for our team, guys enjoy the game, the workouts go well.
I hope that if we give up everything, we can leave the previous season behind us and achieve good results.
Many women are worried about not saving enough age.
Students in the survey had accurate ideas about what kind of elderly care they wanted, but only a small part of them spoke about this with their family members.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were talking about this with their children.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually pick up the subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
It is worth doing the following.
First discuss the question with your spouse and your children: You cannot expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell us in time what your needs are.
Choose together with your adviser and family where and what kind of care you want; these decisions have a significant impact on future costs.
Take in a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care, or with a hybrid savings insurance that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources for it.
Prepare the legal documentation: In advance, the possibility of further litigation will be cut.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who deals on your behalf in health matters, supervises medical care and ensures that everything happens according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with his finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure the payment of accounts when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: Let’s make sure your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing to be available at any time.
“It is not only the financial issues that need to be clarified, nor does it matter who his doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned in advance.
A man was shot several times in Ilfracom
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after his evening program.
The victim of his forty years was attacked in the part of Ilfracom to Oxford Grove in Devon. He was shot at by his chest, his abdomen and his hands.
The police described the shooting around 02:30 as a \"unconvinced act\".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and fountains in Indonesia
At least 384, they lost their lives when a large earthquake on Friday, and then a fountain hit the city of Palu in Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims may continue to grow.
The communication network of the region was also damaged, so there was no news from the government of Dongbal, north of Palu, where it was the center of an earthquake of 7.5.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important data about Palu and Donggala on Celebes Island:
The capital of Palu Central-Celebes Province, on the western coast of Celebes Island, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the city when the earthquake and the fountain hit him.
The Donggala government stretches over 300 km on the northwestern coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the government, less than the province, was approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Central-Celebeszre is primarily a characteristic of fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is one of the most important sectors of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit several times in the past 100 years.
One in 1938 escaped with more than 200 residents and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Western Donggala was reached by a fugitive, nine died.
Indonesia is located in the region of the geologically active Pacific Fire Ring, which is why earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and fountains of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea earthquake began on the west coast of the province of Aceh, which launched a fountain reaching 14 countries, which required a total of 226 000 lives along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong reefs shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
hundreds of people died near the island of Nias.
2006: One of the 68 strong vibrations shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s largest population island, and the resulting fountain required almost 700 victims on the southern coast.
2009: 7-6 earthquakes destroyed by Padang, near the capital of the province of Western Somalia.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: 7.5-strong vibrations shook one of the islands of the Mentawa Island group near Sumatatra, and brought about 10 meters of fountains that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: The panic and destruction of Aceh Pidie Jaya was a great reminder of the memories of the 2004 terrible fountain.
This time, the root price did not exist, but more than 100 residents found their deaths under the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombards among tourists popular Indonesian island; a large-scale vibration here required 500 lives, especially in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the earth, and thousands of tourists are stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, former Deputy Governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin lives in the Alaskan Wasilla and suspects that he committed domestic violence, prevented domestic violence, and opposed arrest, said the Alaskan State Police.
Police report says when a lady's officer wanted to call the police to report alleged crime, he took the woman's phone.
Palin is held in the Mat-Su Prison in advance for the arrest, and he's issued a $500 bail, said KTUU.
On Saturday he appeared before the court, and he answered the question of his guilt, “There is no guilt at all.”
Palin is accused of three Class A infringements, i.e. four years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

His mother Sarah Palin reported an alleged attack on the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veteran Tribunal.

An earthquake of 7.5, which destroyed thousands of residential houses.

Federal prosecutors asked for a death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack on eight lives in New York City.
Saipov, 30-year-old, accused of driving a truck rented from Home Depot in October on the streets of Also-Manhattan West Side Highway, ran a number of pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov was committed to killing eight of his victims, and “has been guilty of injury,” he is in the New York South District prosecutor’s office.
According to the document submitted, any evidence of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was accused of 22 crimes, including a murder for eight-order blackmail, almost exclusively used against organised crime, and destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for significant planning and predisposed intention, according to the prosecutors, and Saipov said he had done his work in a “serious, cruel, inhumane way.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District of New York has recently asked for a death penalty for a defendant.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to a life sentence.
In the New York Federal case, the last death sentence was executed in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not prove any harm in the days and months following the attack.
During the hearings, he said he was happy to have spent his work.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of attacking, standing on the charges.
The police said they wanted to put out an ISIS charger in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovo, said that “they were clearly disappointed,” due to the decision of prosecutors.
“It is our belief that the real life-consuming loss of life, which was imposed for a confession, would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only prolong the sufferings of all the players involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders have previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
According to a representative of Tory, NIGEL FAAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
At a demonstration held at the Tory Conference, Mr Farage declared that “he calls the army of the people into battle.”
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians should feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics after one of the parties in Theresa May called on Farage to entrust negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not complete any office, told the participants of the Birmingham Assembly that the United Kingdom “has already left the country” had Farage been Minister of Brexit.
It is well characterized by the pressure on May's hard-working party that the remains of Toryk were talking about another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers Plan, which requires permanent licensing between Brexit and survival parties and the EU.
In spite of the negative reactions, his allies are trying to reach agreement with Brussels, so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only be selected from their package or the “full chaos”.
Bone in Solihull’s Leave Means Leave (Expression means we’re leaving,” he said in a protest that we need to count off the “Chequers-alku –
He proposed that Farage be brought into the House of Lords and that negotiations with Brussels be entrusted to him.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have left,” he said.
He added: “I hold on to Brexit, but I have to count on Chequers.
“We did not fight in World Wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.
Bone rejected the assumption that the public has changed since the vote in 2016: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to remain.
Andrea Jenkyns, a representative of the Brexit Party, also attended the meeting, and said to reporters: “I ask you to do so: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers wave rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, is popular, and especially amongst the activists who work on the field, and they helped us get to the government.
Forget about Chequers and listen to us.
May added: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his chair, who keeps his word.
Farage said at the assembly that politicians should “hear the pressure” so as not to dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between the people and our politicians is now the stake,” he said.
They want to sell Brexit, and today we gathered together to send it, we will not allow it to be done.
With these words he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I would love to see our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit feel the pressure.
We call on the people's army to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.
At the same time, the remaining parties were drawn up in Birmingham, and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists founded the weekend, \"Toryk against Brexit,\" the flag of the movement.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party was on conservatives due to security errors at the opening of the conference for the purpose of the party.
“These people have said that they have an IT background for an agreement on a Canadian plus plus, without a border crossing and a free trade agreement with Ireland,” he added.
They're just talking to me.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came closer to the world championship after he won the victory before Sebastian Vettel, thanks to his team orders.
Once Valttter Botts qualified himself in a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the Mercedes team' instructions will play a major role in the race.
The non-positioning Bottas started well and nearly got into trouble with Hamilton, as the first two around protected his position, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
He first stood in the box with Vettel, and allowed Hamilton to be stuck behind the middle field, which should have proved decisive.
Mercedes stood a circle later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a close action, during which Ferrari's pilot left the interior free after having moved twice as a defense in the third heel.
Max Verstappen, who celebrates his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the slopes, and by the end of the first round was the seventh.
He then led most of the race, since he did not exchange their tires to reach the goal quickly and prevent Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, he stood in the box around 44th round, but the remaining eight circles could not increase his pace, so he became Räikkönené's fourth place.
“It was a good day, because Valtter was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to let me go.
The team had an exceptional job to get the first two seats,” Hamilton said.
His body was very bad.
President Donald Trump exonerated Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, as the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasay Ford's letter, which accused Brittany of sexual harassment of a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony, which he made before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but merely noted, the things in the Senate prove that people are \"creeds, haters and liars\".
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate when they see anger when they see people angry, beards, haters and liars,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, let's stop for a second.
We leaked?...no, we didn't leak,” he said, imitation of the senator.
He sent a letter to Feinstein and leaked the letter at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein denied that the source of leaking was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill’s report.
“He asked me to handle it confidentially, and I also handled it confidentially in accordance with his request.
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the President, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what the situation was: his body speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn’t leak it, but it was the worst body talk I’ve ever seen.
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, that Democrats were using alleged charges for their own purposes.
“They decided to have any means, but they will regain power.
You can see the belief, the hatred, they don’t care who they are being abused, who they need to cross to gain power and control,” the president quoted the words of Mediaite.

The air controller lost his life to save hundreds of people on the plane from the earthquake.
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely fly.
More than eight hundred died, and many disappeared after the island of Celebesz was shocked by a significant earthquake on Friday, which led to an attack by a fountain.
There are still strong extremities in the area, and many people in the city of Palu are under the debris.
Despite the fact that their colleagues have fled their lives, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the floating control tower of the Bulk Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It was left to allow Batik Air flight 6321 to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirai, the decision could save hundreds of lives, reported the case with Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palico.
“Our heart has increased when we heard the news,” he said.
While the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can be thousands, according to the state's disaster response organization, the city of Donggaala, Sigi and Boutong is difficult to approach.
“The number of victims is likely to continue to grow, as many people were hiding under the Roma, and many were unable to achieve it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves reaching the height of six meters destroyed Palut, where a massive funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver assistance and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
Few of the clean water.
The small stores are all over the world.
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross tries to help survivors through competition, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
This is a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, arrived on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers to: “I ask you to work on the mission of evacuation every night!
They are ready to report CNN.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in the island of Lombards, in which more than five hundred and fifty died.
Microness: According to Air Niugini, a person has disappeared in a flight accident in the lagoon.
According to the latest announcement by a airline operating a plane crash in Micronesia, the Pacific lagoon, a person disappeared, although it was previously claimed that the evacuation of all 47 passengers and personnel was successful from the flying plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, a man can't count a man's passenger on Sunday afternoon.
According to the airline, they work with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer any further information about the passenger, such as questions about his or her age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and staff after flying into the air while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were transported to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of misfortune and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing trail.
According to some witnesses, the plane took away the landing path.
A U.S. passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed very low.
“This is a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that with others, he was able to gas in the water until the crash of the flying plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, ships that repaired a rocket were also helped in rescue and carried people off the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane exploded under the water color of 30 metres.
Based on the data of the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in the past two decades, but none of them were affected by Air Niugini.
It's amazing to put together the events of the night when a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the accused at the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been a witness for hours as an information analysis expert.
He met the jury about how he put together the cell phone records with the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
According to Rowlett, he received multiple phone data, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicts the previous claims of the man, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police asked Sanford.
Sanford made a statement on Saturday that said he wasn’t in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was “shading,” because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Based on the cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
“He wiped him out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to start its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge says the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.

The New York Dad has been suing a party after a \"rassist\" message
A New Yorkian dajka lawsuit was launched because of the dismissal of a couple of discriminations after he was mistakenly sent to him in a message, the mother complained that “we’ve already applied a black-and-dog once again.
The couple denies being racists and comparing it to “sacrifice.”
The mother of the two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when she saw her first working day when the new child caretaker Giselle Maurice arrived in 2016.
“I don’t care what you think,” said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to your husband.
But instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after waking up, Plasco-Flaxman, who was “unfortunately,” fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing dog who was afro-American did a bad job and rather expected a filipino.
Ms. Maurice paid her one-day job and then sent her home with a Uber.
Maurice now sues the party for compensation due to dismissal, and asks for $350 a day compensation for a six-month period of domestic work to which it was originally hired, even though without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the journey, that can’t be done,” he told Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism that the abolition of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that they would not trust him after they had been violated.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone who, if you accidentally, had a bad time?
Your newborn?
Come on, come on.
According to Plasco, his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago, and “he was in a very difficult situation.”
\"Do you think someone would attack such a thing?
It’s not really nice to do that,” added the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the public opinion court has already quickly condemned the party in social media, harming their behavior and logic.
According to a letter that was found now, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to bind to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “There is a person who first reads himself before publishing.
It’s quite fun to see this information now when we know what a huge success on the Paddington –
He said that his father, who worked as a BBC operator before being inspired to write a child book from a little toy mask, would not have been troubled if his work had been rejected, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the book was in the middle of his father’s death last year.
Paddington “a very important member of their family,” he added, his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he had no idea at all,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who brought something to him: we are proud of him even if we are not really worthy of him.
I think that's how Pgypton's success was seen.
Although he created it and fled from his imagination, he always deserved success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
At the time of landing with his daughter, Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for their lives.
“They called regularly to tell you that he was in a very bad state and that he was not expected to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperous said.
“Then I received a call from Nad, in which he told me that my daughter will die in the next two minutes and I must thank him.
Thank you.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep throwing his heart down, slowly passed away, and then left his body.
He died a long time ago, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there waiting for everything to end.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn’t leave myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, when his daughter was mourning, he entered the plane with the others who didn't care about the attempt he was just passing through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I leaned my head, and all the time I had tears.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overselling sympathy for them.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
A postcard with nursing women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent them, others do not throw away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up postcards filled with inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a wall bridge.
His son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same thing I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and he was stuck with everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that his smile would throw up any place.
But he gave up his work before his death, because he was “in a very bad state”
Tyler was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was very worried that this would have some dominance.”
Ms. David made postcards for the purpose of knowing that there are people who can be searched for and spoken to them, even if it is just a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a girlfriend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was a partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely under him on Christmas day: when the children opened up their gifts, he didn’t look in their eyes, and that’s what they were like.
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to process: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our hearts.
But we need to continue the fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if he managed to achieve what he asked for, a limited-time investigation of limited size, perhaps we could agree,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was “falling pieces” because of the party’s indeterminateness of decision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican support the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be known for timing.
The interim election is only five weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans are not doing well, it will be much harder for them to get their people into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, and they'll be lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through that he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI announces his report?
In the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to take a decision to introduce Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean dissidents under the control of Kim
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has decreased since Kim Dzongun came into power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengs quoted the data of the Southern Confederation and said that there were 1127 dissidents in 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said that the closer border guards between North Korea and China and the human smugglers were the main causes.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of the North dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have gone through the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run towards China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents are Chinese illegal immigrants and are not accepted as refugees and often sent back by force.
Practically, the relationship between North and South still in war has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the two countries’ leaders met in Phenjan, with a focus of their discussions on the nuclear removal negotiations.
This was the historic meeting of Donald Trump between American President and Kim Dzongun in Singapore, where they agreed to further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula in large lines.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the Americans, our national security is not under attack, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm our weapons,” said Ri in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi-Histeriac-Bret Kavanaugh, said he was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
The president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brittany Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court as “historic” and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I’m afraid that if a woman behaved like this at any time, I’d call it “histeriac,” he explained, “I’d say Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the testimony that she made before the Justice Committee of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh protested against celebrities that would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasay Fordo in their teens.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he shouted, and his voice closed when he spoke of his family and his years spent in high school.
In addition, he specifically condemned the Committee's Democrats, the charges brought against him as \"grotesk and co-ordinated character murder\", with the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016, being organized by angry liberals.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh’s behavior was not suitable for his work at the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was captured against the Democrats.
“I think he has excluded himself from his statements and behaviors that he has been witnessing against the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitateed when he was asked if he would try to take Kavanaugh responsible, in case it filled the post, and if the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I tell you that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court where you are right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the Capital Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about possible decisions regarding the Payable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanigh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided the questions about whether he would copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a religious, captured person to be amongst the members of the court, and he expects us to tear from joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep it in their hands.
It's a legitimate extermination, months, and years ago, the anger has come to its surface and can't be released without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so rare, right?
“I had a great help for a woman who worked in a leadership position somewhere,” he said. “He told me that in her anger she was crying, but he developed a technique according to which she began to cry in anger, saying to her conversation partner, “You may think I’m sad because I cry.
But I'm angry.\"
And then he continued.
And I thought that was a great idea.
In part, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vibrant memories of my early work, a man-controlled office, where I once began to cry in my angry inability to cry, that an older woman at my neck, a cool manager I was always afraid of, and he took me to the staircase.
“Let them cry,” he said.
\"You don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they're upset.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congress representative of Colorado, worked with Gary Harttal on his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an off-marry agent called Monkey Business, he dropped out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he found that there was no reason why he would not go for the presidency himself.
“There wasn’t a well-considered decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the next candidate was wanted in the middle of their backs.
Someone named it \"The Whites and the Seven Matures \"
Since the campaign had been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the money, he agreed not to compete unless he collected $2 million.
He was a battle to lose.
He found out that some of his supporters gave men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought I was going to get a discount,” he said.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so wasted because of the thanks to his support people, and the frustration of collecting money and reaching the voters directly, and the anger of sexism, caused by the frustration of the system that affected him.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, the press said.
“They thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my gravestone?
“Sirt”
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening line of the trade war between the US and China was almost ear-blowing, and the battle was not even close to the end, according to experts, the break-up between countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot out the first warning at the beginning of the year, by imposing a tax on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant scenario took place this week, as the new duties already affect a $200 billion product, essentially taxing half of the goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has, in all cases, cut back, the last five to ten percent duty on a $60 billion US product.
China has agreed to cut back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not conquer in the near future.
If you want to take Washington to conquer, it would mean that you have to give the debate before demands, but the public bending to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Hsi Chin-ping, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing works well, U.S.’s trade war pressure could well come to China in the long run, as it reduces the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions in Washington or Beijing that could affect any economy in the two countries is much more serious than the observers have previously recognized,” said Aigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the New American Security Department.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek assistance in the reconstruction of a country destroyed in the war for more than seven years.
In his speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid Moallem said the state of the country was getting better.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to re-establish the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to escape from the economic measures taken by terrorism and self-determination, which affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the state of Syria would be happy to receive all the help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that countries that have not been able to accept conditional assistance or involvement that supported the uprising.
Europe has acquired Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at 16.5:10.5 in proportion to Le Gold National, outside Paris.
The U.S. has failed the sixth time in Europe and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the point 14.5 that was necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who got into the whole tournament, hit him in the water at the par-3 16 hole, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari became one of the four players who had ever achieved the 5-0 results since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was awarded 5&4 from the European team's lowest-ranking player, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against Ian Poultre, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, have become the best European winner of the tournament in all time with the 25,5 career points.
“I didn’t cry in the beginning, but today I couldn’t stop.
It was a tough one year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I’m happy to help you,” he said after the European victory of Garcia with emotions.
The stafetabot will be handed over to Jon Rahman, who won the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on Sunday 2+1.
“I feel tremendous pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
This is one of the biggest players in all time in a strange statistics who has won 14 titles, and only Jack Nicklaus will prevent it.
The U.S. team has been running all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaut, who have been playing great golf during the entire tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furyk’s team, after a disappointing result, said: “Thank you to these guys for fighting.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down in front of Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will work with our team, the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to raise your hats.
The opponent was better with us.
