Eemeli Kouki led the Hurrikaan home win in the opening - the second win for Savo Volley
After seven times in a row, the Hurricane-Loima, who was on the Messoruse League medals of men, began the season 2018-19 at home when Raision Lomum crashed on Saturday 3-0.
From Romania to Finland, Eemeli Kouki was the most effective player in Hurricane at 22 points.
There were some posts abroad, but they didn't come true, and then came the call from Loimaa.
It was quickly agreed, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen’s support for Kouka at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points in the match-specific agreement.
The win of the game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought an additional tool to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal tube is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Mähätänen was at 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley, when the team poured the Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was devastating, especially in the attack, but fortunately we got a squeezed victory.
At least I didn’t have any knowledge of the different downloads when I played against my former team, Mättänen said.
At the Flying Ball in the 3 Series of 2000-01, Antti Siltala, who started his career in 2000-01, made 12 points.
Chief coach Jukka Tuivoinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small, or tunnel in the roof all the time.
A good file was left from home.
Miro was the king, and he played a good game,” he said.
The previous season of Sillanta in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielaveden in Sammo, when he was the main coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective 14 points in Ducks.
The Star of Aka-Volley
In the period 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen has also started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Volley took the season’s opening win after he poured the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started very well from its own place.
Today there was a loss, because we had a quarter of the losses from 17-21.
There was a wilderness victory, and the fifth one came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few months ago, the most effective of the tigers in the final matches had made 28 points by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Alexanders Kudrjashovs supported at 17 points.
We didn't get much of a shot at the guy's hat, Mikkonen said.
Finland’s human capital comparison of the world’s 1st
Finland is at the top of the world’s human capital comparison, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was one of the statistics.
In 2016, the peak was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands placed one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found in Taiwan.
In 2016, the worst comparison was made between Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the education level of the population, access to education, skills and health will be examined.
The World Bank has focused on human capital in connection with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico, the local game ended naked
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into the magnificent towers, and the local game of the Madridian teams ended on the unmanned level game late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goal, but Belgian president Courtois had been fighting.
Courtois played at Atletico three times when he was playing Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation Fifa chose him as a year's goalkeeper.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal, but his shot was directed at the end of the goal's opening party.
After the break, Bale remained on the exchange because of the injury of the passenger.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the painted Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
In the United States, we are now attacking abortion law - A powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the top nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected candidate, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote could be reversed by a decision known as Roe Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is current in Finland as well.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has made public work against safe abortion and received different degrees of support from the majority of our country’s representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only medical professional in Missouri, due to legal blackmails.
An armed guard in the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos are similar to the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let’s move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Association guided women to trusted abortion physicians.
The arguments of the baptized pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of abortion itself is enough.
Deaths were in the U.S. about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortions was especially defended by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later on, in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to confuse religion with political voters in order to hug.
His abortion was also followed by his successor George Bush’s parents.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
The most profound document of the matter arises in the search for a basic reason for abortion policy.
When religious organizations in favour of racial separation were denied tax freedom, they became politically active.
He was chosen an abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots of politics.
In writing this in the U.S., we have been in a situation where a sec in his sual harassment, but the voice of religious justice on his abortion has been chosen by the President of Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh may have the authority based on the status of the language to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli Army shot seven Palestinians, amongst two children - border large protests
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year, when Israel has attacked protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in Gaza border area on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: 12 and 14-year-olds.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these animals were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw the troops of Israel with stones and explosions.
The army says that it has begun to use force, that the protesters do not break the border fence or seek it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations on the border.
According to UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12,000 have been wounded.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to be given access to areas where Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
Palestinian snipers have killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives from the Palestinian side and helium balls have lit forest areas and agricultural land in Israel.
Teemu Pukki won't be able to shoot himself.
Wigan's top couple, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have poured him in the back with a fight in the penalty area.
The Special Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tactic was pure.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was stuck in the trouble of the judge Wardia, who sentenced Norwich to the penalty kick for 85 minutes when Pukki was poured.
Ward looked like a punishment cloud, and Mario Vrancic starred at 1-0.
The Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with breast muscles.
The work was good again for Puk.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended them without feeling tired.
Norwich had a fifth match in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league.
There are five wins behind.
Pedophilic assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 experiences of interest to children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small number of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
This means about 40,000 people in Finland.
From children or young people who are sexually interested, it has been difficult to get help so far.
A joint SeriE project by the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to encounter pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in spring, the conference started in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy, and the appointment times were very quickly completed, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference to children causes shame to many.
Most of the pedophilic emotions themselves have not implemented their fantasies and thus made no criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass them and weaken them.
They also trouble normal life, says U.S. sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a special expert in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child saves sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Leaders of the Koreos or Gynecologist of Congo?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange suddenly, but Trump is one of the most popular prize winners based on betting.
Trump’s role in obtaining North Korea, at least at the level of the speeches, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
Based on the odds, the most popular of the peace of Nobel has been the South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korean leader Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming between the crowns is significant, as in the past year there were hypes.
Yet for years, the award of Kim's leading on the iron line would undoubtedly raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday the most attention is the prize of peace.
If the prize is not awarded to participants in the Korean Peninsula Diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A highly respected gynecologist has been treating thousands of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has focused his work on sexual violence, which is a devastating by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been held by the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there are 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind getting Nobel.
In May, the reporter asked him in the White House whether he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea negotiations.
There are some things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and multi-faceted world order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as a opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded by three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The award of Trump would therefore require an ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like warriors and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja was held on September 8.
The traffic of the tunnel area was cut off due to notification, both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a systemic fault, the fire department sought to make transport normal.
But it didn’t work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it could not be opened, because there are drivers on the road in the pig's socks and they drive how it happens, the emergency firefighter Pasi Kääriinen told the STT at that time.
At that time, the highway was driven in the wrong direction only after a minute of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, some others often follow, the traffic safety contact officer Tapio Heiskanen is amazed.
Under the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not be stopped as a mandatory reason.
Traffic security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, traffic cannot be compromised by uninterrupted solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be provided with the maximum degree of accessibility.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as well as making a u translation and cancelling.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, which also always need to turn on the lights.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as of course parking is also prohibited.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, Heiskanen says in the Transport Security Communication.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party, even though the ship was stuck on the lake floor.
The Ilves fans transported to Tampere would have wanted to stay on board for a winning party, even though the ship had been stuck in the lake floor, says Juho Syrja, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on the way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove off the route late on Saturday night, and remained on the ground in the Old Sea Akaka.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship were evacuated at night.
No one got hurt in friends.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party on the ship until morning, but it was certainly more reasonable to send them to the fire department on their way to the port and by bus home, Syrja said to the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK match that ended with the Ilves 4-3 win.
According to Syrvä, Saturday's buddy was due to the water surface being about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrj, navigation was also affected by the fact that the nearest sign was covered by log wastes, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark bridge.
No mention of more collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalm shortly after the ferry route had subsided the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not associated with the case according to Syrjan, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the bottom caused a more significant collision.
According to the Syrõ, catching the bottom has not caused leaks or pressure on the ship and the cruises of the ship will continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship was launched to be pulled off the masculine.
We are still on the dock to check that there was no damage, Syrja says.
Syrja believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, which is scheduled for the next weekend, can be managed.
The cruise period of the ship continues with him until the day of independence.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alarm on Saturday night after a little bit of twelve.
The port of Vienna was alarmed by ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
A friend-in-law firefighter Matti Willman told us late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and a rather harsh wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue facility announced half after three Sunday night that all ships had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cross-section built in 1957 has been preserved in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The judge of Trump, accused of hunting and drinking, may be left without a peak.
Bret Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge of the United States, may well miss the post he has sought, is evaluated by program director Mika Aaltola of the Institute of Foreign Policy.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting someone else.
In the United States, it has occurred from time to time that the candidate of the President for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of conflicts.
In that case, the judge has usually been drawn by himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The title would rain on the wall of the Democratic Camp
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain in the future elections of Congress, according to Aaltola.
It would increase voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote on Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term profit for Republicans.
It is not a chance to name every presidential term, as the judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired from their own request at about 70 to 80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans hesitate to name
The U.S. Supreme Court’s judges will normally be re-examined, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has just assigned a week to the FBI, it can still bring out something essential.
Yes, it could bring it.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s agreement or inappropriateness will still be carefully discussed before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be suspicious of the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be spent on the vote and the Republicans would lose.
The woman identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent
The Russian woman has told BBC that she recognizes Salisbury's poisoning as an agent in the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photographs, she said that it was an Anatol Tshepiga, a military intelligence worker in GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia have previously reported that they have revealed the other toxic men suspected of the Cherepiga.
They said before that they found evidence that the current male identity is a cover-up.
The BBC group traveled to Far East near the border of Russia and China to a village where Tshepiga grew.
A woman living in the village identified a young woman from the photos published by Chepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man as the British police, who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of being poisoned by former dual agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Novithok in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded an award, among other things, with the honour of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning previously told the Russian TV in September as tourists in Salisbury.
Old-fashioned waste bags in the war reform
Now there is a living example of what the change in the social reform definition of the Sipilä Government means in practice.
My birthday Vaala's social services are produced by the Oulunkaari Municipality, whose health service manager was elected to the former Regional Director of Attendo in 2016.
The leaders of the municipal group warn the delegation of the change limit.
If war spending now rises, the state aids will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a large structural change in elderly care, which would end the institution of the health centre and the unit of small memory hospitals.
Domestic care would be increased, which means that the elderly living in the remote villages are torn from their roots next to the health centre for treatment.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay it to customers.
The left of the poor did not swallow bad preparations, but organised a good public meeting with many of its own, close guests, as well as other political parties.
I presented the so-called state-of-the-art diets on how old people are treated in Vaala County at the moment at home most throughout Northern Ostrobothnia.
It was also the local council’s authorized Carina West.
The local newspaper made a big deal about the chance, and it again raised the manufacturers of the Oulunkears to their back legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, now waiting for the inhabitants to be empty.
There are no other service providers.
Graduates only talk about the service set, but don’t tell us what level of treatment it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until receiving treatment.
Without a nurse?
The facilities of the health centre will be terminated because there is no medical emergency.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of the crisis is how central officials are running the authorized data, and authorized to point their back against the wall with a limit of change.
This is how the central party will clear the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain safe to live on a voluntary basis if there is the possibility of moving away.
Is there a vote in the centre that the whole country is considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a major mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in Cologne showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the Moscow of Europe’s largest member.
Many hundreds of people had been gathered on the Rhine River beach since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the signs of protesters, and the statements condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several protests have been held, and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
In the vicinity of the major mosque, Erdogan’s supporters were also collected.
However, the police had isolated a large area of mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his German visit to Germany to be successful and assessed by strengthening its relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Colonel Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel pledged on Friday to reconstruct the relations between the countries that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, among other things, with regard to human rights issues.
Review surrounding the visit
Henriette Reker, the mayor of Cologne and Prime Minister of Nordrhein-Westphalia, canceled their participation in the opening hours when a review of Erdogan's visit was drawn.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, reported that he had come to protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that is different from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of the German trip to Erdogan in Nordrhein-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of the supplier
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people were charged with the murder of Kucia and her betrothal and other crimes.
Previously, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation this week, but five of them were released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his betrothed in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and Italian mafias.
Police have suspected the murders were linked to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
The distribution of Karelian may have problems on Sunday in the areas of distribution
Due to the error of the result, the Sunday Karjalainen will also be sent unaddressed.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in areas where the distribution to the joint boxes is subject to external memory.
The situation was the same on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Post puts extra leaf bouquets in the county.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The editor, Arto Nyberg, will be present today in his forthcoming discussion programme, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip, which she already booked on Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after an inconvenient, in 2014, and the death victim’s test flight, things are in the hole.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or not later than next year.
The number of the Vessa flight is 300, so his journey is about one year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and in a state of gravity is 5 minutes at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about the upcoming website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds himself in space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw Star Trek televisions.
Star wars have been seen, and that's what the idea of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a proud host
Manchester City continued its lossless journey in Valoliiga, when it poured off its home-field Brighton 2-0 on Saturday.
The sixth winner of the reigning master team season is Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit from the distance of the season to an empty goal when Leroy Sane found him on the back of Brighton's goal for 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling saw the peace of Brighton as a return to the 65th game.
The Argentines were able to invest 2-0 ends from the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and a single tie, the season started by City will lead Valoliiga with 19 points of catch.
One game less played by Liverpool, however, only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his seventh round match with Chelsea.
Youth clubs chose new decision makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers for the next three-year period from 2019 to 2021.
The president was elected from Anu Sivonen Ylä-Savo and vice-president of Petra Mäkeläinen Häme.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kim from Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: “Go to the very important driver.
In the interview with Blick, Mersun was asked, he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkös from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the final season.
Hamilton runs Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel at the MM points at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari said that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't believe that the Räikkönen would hit the counter.
I don't think Kim will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his ancestors.
I don't know if Kim knew this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played the F1 game at PlayStation every day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with the Russian competition.
At 14 p.m., the Mercedes Valtter Botts race starts.
The evening will follow the race for a moment.
The championship of the A-young SM series became a complete farce: the opponent arrived at only 7 players.
The top serial level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13 p.m., the starting points were clear: FC Lahti Academy is in practice enough for the first time against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn the situation in the last round, the second Ilves in the championship must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the Lahtis.
In practice, however, the Lahtian championship was confirmed even before the start of the engagement, as Vasa IFK had arrived only with the power of seven players.
If there was one less, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won 16-0.
In the distance, the Lahtians led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the football team is that the team has played in part with the same players the A-nuorte SM series, the P20 series and the Men's 2nd C-section.
Vasa IFK has played in the second in practice against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday, the Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK in a foreign match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own foreign match against KuFua in Toivala.

Supo looks forward to new ways of intelligence: equipment procurements and recruits already made abroad, there is no delay in the design of operations
According to Supon’s chief Antti Peltari, intelligence is reserved by making equipment procurements and training staff.
As the intelligence laws enter into force, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million should remain in force.
At the premises of the Defence Police (Supon) at the Helsinki Ratkasu, a full head will be prepared for the entry into force of the Intelligents.
Antti Pelttar, the Chief General of Supon, tells Western Media that equipment procurement has already been carried out for future intelligence.
Serena Williams is ashamed of the video where she sings in the upper parts - campaigning for the knowledge of breast cancer
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is dating again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself of the Australian The Divinyls.
On the video, Williams supports Australian breast cancer.
“I voted for the world hit of The Divinyls to remind women to regularly carry out self-testing,” Williams wrote in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the topic affects all women regardless of skin color anywhere in the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it will save many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at age 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
“She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to give her health priority,” Williams said.
The video has been watched 1.5 million times now.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams left Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is in the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams called on the main judge of the match, and claimed, among other things, that men would be much more exposed than women's players.
Chinese Restaurant on the mountain road is not suitable for high-rise
In addition to traditional Chinese treats, the restaurant serves great scenery.
The Chinese Zhejiang province has opened an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally a rock language.
If you want to look at the forest below.
At the heights of Jylhät landscapes, restaurant visitors will be able to break their lives in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for tourists on September 19, 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
A trip to the restaurant requires a good base, it is told about the place.
Corpel's pile run ends today: this is how everything ends.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is the case with the domestic country drama Korpela’s kuyjan race, which has been well-maintained.
The third season of production has gone like hot rocks: last week, the television was first watched by 722,000 Finns.
The top figures themselves no longer have any practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not coming forward.
In the final period of the relationship between Germany and Mirku, the real struggle will be taken again, and the mother of the Germans will think of the first thing to come.
The Anss and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, very romantic, but then the pictures appear again in Laiho.
The police are also in a suspicious position with regard to a dead man.
No one can imagine the fate of the body in advance.
You can hear the incredible news.
The last will of the long term will be revealed, which will bring a woman's tears to the brink.
After a week on Sunday and Sunday, Sorjonen continues.
I'm going to be running on TV 1 today at 21.05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work in a little flu tomorrow?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious, even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly blow, sometimes they appear in the mouse.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
Prevention says the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected for a day before the symptoms begin and proceed from five days to a week.
Children may be infected longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough hangs and there is no fever anymore, says Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast a return to the hall slows recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, put them in your nose and throw your dirty paper in the trash.
Is it painful to move?
If you have to leave your home as a sick person, consider using a protective mask.
Mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
They are also limited to the mask.
How could infections be avoided?
The best way to clean your hands is to avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, the average human touches their eyes, noses or mouths every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the mission: “My man is a ice hockey player,”
Ice hockey and mists are often combined.
This was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
In 2018, Miss Finland’s crowns have received Alina Voronkova from Pertunamaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where he moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is inkerin Finnish and her father is Russian.
The father's Russians in Voronkova were bullied at school.
Mom and Dad have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianity.
I had no friends in Pertunmaa, Alina tells the semifinalists of the Miss Finland race.
After high school, Alina decided to start at a clean table and move Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the missignauntar found new friends, and the Ark went to roll with hope.
At the age of 15, he thinks he's an adult, but after that, I really wasn't thinking.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After a career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the World Cup of 18-year-olds.
In the early days of the relationship, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later, Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got into the winner's triangle, and with it, I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we were forced to live apart, we have a good side of trust, and in remote relationships, it is a good thing that it stays above the whole time, Alina virnitist in May.
Continued growth with joy, death with our connectors
Almost everyone is concerned about the durability of the earth.
But nothing is willing to give up.
Sustainable growth is sought for sustainable alternatives, but the theory of the court economy also runs into major problems.
The constant growth of the economy has brought to ordinary people during a few generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that only could have been dreamed of.
However, the long-lasting overplaying of Earth’s profitability and climate change will make this market economy’s rock footprint a threat.

One defense mistake took us a full score, Allen complained.
We were the best again!

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran to the faculty on Lake Pyhäjärvi - “Studently closed on the rock –
The inland waterway M/S Tampere sailed to the car late on Friday night in Akaka on Pyhäjärvi.
The Rescue Department received an alarm from a water traffic accident on Friday night after half twelve.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted into a car, and is firmly attached to its neck on the rock, described the firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are transferred by bus ride to Tampere, told the emergency commander Jari Nieminen STT at one o’clock in the night.
The port of Vienna was alarmed by ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship from the Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted away from its route west of the narrow Jumusensalm.
The police will find out the cause of the events.
A friend-in-law firefighter Matti Willman said in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and a rather harsh wind.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will check what the situation is at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is an inland waterway vessel that currently operates as a restaurant ship, with the largest allowed number of passengers being 180 persons.
The ship also has a private meeting room.
According to the ship's website, cross-sections have been established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers require Robert Helenius’s unpaid fees
Fighter Robert Helenius's evening match against Erka Teper is a shadow of money.
Mr Jaakko Helminen and the Vice-President Jussi Kokkila announced today that Helenius would be charged a total of more than EUR 80,000 in outstanding manager fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helena on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to reconcile, but there's no other option.
This has been a clear mandate, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius’s current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to the evening newspaper stating the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastinen, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in a financially economically depressed situation with Helenius and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorships for him.
It was said that Helenius was obliged to pay the fees only for percentages of his matches.
Remembrance was assured that Helenius did not need anything to pay, only to receive the income they organized.
This is also a normal and only practice for professional athletes.
The salary work has never been agreed, and it would also have been insane in the situation of Helena, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Vastinen, Helenius would have wanted to make a written agreement on income distribution from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman received a draft at the end of 2014.
He pointed out that the proposal was in itself poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not take time to deal with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helena was shown to be “inexhaustible but large-scale – a decline in the work of the manager.
This year, the deck has been picked up with the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s ex-post activities to be destitute, in exchange for it.
Helenius is meeting today at Erkan Teper's Stuttgart, the seventh IBF heavy series interviewer list.
A hearty man and a good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka-Ile-Valio felt the late radio driver and reporter Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line radio driver and supplier Erkki Päll died at 83 years of unhealed liver cancer.
The drinker's death report was published on Sunday in the Helsinki Sanoma.
The report says Päll's dead on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on Facebook’s Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, Ile Vainio also saw the publication, which he died of.
He left a good-bye on Facebook earlier, Ile Vaino says.
Vainio keeps Erkki Päll as a multi-climate participant, who became a great supplier.
He remembers Päll's being considered a person with fast hot dogs and funny stories.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first went on a 12-year-old Finnboard and started there as a warehouseman.
Then we met Erk.
He was then a finnboard informant and a different job, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I went on to make the albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of opportunities where Erkki Pälli was a standard supplier of all the things he did about artists.
He was always expert, and I saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin he interviewed.
He was a kind man and a good journalist.
For many, he became well-known as Yle’s radio driver, but he also wrote excellent journals.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vaino thank you.
Through the decades, Pälli worked alongside the supplier’s work in Fazer’s record company, Tou Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Lorir's album.
However, the biggest passion of the sun was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He has been working on radio since the 1960s, and he became familiar to a number of listeners in the Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Union announced on Saturday that the financial year of the Union ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Association describes the fullness translation of its financial situation, even though the economy is burdened by a significant debt in the balance sheet.
Mika Kulmala, Executive Director, welcomes rapid response and tight economic discipline.
We responded to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible to adapt.
The careful design and economic management of the operation has been hit through our entire organization, Kulmala says in the press.
We have also been very successful in the procurement of partners, and in addition, the world-class returns were maximum in the past period of competition.
However, in the future, cost management must also be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Tens of bodies lie in the hospital’s backyard Please stay in the city of Indonesia on Sulawes Island.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled for the purpose of assessing the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to extremities.
One of the people who moved to the hospital area was the 52-year-old Alien Baharudd, who was looking for his son.

He described the atmospheres in the city as passions.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are robbed everywhere, said Kuuma.
Many people please sleep outside or in temporary bamboo rivers.
Even though the house is somehow in place, possible traces could be destroyed permanently and buried by the inhabitants.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners that were in prison were escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there may be approximately 300 carcases.
Some of the prisoners in the prison in Donggara have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became angry and set fire to the prison after the guards had denied them to leave their relatives suffering from earthquakes and tsunamis.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first ones on the field, the military C-130 truck landed, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please only allow the field limited.
The pilots are forced to land on the field without the assistance of the air traffic controller, as the air traffic control tower was damaged by a bad earthquake.
Rain wipes overnight over Finland
The whole country spreads across the country on Sunday night, from the west direction to a long rainy area, according to the Department of Climate Sciences.
Rain comes mostly as water, but it is expected to travel or snow in Central and North Lapa.
Last night's bouquets are not repeated because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty efficiently in check.
In the West, you can immediately visit the packaging side, said the emergency meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will disappear in the eastern direction of the morning.
In the south and west, there are poles or half clouds.
At noon, temperatures always move to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week looks like the same in the southern and middle parts of the country for thermal facilities, but the weather becomes more unstable.
In maritime areas, wind and wave resources are in place.
It is not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical change in autumn weather.
That autumn is now going to start beating up seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland will not see the final on TV
IL-TV allows you to follow the red carpet glamour and shade of Miss Finland competition.
In the evening magazine, entertainment suppliers pull direct broadcasts on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs dress.
The shipment starts at about 18.50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from ten finalists.
Miss Finland 2018 will be held in Billnäs's dress in Raasepor.

Other representatives of the jury are well-being entrepreneur Juta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Joun Chamber of Commerce Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and standing news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he could get to the university before he went to the mischiefs.
The Russian Dimitri-father and inkerile Svetlana-mother believed their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
New Miss Alina Voronkov’s parents, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud of their daughter’s first moments away from the crown.
They sat in the audience from Pertunamaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful feeling!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is English and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks of a smooth Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than my career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty that she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio driver.
Only later, Alina was excited about the beauty competitions.
The parents wanted Alina to get to the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and finally, Alina wanted to do a postgraduate degree before the mischiefs.
Last year, we asked why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish the deck.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults as well.
He's sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is working in Japan and has not been able to encourage Finland to love the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the young person’s relationship will last for a year.
That's what I mean!
My parents wanted my daughter to visit you soon.
It's been such a long break to visit because of the missionaries.
I'm sorry, but I've already put messages.

More information on the case is available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - a dream of cartoonism: lack of drawing skills didn’t slow down
At the time, my husband went out of the veil, where he suggested it to be a person for the story I developed, says Espoola's comic blogger, home mother, and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was an EU translator in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returner ten years ago.
I've enjoyed my mother so well.
This has been the best time in my life, but at some point it came to mind what to do when the smallest child started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture became a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintt and Asterix from a small age.
I had drawn last as a child, but when these manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
I started with a few dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a talented artist, but I couldn’t get her involved until summer 2016, when I gave the Five drawings.
His passion lasted a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
For the paper, I didn’t even try to draw, says Piippo’s relationship, which he usually does in the evening.
The manuscripts are constantly popping up, but I usually don’t make it at once.
One of the three square stripes is going to take up to several hours.
I can make a screen at a time and play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the contemporary newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As individuals, the L-tea has been shattered by a carrot-sleeved mother with a salad-sleek.
The other people are the Man, the Pig and the Twins.
In the natural world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer forced bulls, even though the natural facade is infiltrated between things.
Bishop tells me he's reading his series with his husband and his children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon and you say that this is what I’ve done today.
And there are enough challenges for mothers!
You can read the series on the web at the address of the creation shop.series-photologs.com

Indonesia earthquake: Flight manager sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe.
Indonesia's earthquake hero has risen to 21-year-old flight manager Anthony Gunawan Agung.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until hundreds of passengers were safely transported from the island that was treated by the earthquake.
The young one was on the way to the command of the Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie flight in the city, when the earthquake hit Friday.
When others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being driven from Batik Air’s passenger plane to the air.
Thus, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was bent and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered serious internal organ injury.
Agung was tortured to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopters to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the air administration representative told The Jakarta Post.
The acceleration continued to reach the air and was ultimately measured as a force of 7.5 magnitude.
His spirit lost at least 832 people.
Indonesia’s aviation administration has respected Agung’s solidarity in social media.
Rehn said: \"We need to look at the following tweets:
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth assessment.
President Olli Rehn said in Yle's first meeting that although tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which, in turn, reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
In the opinion of Rehn, Europe is very good at this time.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be on the feet of the trade war.
We need to look at the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in the interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most debt countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacts heavily to the Italian Government’s Thursday evening to clearly present a deficit budget.
Next year’s deficit is more than 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's lending stock is problem credit and there are more than 10% of unorganized loans.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country appears to be again crossing its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in the couch.
This distinction would have far more negative effects.
Rehn began as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB) withdraws his mission after a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name have been corrupted in words.
I'm sure it's okay if the Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment on this further.

“There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the earth and a very current health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the suppliers and photographers of HS and continue the discussion.
Helsinki Sanomat has been organizing the nights of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often end-selling.
There have already been more than 15,000 people in the audience.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier galaxy as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners thanked the new way of making journalism and journalists want to come close to their readers.
In the spring of 2019, the Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The presentation also takes place in Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has different content than in this autumn evening.
The missing humidifier was found – thanks to an unexplained experiment –
The Finnish Police Drone is the world’s top: “We are asking about training.
According to the police university chief, the police can use drones in addition to missing searches, for example, in criminal investigation and intelligence.
The Oulu police managed to find a missing fungus in Raah on Tuesday with a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, director of the University of Police University of America, mentioned, among other things, that, through unprecedented experimentation and effective education, we are also the world’s top in the world.
Drone is quite a new one, and it's also more recent in police positions.
There is no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be a drone use champion.
According to Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has been explained, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to visit the Finnish police’s drones.
We're asking for training.
More and more
Himberg recalls that finding lost in winter conditions in Finland is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, lost was found with the drone only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drones.
According to Himberg, they are meant to be trained more.
Drone is already being used in police positions a lot, and its use will be widespread and increased in the future.
That's how I dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain intelligence positions.
For example, we already need to check out a region a little further, which may be feared to face violence there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary research.
Karjalan Rugby
Karjalan Rugby celebrates in Kuopio on Saturday 2nd edition of the victory.
They were still in the middle of the match at 7-12 at the Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second episode and dried the South guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd edition championship knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to its 1st division.
Previously, the club has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish Rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-group 1 division.
The club is going to take the show, but it will know a lot of work next winter.
The current low-to-two player's roster must be raised to 25.
The 1st division also knows the increase in the number of games and the longer gaming trips, so it must also be in line with the acquisition of funds.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the main coach
The Montreal Canadians chief coach Claude Julien, who plays in the ice hockey industry, confirmed on Twitter that the Finnish hero Jesper Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise for Kotkaniemi, in the first round of 18 at three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training security for the end of the season and has put forward strong extracts in the September exercise matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to make a goal in his first training match.
Julien, the chief coach, praised the Finnish authorities for taking large-scale development programmes to the arrival camp after arrival.
The NBL’s frame series starts next week on Thursday’s night against Thursday.
Montreal meets in the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
A lot of leadership has been discussed in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, the President of the Nokia Government, Risto Siilamaa, told her book Paranoid, an optimist in which she illuminates the philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Olila.
Olila strongly denied the accusations, but earlier Nokia reports have discussed the lack of leadership as a team; fear and speechlessness, in which it caused the collapse of mobile business.
The company’s risk-taking capacity and friction were lost.
In Helsinki, a business giant event was also held at Nordic Business Forum, which attracted the Finnish business life club to the Exhibition Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, the 12 stars of the business world rose to the stage.
It's enough to make a call for good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management students, said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most spiritually linked to past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods chain known as a wide range of organic products, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that goal can not be just to win for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the success book, said that the most successful leaders are the humblest of the investigation.
They act calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodara, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must be hit with one of the stages of the business life cycle.
At the start of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
The company that grew up in a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These guides at Nordic Business Forum were listening to 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
There was a threat to information.
A good leader is required a lot.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, also at the highest level.
There were Siilamaa and Olila.
They talked to each other in a cohesive manner.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy to evaluate outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on a great red carpet right from Los Angeles - to spend most of his years abroad
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the missionary in a magnificent black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland’s look-alike dress also had a picnic.
I'm a bit of a store of jets.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me about his membership.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles.
He has made advertisements, among other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, and also similar to in Finland.
However, work with him must be done more quickly, as there is always a substitute for the model’s work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The award is awarded annually to an artist or group operating on the live art field.
The Danish police found a large Volvo in the mission: “We can’t tell you where to go.
The extensive search of the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of Juutinrama and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Sjärlann was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the Central Centre of the Copenhagen Police.
The car we found was found.
We can't yet tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm of Copenhagen's police report tells Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, black Volvo has no direct contact with the police.
He said the biggest danger is over.
Danish extra Bladet told the police about Saturday's conference.
Jørgen Bergen Skov was the head of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us what the criminal name is looking at.
Skov said, however, that it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been withdrawn.
Copenhagen police also followed events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public is no longer concerned about the threat of certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused a decade of rain - now the people will vote on it in the elections.
The proposal for a new name for the country is currently being voted in Macedonia in the Balkans.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of Macedonia would be named.
To date, Greece has blocked its veto law in Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to the northern province.
The question of the referendum is not to mention a new name, but to ask whether the voter is in favour of the EU-NATO membership of Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
The vote began on a network at least at a school in the centre of the capital of Skopje.
Oliver Argirosvka, a retired nurse at school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been named in official contacts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
A national-minded right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see if voting is more than 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but yes-voting profit would allow the mandain to change the constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament's legislation.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
Voting venues are closed from the mid-weeks of Finland.
That's a great win!
Robert Helenius shattered Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erka Teper's heavy series of professional fighters in Germany.

Canada fights against time to reach a war with the United States
Time is at the end of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The U.S. has set aside on Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada’s chief advisor, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
President Donald Trump's request to the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement with each other, but there was no agreement with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in early December.
Trump said that Canada’s involvement in the treaty is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans are to sign the agreement at the end of November - Canada was involved or not.
As a result of these schedules, the agreement text between the United States and Canada should be completed on Sunday, so that the U.S. Congress will have enough time to assess it.

Kisses swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS’s Pöytävivi alarmed Finland’s record in a 50-meter butterfly, where he was the second in the early 2282.

Students pretend to be rare: ancient tragedy - a simple Oreste affects their visuality
Ancient tragedy is rare in Finnish scenery.
For example, the last time the National Theatre has seen an ancient tragedy, the Sofokleen Philoktetes, in 1988.
The Theatre School now brought the only complete drama trilogy, Aiskhylos Orestean, on a tour from the National Theatre.
In the early 2015 Lavak Open! projects, theatre school actress students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The first international evening of Oreste was held in Berlin in April.
The composition of Roihan from Orestea will sum up the report on the end of the Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, with a maximum of twenty minutes, in particular by sealing the contributions of the choir.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirst Simon’s fine Finnish (2003).
Dramatic lights and theatre pages reveal the revelation of the fear and bright vision.
Its center is in turn the dynamics between the performers who break out of the shell, the name roles, and the chorus.
The presentation uses both double and triple seats of the title roles.
Actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murder of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and of this war hall is shown on the stage, unlike the ancient premiere.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient premiere.
Rather, in front of the viewer’s eyes, a modern, faithful interpretation is created, which is constantly conscious of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to get out of the Master’s Degree Actors as a close group, directly as one organism, a rhythmic group.
Especially in the choirs of very expressive, sculptive group formations, brightly bending actors will be able to get their rights bare, only by decorating the white curtain.
That's impressive.
The performance tour of Orestea continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures his first hydrogen truck
The renewal begins to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyinda and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA Car Show, Hyundai will deliver a series of new models of thousands of cars for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing on the market the fuel-powered truck Hyundai will continue to use the Nexon and ix35/Tücson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a hydrogen manufacturer.
With this quality, the first project in the world, we will take fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the gas pipeline, in Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, said at the public conference.
Nyrks fell on several occasions in Kajaan
A little over 30-year-old man was assaulted by three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and on Saturday morning.
He first hit one man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the place.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and the third man in the absence of the situation was still hit by the offender.
The police caught the rapper.
At the police station, the man still behaved aggressively and fired another police officer on foot.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the pipe to calm down.
The matter will be investigated in three cases of abuse and in the form of a violent objection to the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, another case of assault occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Canadian man hit the victim.
A little later, another man poured him into the ground, and the man who hit him earlier fired the victim.
The aliens pulled the offenders away from the victim and called the police.
However, they were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will request witnesses of the event to contact the Police of Kajaan by phone at +358 5 416 520 or by e-mail at inquiry.inu@poliisi.fi.
The long line radio driver Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term supplier, died of cancer at 83 years of age.
Radio Driver Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
It's going to be all right.
The doctor has also said that I live day by day, he commented on the situation in Malta a month ago.
We need to ensure the safety of the shops' fillings and pigs.
For the first time, I was hired for journalism in 1984.
When this year’s rings surprises a subject, it’s usually a big news issue.
When I wrote (Karishan, 27.9.) about the safety of retail workers, I was surprised and at times I was even a little angry.
I also discussed the case with the Professional Association of Services (PAM) professional environmental expert Erika Kähärára.
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers say otherwise.
The police know only clearly serious cases and many of the real violence are left unreported.
“The companies have a duty to statistics closely on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect any information,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they are not always born with physical injuries.
In spite of this, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threat of violence is difficult to pull when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence - even if there is no access to the hands.
Too many people are afraid of their job, even though there is no real action.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
In the event of the release of open hours in shops, even in the media, the visibility of the media was quite high on its effects on the safety of the sellers.
“At the same time, many employers arranged security services at least for nighttime feelings and to prevent work alone,” Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This would seem to have had an effective impact, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the incidents remained well under control because of the security, the idea was that the security would be unnecessary.
In many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
It is quite understandable that the seller who has been assaulted does not want to file a request for investigation of a criminal who usually lives in a commercial area.
However, according to the law of 2011, a mild abuse becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think there is a need for a precedent now.
The next time the trade aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When the court put a couple of offenders in prison, and the sentence from the hard way of the punishment, the customs would be cleaned.
A society where the food trade must be open for almost a day at a small location must ensure the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for Miss before the beginning of the direct shipment, Sara, Iiro then married...
Missi’s crowning this year is not seen in a traditional way on TV, but on Viafree’s website.
The shipment is run by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are a plot of Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the runner’s triangle told the invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh app.
Now all women are screaming!
Now look at this man-runer, Sohlberg glowed his colleague in the crowd's hurricane.
The front race is followed by many previous years by Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Siepp sat next to him, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would lock it in the corner.
The more I think Sohlberg was referring to the divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comments, even though it seemed confusing at first.
For the first time, Siepp was talking about his divorce in the newspaper of the Eastern Sanoma.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open the reasons for the distinction in public, as it is between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry to a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own affairs, and especially on living my own life alone, Sara Siepp said.
Harjula’s marriage became even later, when Sohlberg accidentally made a mistake to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The drinker's triple laughed at the dirt.
Iro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi just hung up.
The Northern Man tortured himself by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The Northern District District District District Court has condemned the 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for three years in prison.
Among other things, the crime was a belt, cable and tickets.
The court condemned these objects to the State.
The crime was suspected of a serious rape.
However, this accusation was rejected.
Four abuses, brutal abuse, forcedness, illegal threats, an abuse of freedom, a serious conflict of freedom, and two damages were considered.
Crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday, after the end of the week, the Northern District District Court issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two serious crimes of freedom and serious rape on May 22.
However, these accusations were rejected as unproven.
The case was discussed behind the doors closed in court.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the judge, the accused had been subjected to violence, threats and forced into situations where this had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to lose criminal means: belt and cable, flags, bath belt, knife and vest.
Four Witnesses
According to the Court of Appeal, the parties continued to pursue a common life between the actions.
It is clear from the sentence that a large proportion of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
The victim’s 34-year-old should be compensated for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
He hardly has any such money, because the sentenced has already had his old debts in his inheritance.
Penalty is not the first of the man.
The newspaper does not give a condemned name to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not the case in writing.
Europe’s four-point solution for Ryder Cup
European golf professionals captured their leadership on Saturday in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Paris flames to play Ryder Cup at 10-6 when there are still twelve games playing on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four football matches that began on Saturday, and won 2-2 in the afternoon.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had ever reached the same level.
On Sunday, the twin seeks more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and no American has been able to do that by three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the brutal harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: “The power is not included in football.
On Sunday, HJK announced that it condemns its supporters’ conduct of disruptive behaviour in the FC Honka match in Tapiola.
“We are calling for events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” the report states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters ran into the field and some seemed to try to challenge Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
Organists were not able to calm down, but they needed policemen and horsemen.
HJK reports that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old association.
“We strongly release any action that endangers the safety of matches events,” the report states.
HJK’s promise will help authorities and organisers to find out about the factors that threaten safety and eliminate mild phenomena.
Support culture is part of football and it is important for HJK.
We all support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football.
“It’s not the authority,” the press says.
Filipino inventors fly on a drone car - thus avoiding traffic congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancers and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group of people in the world who swear to have invented a flying car or at least their own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he did the first successful test flight... he flagged his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will create positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL forecast: Tomorrow’s work fighting activities will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
In public and well-being areas tomorrow, overwork and shift bans will appear, especially in social and health services and in children’s day care, the JHL’s President, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff in place.
Everyone has to think about how to apply for their children.
The employer’s task is now to take care of the fact that the services are playing and that no one’s spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the staff's poverty was also visible at the beginning of the year, when the members of the JHL were banned from overwork and shift due to the negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that the staff has not been hired, but that the workers have been overworked or changed.
This is not a job struggle yet.
It is a normal standard for every worker to take care of and only do so for regular working hours.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to reduce the protection of the dismissal of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director of the Labour Market of municipal workers, will not pre-empt the effects of overwork and exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very complicated, even though the services can be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Janonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week we had experience, among other things, about the activities of the Middle and Basic Board of Super and the Social and Health Professionals Association Tehy, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather minor.
The JHL overtime and shift ban covers, among other things, municipalities, the church, the state, and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are outside.
At this stage, almost 100,000 JHL members are involved in the fight.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may last a long time.
The Association has also been prepared for other work combat measures if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that this is where we run into the wall and hard.
Both the Ay movement and the government must resist.
It is special here that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the show has not been given yet, Janonen updates.
The great Corallirity is born in the gym circles of children and adults, studying the elephants of the ruse and sea horse
In other places, the Great Corallership received its first night in Hamburg last spring, and last Saturday it was presented in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Corallirity is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer cross-border presentation will also be built, which will refresh and thank the initial observations made in practice.
There are hundreds of magic in the theaters, too, for children’s participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The great Corallirity is not a children's performance, but a presentation that adults and children work together.
It gives adults information and observations about the way in which children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into exercises and joint clips also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The great Corallirity is a bit like a fairyblet, a fitness circle, and a natural state of information, but it is finally refreshed in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The great Corallirus begins to explore the business lines of corals and coralrills and fish.
In six different districts of fitness, we learn about, amongst other things, the creatures of the furry and sea horse.
Finally, a low-hour presentation will be made, where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral ring.
There are both divers who observe the life of the coral ritual and the corals that are examined.
There are also bodies looking at corals.
The views and observations shown in many directions make the presentation dense and life flourish.
Whether it's an organic landscape, a landscape-looking body, and another organ or landscape that looks at the body - and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn’t seem difficult.
In other areas, the group strives for a limit of thought and action to be caught when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, children’s involvement makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitratori will hold a quiet demonstration for the endangered corals.
The destruction of man’s understanding must not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising his compassion in the face of destruction.
In other places, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life in political life as well.
There are other generations, there are different types of consciousness, other species and future generations whose wonders and clips it will shed space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad that my childhood wasn't smart.
Today’s children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking smoking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not fight their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do so.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth-class sister on the weekend from a boy friend.
When he came to get his drowned sister, he told me about his sex experiences that night.
I can't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that we can't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they would not need to grow up because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I constantly see younger girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal in the evening.
Girls are even more difficult to guess what age they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood wasn't smart.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Officials told the government that the case of Airist Helm was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, Ilkka Kanerva, the defense police and defence forces were inquiring the military and defence elections earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the Airist Helme investigation is not currently involved in national security, but in organised crime, Yle said.
The information from the sources present was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (kok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and Defence Police were conducting an ongoing investigation in the defence and foreign affairs elections this week.
This is primarily considered to be a financial crime.
They were very strict about not speculating that there would be more, Kanerva commented on Yle’s interview.
According to the above data, no evidence of the material seized so far has been found on the link to national security, but the investigation is only under investigation.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from it, one of Yle's interviewers says.
A week ago, the extensive search for home in Turku and mainland has raised the question of whether research is a matter of mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
This week, the evening magazine was a story that would go through claims both in favour and against.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool’s lost series
Liverpool’s 100 percent of Valoliiga’s start was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the team’s 1-1 game at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be the same year that Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to 1-0 guests.
At that time, Pep Guardila's combination sent the entire Valoliiga signal that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool’s manager Jõrgen Klopp arrived at the same idea in West London.
The Reds had started the Valioliiga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virginia van Dijk seemed to control his own field end alone.
In turn, Chelsea had a great summer trip from Anfield Road.
At that time Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the game with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first played in a small state with a trio teacher Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the croat saw Hazard's falling forward and sent him a fully-pressed breakthrough.
Hazard drove a little to the bottom of the punishment zone, but bombed the perfect left foot to the back corner of the bet.
Half's brassievah, Alison, was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
The Klopp must have felt a loss position slightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger fell off the Mo Salah direction line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Veskari Kepa also worked out.
Baskivahti reacts quickly to the Sadio Mané’s bet and pushed the ball from the top of the tolpa to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed his throw through Hazard.
The best place for visitors came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino at his center.
However, the Brassähtääht bag was directed towards the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the host's leadership.
Nor could it last 89 minutes, when the exchanger Daniel Sturrridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of an irresistible bet at the top of the corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent overrun was completed with a 1-1 game, but it's still in the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the masterpiece with two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer discussion, the posters are deep
I remember when a few decades ago a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers, which divides the people of Finland.
Juice Leskisen's answer remained the only one: Nen's head.
Some of the relatives have a nose head and some don't.
There can be a dealer anywhere, and there was one waiter here.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock transfer will be abandoned.
A lot of people agree that the clock transfer twice a year has been a fool's job and caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest step in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide which time to end up at the end of the time: the current summer or winter or other time zone.
This can also be said by the people on the poll.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
There is a lot of discussion on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their words to say.
The wintertime defenders argue with the effect of the morning light on people’s well-being and summer time, with the effect of the evening light on people’s desire for outdoor activities and thus on the well-being.
Both positions have solid supporters and good arguments.
According to the studies, the morning light is shaking people’s day and gives freshness.
On the other hand, if not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn nights.
The number of extra light after the normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but the evil for us in the northern corner of the earth is nothing we can do.
Winters are too dark and summers for many too bright in any case.
It is typical for the debate on the subject to be that their views are driven and the other view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other party are not just listening, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Because almost everyone has an opinion, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn the other’s head.
It's going to burn the pieces.
The subject is a very simple argument, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and sufficient knowledge of the mud to justify it.
In other words, similar types of things are usually more brutal and equally infertile.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but don't you think it's going to work out.
And always, it also offers a suitable sin suit if life feels like a monkey.
Josba
Josba’s first guest game in Divar of Salibandy produced a complete three-point series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went from the Wall to the home trip with a joy of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo continued to paint at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time, 50.47 brothers Ettu and Juuso Lehhtiniemi ran to 6-5 wins.
In the icebergs of both teams, crucial minutes were played on a flat-screen basis.
The most effective was Juuso Lehhtiniemi (2+1).
The 2nd chain was firepower when Teemu Tuhken (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenk (1+0) also played in the second chain at the moment of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
Next, O2-Jyväskylä will be there in two weeks.
the Church of Eno on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated on Sunday in some very sad atmospheres.
A week ago, the destruction of the church at the climbing risk was a shock.
The church was guarded two nights after the fire.
In spite of the tusk, today is still a place for the party.
Although no one would like to do so, the Church of Eno is the oldest church in the Church of Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the local and other covenants of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno Church at 10:00 a.m.
After that, the church house will be moved to the cattle table.
The program has all kinds of things inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be familiar with the guidance of Ari Räsässen, who has retired for 37 years as a church master.
The church’s birthday also means the end of one time.
Already used, a church house built in 1982 keeps its doors open today for the last time.
Now, we're on the road at the former municipal house, and Markku Koistinen says.
The church house destroyed the internal air problems, but the church has stood healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the Tesla Government's President's position - Petos' accusations were filed with $40 million
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO of the company, have agreed on a legal case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being expelled from the company he founded.
Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to leave the Tesla Presidency for three years.
The company has to hire the Chairman of the External Government.
Musk is also subject to more strict supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla must employ two independent leaders and monitor the communication of Musk in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about 17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and the disadvantages of Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin SEC.
The incident started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding has been secured.
Tvitti immediately raised Tesla’s share rate.
SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a security fraud.
According to the Agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential funders of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, SEC announced that he would challenge the law of the company and Musk.
SEC claimed that Musk would be sentenced to fines and would be banned from acting in the management of stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge was driven by investors, and Tesla’s share went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia and the tsunami.
In Indonesia’s earthquake and subsequent tsunamis, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, the country’s disaster agency according to AFP.
The number of deaths is still believed to be increasing, as it is ongoing to resolve the damage.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city on the island of Sulawes.
The tsunami was immediately followed by a warning, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead are at least for the time being a fire.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggala near the center of the lake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to be dead.
Peaceful Requests for Assistance
The Indonesian army has been alarmed to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon called on the soldiers to continue their rescues without evacuating the day and night.
One of the central points of rescue is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to be 50-60 people in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Agency for Rescue, said that one of the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel's popular commercial travelers was discovered at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
Syaug said that a heavy grappling ship would be quickly digested into the synonymous and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones in the lost.
Help me, you're in the palace and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
The phone numbers of politicians leaked into the hands of the warts in Britain
Many British politicians were disturbed when their contact details were leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
Among other things, the alarms got into the phone numbers of ministers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party.
For example, Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson, became the subject of harassment.
A number of MPs have been disturbed.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profile of politicians who were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The audience was able to access profiles using the political e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The account was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile for a moment as a porno and a title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed from the mediamogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the conference app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with these email addresses.
Then the subscriber can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The conference app made the phone number of each supplier, politician and participant public, Foster criticised.
The Conservative Party's informant asked for an information leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The UK Information Authority supported the flow of data.
The application was developed by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland visit audience every week has a large number of ground-breaking Polishers
Observers paid attention to the studio reactions of The Wall Finland.
The Wall, the rapidly spread US format, was a Finnish version of Nelose last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is described in the same studio in Poland, where other international productions are made.
In Poland’s studio, the description opportunities were exceptional, as the large 12 meters high in the format required space.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the program’s studio audience, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, there was a conversation about whether the Polishs might be sitting in the studio about the game to be played in Finnish.
The head of Nelonen’s domestic programs, Ulne Srmunen, will enlighten the issue on the evening newspaper.
He tells us that the studio is close to players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international killers in Finnish production, just as the audiences of the Wall periods described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, there are also such carrots, so-called professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of different programs, will be re-educated by Sõmunen.
He recalls that following the game in itself is not so difficult to explain even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in a foreign-language studio that carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the events as a simulation exception to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then guides the audience and tells us what kind of heat is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago in Talent Finland.
He always had a simulation in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions, the sum of the ring.
Japan’s South-East-North Orifoon is moving towards the main island - the authorities warn of earthquakes and floods
Authorities also warn about possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifoon Tram, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there is still no record of the deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK public radio company, people have been evacuated into shelters, and electricity has lost more than 30,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to take place near Osaka during half a day of Finland’s time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also hard winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to the scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Essie
The start of the weddings has been bad.
The sky was almost dark when the team lost its home on Saturday to Vaasa Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Portuguese now have five consecutive losses, and the six rounds have two points in total.
No Ässien defender or two lower chain players have yet to paint.
The pressure is growing all the time.
It was a bad time for the audience to break down when half of the game was left.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
You have to be careful, because that's how weak we played.
In particular, the performance of the second batch was ashamed of the bad, the performances of Ässi were 1+2 by Jarno Kärki.
Of course, the victory for the sport was tasted.
The team had under the game on Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible.
Maybe it did, but you didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the day of bread continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Härinen, wonders the audience of the event at the big hall.
And somehow he thought that this year maybe not so much people would come, Mr. Horrorinen would think about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Tractorikynnö SM competitions were held at the same time with the Leiday, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even decrease from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already tightly blocked before ten, the sellers said the products had ended, the news drill was sold more than 500 servings and the number of cars he heard was rising.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, Härine will tell you later in the afternoon.
Five hours in the morning and five hours in the afternoon, there was a great deal of program for families with children, which probably attracted them to the record.
In addition, Mr. Hyorinen estimates that the event will take longer.
The sellers are also in a larger area every year.
This year, rapporteurs, craftsmen, bakers and salesmen of harvest products had arrived at the bakery for almost 100.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hehärinen, wanted to see the audience in the hall.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
The beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemi won a public vote.
11 different types of bread came to the children's bread competition.
Marjata Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Ruislevi competition, spent the day in the marts' pie shirt.
7 x Most Beautiful Light - This is how you recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space for life, create the right atmosphere for interior and read the book without feeling tired.
Good lighting is worth a hundred.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor for your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more age years are behind.
Enough light can help with problems that many people have with age when vision accuracy decreases and blurring suffers more and more.
Even the need for light increases.
A six-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth raining on the effects of light and on the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
Good lighting gives enough light, but does not be shy, Jokinemi pulls.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be found with the right lighting solutions.
The interior of this moment is free to choose.
There is a Japanese style that combines elasticity, Scandinavianity and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, his 70s inspiration received modern and play retrotyl with strong colors, metal with different shades or ice creams has risen to the boom.
The authenticity is fascinating in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
Materials now feature wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold light bulb with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
It is not necessarily necessary to buy the newest trend lamp at home, but a timeless classic for which it has been saved for many years.
Some kind of timeless, corrugated and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and good-bye!
Kokokoo showed the door to the Canadian hero after three games
KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are on their way.
The Canadian hero played three League games in orange music without power points, Kokoo says in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year agreement, which included a period of testing that lasted until the end of September.
In the last season, 26-year-old attackers played in KHL in Kunund Red Star's lines and KHL farm in KHL's Heilongjiang.
There's no information about O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to show an example of recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed to paper
The game specializes in the game is now recycled, not only the games, but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone footwear trade customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
For example, products ordered from the online store will be packed into packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us go to re-use.
We may use boxes ten times, as long as the package is in order to use it, Ville Purula from Oulu’s Player.
As a soft material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials as a rule.
The plastic door is as far as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move to the recycling material in the envelope.
The movement also wants to show example to others.
Recycling is not a cause for extra effort.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
It also has financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is used again.
Recycling is suitable for the gamer’s work naturally, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, inter alia, the games and equipment used.
Every fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from the season to the other outfit.
They create the foundation of a good wardrobe with their multi-useity, as it is easy to collect a variety of homes at the expense of quality classics.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes a black party.
The black needle made of natural material cannot be mistaken.
It can be combined with both straight trousers, boring muscles and jeans, and it can be created around it both in a decorded housing unit and in a dirty style.
Poolooneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic decorated style artist.
That's how you create a style.
The autumn trend list is made of gold browns and wide-sleeved, black semi-sleeved, and gray ankles.
The classic half-life, together with other classics, blue-green scotching and wine-red licensees, forms a feminine and refined set of residences.
Brings the black half-sleeved shirt by combining it with the tire's trendy clothes: jeans skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this method of action.
During the Soviet Union, sabotage activities were specialized by the so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from a group of Russian-speaking disversionno-razvedyvatnas: a group of sabotages and intelligences.
Officials of the U.S. Security Service in the West of the KGB prepare detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
The sites were, among other things, ports, bricks, large streams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired DRG groups for the cover operations of Bundeswehr, railways, warehouse guards and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspection stations for you from the Peninsula to the Ukrainian leaders, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
The Cold War agents hid sabotages for the sabotage groups with mines, explosives, lighters, and media.
In 1998, the KGB’s cover was found in Switzerland, which was exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four wheels in the county at night.
Police got caught on different sides of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old man in the container sounded 1.57 promimetres.
In the first half of the night, he was driving two passengers.
In the Kuorevaantie of Polvijärvi, the car was closed for four nights, and a 19-year-old local man in the car blew up 1.54 promimetically.
He didn't get any serious injuries out there.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old man driving a passenger car blew up the alchemy at 1.33 promimina.
The police suspect these male drivers from a serious race and the driver of Lake Polvijärvi as well as the risk of road safety.
In Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man who carried a local van at the Öllölöläntie and Hoikantie crossings blew 0.52 promimetically.
He's suspected of being a rat drink.
The police will ask for observations on the incident after midnight at the Turku Railway Station.
Police said the man was assaulted at the parking lot with the most life-threatening consequences of the station.
It was stored in a surveillance camera.
Dark-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets immediately left after the stabilization with a dark farm car in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect left the bicycle in the direction of the Humaliston street.
The pedestrian died after being frozen under the bus in Por
In the dust, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after the bus crash with him.
The accident occurred after the fourth morning in the area of Nituna.
The driver of the bus is not suspected of a crime.
The police are investigating the accidents that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the season, the test period of Lehtinen ended
Mika Loola, the sports director of HPK in Hämeenlinlinna, says that Filip Riska (average).
The Filip Riska, who played in the early season, continues in Hämeenlinlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The successful roles offered to him were assured by the leadership.
Filip has been important to us in the beginnings of a piece, in sub-power playing and in the defence role of the four-field.
Even though there is still an improvement, it is good to hold on to this experienced player in the young team, the HPK Sports Manager Mika Suola commented on the following information.
According to the hope, the value of Riska rises to the ice hockey league when playing the solution games.
Riska, a central predator from Pietarsaari, has played the league earlier in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the test time.
The story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice.
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
The film was made on the basis of them.
Everest now receives his first night on the Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltazar Kormákuri’s 2015 guidance tells us about the struggle for survival that has been dealt with infertilized.
The tragedy has been made of films and documents before.
The real events will also be discussed in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were pilots of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was the Hall that used Weathers as a guide.
Weathers could save his life before he left Nepal.
As a result of this and air pressure, he lost sight, which is why the supremacy had to be skipped.
Rob Hall continued his journey and no longer returned.
However, the fighting of Weathers for life and death had just begun.
When the storm rose, he was lost and no longer found back in the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers were left to die.
It was like in the store, he was still on his feet and found the others.
The evil-roated Weathers were thought to continue to die, and once again he was left with his own happiness.
It is clear that contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the players began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated.
The 200-year-old church has been celebrated in church today.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and the celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at 10 a.m. at the church of Eno, after which the cattle table had antiques at Eno’s church house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family.
Prince Armi Rautavuori of Eno was happy that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, says the Iron Mountain.
The fire of the church of the encyclopedia has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Evangelical Lutheran churches in the destroyed fire.
In 1770, the tree church of the hot water was completed.
In the morning, a battle was held, which was silenced and remembered the church destroyed in the fire.
Pictures and videos: The Mexican flashed its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
The powerful hurricane-type symphony was hit on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Institute has provided a red weather warning for the regions of Attika, Peloponnes, Joona Islands, Kykladi and Crete.
There are plenty of floods around Greece in pictures taken from the area.
The video published on Twitter shows how the cities of Kiato in the region of Corinth suddenly appeared instead of the street because of the floods of the river.
The second video shows how the car has been transported to floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnes Peninsula, the wind caused strong shipping.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens guides people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the monitoring of weather information and local authorities’ instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or median, brings with it heavy rains and even flooding.
According to a study published in 2011, the medians appear only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on the road to September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The current storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before it continued its journey to northern and Europe.
In Greece, refugees in the islands, such as Lesbos, have also been caused by concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
There are also areas under the storm that have been destroyed in the summer in the atmosphere of Athens.
In Greece, the Mexican also fell in November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - on the Greek islands threatened by a Syrian storm, thousands of Finns are currently on vacation.
Trails to the sea are cancelled and walking should be careful not to fly branches or other bulking goods on top of the storm.
These instructions have been distributed to the fair 3 500 in Greece through the Sunshines to the Finnish holiday weekend.
The instructions will come to the need, as even the Zorbas storm, which is rising in fear, has been predicted to be a long-term Greek island this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise to 45 metres per second in a cage.
The green rains of the weather are increasing.
All travelers travelling to Greece from Finland who have registered their phone number have been warned by tour operators about hard wind by SMS.
The sun and heat are still in the air.
According to Inka Ikosen, the solar communications expert in Inka Ikosen, on Saturday evening, resorts have been avoided from the worst.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to a normal schedule.
We will follow the situation all the time.
Safety ahead of us.
I supported the media operator Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff in the area.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the start on Saturday.
Tuilla has the most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rhodes and Crete, with a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, some hundreds of travelers are staying in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island will arrive on Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had mocked the sun and the temperature was at 27 degrees, according to the sun’s Ikonen.
Zorbas has been estimated to move into Turkey’s next series, though slightly reduced.
We have been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have looked at, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tuilla, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss have a completely identical evening dress in a missionary - this is how they react to the situation
The media person and fitness beauty designer Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-air evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been selected by the runner Shirley Karvinen.
The two themselves saw the same outfit and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanonom that he had come in urgent preparations, and he had to be put on the plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet driver, and he talks about the brightest stars that arrive.
Huss has a fresh move, because he moved from the campus to the Lake Island on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what's going on.
It is essential that a new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only at a week's hotel without leaving.
When Stress got rid of the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirley Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collecting curious views of pensioners
The runner and the 2016 Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen told her on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final with radio trains and Love Island images.
It has been enough to ensure that Karvinen arrived directly from Finnair’s flight to the final.
I made and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Evening dress change at home, Karvine laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled out his makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw a mirror of people's eyes.
At least everyone thought I was interested in my makeup.
Karvine flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that he enjoyed his nest as a runner of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far as to stop.
Karvinen says he went to the show on Friday with singles.
It's kind of raw.
They are people's genuine emotions, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How do I wear over-burn boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothes are clothes that work from the season to the second place.
In many cases, classics are old for decades, but sometimes they are the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the over-sacrifices of the autumn and winter season have not gone away.
According to their name, the boots above the knee are repeated in style from year to year.
They show boots to share user opinions, but a bold model should be tried, no - bravely.
In fact, the high-level boots are suitable for any kind of housing.
It's about cockroache, lace, boring or trico, boots' chimp leather or artificial leather shoes.
Long boots look good in the holidays as well as in everyday clothes.
The black overburners are well suited to the thin housing.
They properly balance the feminineness of the pink, flowery pliser and hemp, a mule needle.
Fresh but autumn-style everyday with romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-hekin housing consists of a long copper-brown shampoo, over-burning boots, visible earrings and a wet bag.
Although there is a certain fineness in the upper shelf boots, they also perfectly fit into the relaxation of the arcade together with the T-shirt, long shorts and trendy slippery.
It's so easy and still so stylish!
Two robots start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the city of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars play a role in the bus simulator, as the next spring is to be launched on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year round robot vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
In the experiment, we find out how robot cars are doing with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, transport manager.
For the first time, robot cars travel completely automatically in the rest of the traffic area without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger.
Vehicles can always feel their environment with several sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If this is not the case, they will interpret whether the identified obstacle to a vehicle, bicycle or snowshield, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 for the development of robot transport.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn on three days a week: on Tuesdays 13-15.30, on Wednesdays 10-15 and on Thursdays 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops are identified by the stop markings.
More safely, you can get to the car from the parking lot in the Otakare.
The bassist of the Mokoma band fell on stage in the middle of the gig and injured
The Mokoma band informs on its Facebook page about the surprising situation in Tampere’s Packroom gig.
The Mokoma band's gig at the Tampere Packroom was a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell on stage in the middle of the show.
It happened when the band was pulling the last piece of the night.
It's a mess. It's a mess.
The band will inform you on its Facebook page.
“We are in the spirit,” he said.
Yesterday, Santu broke his wrist in the last song in the bakery room and broke his wrist.
Let’s hope for a quick improvement in the metal brother!
The rest of the tour takes care of by means of a backup, the pages read.
Mokoma fans are responsible for the worried image update, where basist-Santtu lays a plaster in the hand of the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty hard to see how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones are improving with time.
Tseppe and quick recovery to Santu and a good tour for another band plus tou!
And thank you for yesterday's wonderful gig, but you promise to leave off this strong dramatic gig in the future?
Police guarded hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Crime Centre in North Karelia and in Ylä-Savo, the police department’s team members told social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was the law and the law of hunting.
Each hunter examined the hunting card and the hunting permit required by the state countries.
In addition, the permit for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted pathogens of self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter who lacked the required hunting permit was met during the inspection.
The hunter was ordered 12 days of unauthorized fishing.
In addition, the police also killed 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them were suspected of riding.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine procedure, the police once.
In summary, it can be concluded that hunters follow the promise of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by control.
A hunter said, “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone looked at the permits.
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The move will go to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrian quota refugees.
Minister of the Interior Kai Mökken (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the choice of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Election trips are usually made a couple of times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Labour and Economic Affairs and the police.
The delegation is already interviewing Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first selects people in particularly vulnerable situations.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to refugee camps, such as single parents, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice, some are left uninhabited for different reasons.
I also like the way in which the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syrian NGOs operate at the border.
The trip is also accompanied by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior, Ilkka Salmi.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has already taken quota packages since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 years, but no agreement has been made in the government since it was raised.
The assembly has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen to the blue counter.
The Prime Minister, Juha Sipilä, recently presented an increase in the quota to 1,500-2 000 people a year.
This is the first time the Minister of the Interior takes the place to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
Former Interior Ministers Petter Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move to their new tasks before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU per refugee in particular vulnerable.
Now, let's go to the hacks and no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article had the idea that the draft law would in principle prohibit the keeping of all animals which were not specifically permitted by the regulation of the ministries in relation to production animals, pets or other business activities.
In other words, everything else is prohibited except the animals mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill becomes legal, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits action that threatens the safety of society or a good way.
It is now starting to regulate the prohibition of all activities to which the law or regulation does not specifically allow.
The change causes that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and to do nothing else before the law or regulation has been adopted.
The government’s work in lawmaking has generally been weak.
If we are now going to the road that everything in Finland is banned, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the law project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think that it is acceptable to accept any such “all” that is not permitted by law or by the regulation.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell tip: Autumn’s four trendy skirts
This autumn's trend vision comes in snake tissue.
It looks particularly good in skirts.
Combine a snake-shaped skirt with more cool upper parts, such as a pole or a regular t-shirt, so that the total stays stylish.
This autumn the silk appears in abundance, and in particular the silk bead is one of the most trendy clothes of the season.
Combine the gorgeous silk skirt beautifully with a feminine upper part or relaxed the needle as a pair.
You can play more bravely with a silk bite and throw in the foot, for example, the sneakers or the autumn trend shoes of cowboy-boots.
It doesn’t matter whether it’s gray, brown or multi-sleeved, all square skirts now belong to each woman’s black hair.
Connect bravely different colors with each other and play with the square joint with the various upper part.
For example, the combination of a square hole and your balls is beautiful.
The insymmetric beads of the summer spring, which can be taken with them in autumn.
The unsymmetric bead is at the same time feminine and playful and perfectly suitable for both the Arctic and the festival.

In Turkey, mobile phones are asked to be charged for a storm
The Zorba storm that blows in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, Meteorologists warned especially the seamen, fishermen and farmers of the West Coast from the Greek storm, CNN Türk wrote.
The tropical storm is said to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday, disaster and emergency authorities invited citizens to download their mobile phone before the storm and to ensure the functionality of the Internet so that people can get up-to-date situation updates, the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People have been urged to stay at home and far from the windows and, for example, move the garden furniture away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to have a heavy rainfall and wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service provided a red weather warning for the regions of Attika, Peloponnes, the island of Joona, Kykladi and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies of Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens also published a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather information and local authorities’ guidelines.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, there was a wind, and it rained.
People were calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen Tui told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not receive messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports did not operate on Saturday, the local news agency Amna said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told by travel agencies to STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy of Athens, temporary disruptions were expected for air and shipping.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen praised the reason for Mercedes' Better Ferrar
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too much a piece of Russian gp time.
However, there is no need for panic in Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimated.
They were faster than us, but nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time for the weekend, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven by Sebastian Vettel, and clearly left the Mercedes speed.
Ferrar was already in the previous race in Singapore.
It was asked where the same fall of Mercedes is due to.
They seem to go faster than we... so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare taste of Räikkönen’s future winter for Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Ferrari for the next season, was the seventh, and the last time-breaking event was also erected by Marcus Ericsson.
The 10th departure for the Swedish driver is best for more than three years.
And even though five drivers left no driving completely in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging the Räikkös?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius stunned Erkan Teperin: \"Robbe is back\"
Robert Helenius and Erka Teper's match at Stuttgart's night went on the same sign.
The German was a more primitive party in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Helenius clearly controlled the match with his hard series, who found it well.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally arrived in the eighth episode when Helenius knocked on the left straight to Teper.
Osuma was so hard that a man in front of the public didn’t even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was very moderately winded.
In an interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponent of the audience.
Then he changed his tongue for a while.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helen was happy right after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps it would be possible to get to the World Cup, Helenius commented on the Evening magazine before the match.
Instead, the whole boxing career could have been decided.
Of course it's been in mind.
This is not going to be any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper scene.
The number of victims of Indonesia’s disaster may be multipled
According to The Guardian, the Vice President of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
The gamers are looking for trapped and also dead people from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please from the port city and its neighboring municipality from Donggala.
To date, all the victims are a request, there is still no clarity on the situation in Donggara.
Hundreds of people are lost and about 540 are injured.
There are still people in the small buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu is broken.
The rescuers tell us that they heard the screams of the people who have fallen from ruins, but the lack of the grappling equipment has delayed the beginning of their rescue work.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has ordered military rescue and deportation.
There is a need for military and its equipment, as electricity and communication connections are across many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also building.
Miss Finland’s inconvenient response and long reflection caused laughter
Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview tour, a question was asked to every missionary.
The finalists asked a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, the unpleasant answer was made in the audience in which the sweet, but delicious laughters were present.
The question asked by Anttikoske had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the misifist has read.
Antikos was thinking about his response to the good news before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read was... Anttikoski said, thinking.
The report was made in the public at a time of laughter until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I’ve read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski got the public's cut-offs in the form of a laughter.
In the past, Anttikoski raised attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21:00, when the crown will be abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple headache cake will take the language by
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from your own background, as domestic apples are at a shocking price in the store.
You may have to buy a headache, even though it’s time for many to grow it.
This cake can only be made from apples if the pear does not want to buy.
Of course, taste is more versatile if the cake rains also its main rhythm.
Sugar apples and pears and remove seed houses.
Cut it out.
It can be closed in the boiler.
Cut the eggs and sugar into foam and then add corn flour and salt to the foam.
Combine corn starch, or corn, as well as bread powder and add dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Crude bread with bread paper, peel 2 food-like sugars on the bottom of the bed and spread the pears on top of the sugar.
He threw half of the magic on top of the headaches, and apple blocks on the dough.
The rest of the magic on the apple blocks.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool down in the bed and then reverse the offer.
Cut the cake just well frozen.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily broken, because the dough has almond and corn flours with no gluten.
Ruka is organised as an international criminal record event in January
Kuusamo Ruka will be held for the first time in January as an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programming numbers, as well as jazz music.
For example, as a guest of the festival’s literature, we see the Swedish Decor Literature star Jens Lapadus and Erik Axel Sund, behind the title of the Swedish language writer Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, writers can also visit Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers in the event represent Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo offer a framework for a unique written experience.
Statussymbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person a popular, charismatic or admirer?
The researchers at the University of Sydney who analyzed the matter have outlined two types of \"cooliousity\" consisting of a few different features: the generally charming coolity and, in that regard, the opposite dissident-coolity.
According to the description of the researchers, the cooles had many socially desired features: they were outwardly oriented, friendly, harmonious and competent.
Again, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion, and a break.
They thirsted for experiences and kept only a little out-of-the-art assessment.
Both types united good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not longer on top of the cool: high status in teenage age may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how the U.S. study published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who had a relationship early, billeted, applied for good-looking carrots and sought to favor others, had an increased risk of using drugs and thinking about crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they were more vulnerable than in the past.
A high status-communication lock of wolves, sign bags or watches does not make a human cool or at least a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with their normal brand shirt than with their clothing – despite the fact that most of them chose a single shirt when they were dating.
If you're on the Greek holiday island, be careful!
There's a storm attacking, a weather warning to scream out of red.
During the weekend in southern Greece can rain as much water as in Finland in an average period of half a year.
The Zorbas storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
Be sure to stay in Peloponnes, the islands of Joona, Kyklada or Creeta.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has provided a red weather warning to the regions.
The nearby storm is also told by weather service on the Forecan blog.
According to this, the toughest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, Finland’s early week piessyt Kusma storm blew at its worst fairs in 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, the greatest concern of the Zorbas storm is, however, not the wind, but the heavy rains.
The weekend in southern Greece can come over 300 millimeters of water.
It is responsible for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has shared the video of the storm development on Facebook.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the man's death in Love Island Finland - Anku?
Shows up with some confusing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that the beautiful Anku, which was killed by several men in the Love Island series, also appears in the strange Youtube video released in 2010.
On video Anku advises askarts to prepare, among other things, the old economic paper roll of the blueberries.
The gift also shows a sympathic style of how tights can be askarre with a smooth to which the right spikes grow.
Now we're putting the Easter dishes to grow, but we're doing it in a bit of a surprising way, Anku's hinting and presenting sahanpura, tights, and the seeds of the grass that he's doing.
You can watch videos below or from Anku Youtube channel here.
Valtter Bottos starred and threw adrenaline in Sotshi, did he become an assistant to Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtter Bottos would be a little longer for ten minutes after the Russian gp balm after he was in front of the media.
A nice tour left behind the Mercedes 1st in Lewis Hamilton and was definitely a critical criticism for the Finnish time spent this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
It feels good, a little bit more, Bottos explained.
I've only been on the stake this year, in Austria (in the middle), so time has passed quite a bit.
This bike has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip the warsh track, so the departure is particularly important.
And of course, Bottas was able to answer whether he was going to win tomorrow, or whether he would be in front of the MM title approaching the Jesation of Hamilton.
My starting point is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There may be no other goal when leaving the boat, Bottas.
But as a stable, we are fighting for both of them.
Lewis' lead Sebastian Vettelin is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so that's to keep in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottts' success after driving, and Mercedes' stable boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed it.
Lewis had a intention to win Valtter, but he didn't succeed in the stop.
The coach knows that he has to tear everything away from himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline broke out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
The question is whether the stable will give Bottaks and Hamilton a fair drive, Wolff replied.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, and we'll see how the race starts.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen achieved the race at the Finnish Championship
The SM series for racing was rarely completed.
It is unlikely that the brothers of Finland have been the champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally in Turku and Salo, the Tusulas Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg, for Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career, while the third place in the final race sealed him with the SM4 category of the Finnish Championship.
The Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, competing at Honda Civic, started the market competition at a level, as the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would return the SM account.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twin had to give a level when some of the extra lights were betrayed by another special test.
There was a bit of shock for the third.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to hesitate.
On Saturday, only the second series of Jussi Tepo was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to pull their troops away.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without any conditions.
Mullem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is near to him.
In his UN speech, Mulelam also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the war that continued for seven years.
More than 30,000 people have died in the war.
Mr Angela Merkel told us on Friday in Germany that in October there will be a Syrian meeting to be attended by the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans viewed the Supreme Court as a judge on TV.
The Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasay Ford, who was accused of harassing him, got an extraordinary number of people on the brink.
In the United States, at least 20 million people received the highest justice judge’s appointment on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California Professor Blasay Ford, accused of harassing him, were in front of the Senate Judicial Committee.
According to preliminary results, the consultations followed six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In order to increase their online consultation, millions more were monitored.
The NBC reported that livesters were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they did their annual record at 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's number rises to over 10 million, according to which you've followed the broadcast through YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million to start.
Digital startups are the own channels, TV screen numbers come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case gorgeous.
Few to over 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only get sports games, as well as the great Oscars and Grammy galleries in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as Presidents’ speeches and presidential claims in 2016.
The most popular annual program in the United States, the American football league for the NFL final match in Super Bowl, is certainly a trip.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress said that nearly 48 million people and 30 million people were employed.
The most important thing
The Supreme Court’s appointment in the United States is an extremely important case, as the authorities are lifelong.
Trump already appointed a new judge when Antoni Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to stop President Barack Obama from calling him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was in several questions the so-called electoral language, which could be resolved by the position of the 9th-minute court.
He was a supporter of the rights of abortion and sexual minorities, for example, in 2015 with his vote that the same-sex-sexs were granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be to lock the right for decades.
Children have the right to receive information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health information of their children from Kanta.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's strange.
In the beginning, the situation of Kanta service was even more worrying: parents did not even have access to small health information or recipes.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for people under the age of 10.
Since then, the use is promised to be repaired, but it has been amazing for a long time.
Now the repair is in order - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an adjudication.
Then, with the understanding of the painting, it is about the press of the button: when the pipe is closed, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his parents his knowledge if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10 years old?
The ID card is paid, and a 10-year-old can't even get a credit card.
In practice, the four-class data of the school cannot be seen by anyone other than by asking them printed.
It is not as much about the right of parents as the right of children.
It is extremely important for the child to be part of it.
Of course, the right to privacy of teenagers must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where all things cannot be talked freely.
Often they are linked to sexual health, from which free care is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the U.S., the FBI started messing with Kavanaugh's harassment charges.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two harassment charges made by women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations of alleged sexual harassment at his time of study.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Judicial Committee.
The study should not take longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, it is a criminal investigation of a cross-border investigation, and it is not necessarily public.
He threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaan
The busy blaster continued to pulsify even in the chamber.
Police report that they put a man in prison for rape.
The police were charged with a suspect offender's threat on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official informs about the case that began when a fair 30-bit man was in a violent dispute at the central restaurant.

When the third party tried, the man still hit him.
The trial led to the call of the police.
The party caught the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police said.
The suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police report that they have sent a man to prison for rape.
The man is suspected of three abuses and violent opposition of the official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start their work in Sulawes, Indonesia - “Puhdas water is the most urgent thing to do.
UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help Indonesia on Sulawes Island, says Kirsi Haru, the Finnish Unicef Information Manager.
Local authorities lead rescue efforts, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to the normal operation, Unicef always has a full emergency, says Haru.
The first task is to find people from ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please in the city of Sulawes rescue measures are underway, but the situation in the Donggala region is a bit more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance is difficult because the roads are also off, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is huge.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection - for the first time, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, it is often possible to provide water purification tablets that Unicef has in stock.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is first transported by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Looking for family members and combining families is part of the Unicef task field.
Food aid is organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
In other words, Unicef has already started a cash collection to help the victims of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami.
Billionion Elon Musk will end Tesla as Chairman of the Board - $20 million fines for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of the companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by contract with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends his mission as president of the Tesla Board and agrees to fines of $20 million.

In addition, Tesla must appoint a new, independent member of its government and take two independent leaders of its management team.
Tesla also needs to set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

The Twiits Mistake Investors
According to SEC, Musk's tweets were misleading investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have provided funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at $420.
Tesla’s stock exchange rate rose by more than 10% a day, but later decreased.

According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawal from the stock exchange with other management groups or the company’s government.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14%, when the security officer SEC announced fraud.
A new agreement is expected to re-confirmed the company’s course.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the clocks of the court don’t ring when the wizards don’t move.
It's a technical error.
The tower of the Church of Helsinki has stopped.
The wizards show at twelve.
The situation is like an average horror film: even when the church's krypta belongs to the manna and the humidifiers would fight for themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it has been broken.
It has been seen by the repairer, but some parts have gone broken, and it is expected to be a new part,\" says Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter Account.
It is said that the last sentence is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen says the bells of the church don't sound bad.
