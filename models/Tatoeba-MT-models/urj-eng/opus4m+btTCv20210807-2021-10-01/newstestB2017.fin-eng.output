The 28-year-old cook was found dead at the Sanfrancisco Shopping Center
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping center portal this week.
The victim’s brother says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Legal Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a crime.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he released San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant, was a kitchen master six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters’ restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
“We’re a small and dense team, like a family. We’re sorry,” the representative said.
“Our thoughts are with Frank’s family and his friends.
Louis Galicia says Frank was first living in the hostel, but he finally had it settled.
“He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“She was a nice and big heart.
His way of being together with the family was to make food for all of us,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was the brother who went with the power.
Despite all the abuses in the world, he was an unbelievably diamond who shined every day,” he said.
Any knowledge of the case is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-555-4444.
Losing junior doctors require new work struggles
Representatives of British junior physicians (which are primarily responsible for specialists in Finland) have invested in their union and requested permission for new work combat measures in a new employment contract dispute.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking for support from its entire government for further work struggles from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not resolved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in July.
58% of the voting members rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, President Ellen McCourt published a letter to the JDC members on Twitter, where he says the government has “witnessed itself,” the questions that McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter reads: “In the light of this, the JDC’s government has, in its vote, rejected a completely new draft agreement and demands that new formal negotiations be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's hardship, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the BMA government, requesting permission for the least-exploited expansion of the work struggle since the beginning of September.
For the reason of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike for six times this year, including the first full job stations ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, head of the BMA Junior Doctors, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members that the agreement was good and that it should be approved. The vote was attended by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said the agreement will enter into force and apply to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in order to settle and complete the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
However, while taking Vladimir Putin against his Turkish official brother, Peter’s palace in the golden hall, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties were able to handle it,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't just drop the heat on his own restraining standards.
Recept Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “good friend, Mr Putin,” a report said five times.
I didn't keep my bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing evil had ever happened.
I was just the opposite of his enthusiasm.
But Putin’s constant delay showed that Russia’s chief did not forget anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time of the event was fierce.
Putin attacked me tightly against Ankara and accused him of stabing his back.
The insult was even bigger because it came from a certain friend.
Getting true trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the state had a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to get the apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all of his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly plagued him.
Sovinno also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey with a strong ban on chartering, as millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be aware of the relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in a late season's attack on the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, the state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall, as Turkish imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
“You were there, tomatoes back here, shaped in the article Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West reacts to the coup attempt.
Without neglecting the old edges of the Turkey EU accession negotiations and the lack of Putin. Putin, which is eager to take advantage of the cool spaces and to disrupt Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, who had his own concern about the exchange of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able to deliver a picture of what was described by an analyst as an outside alliance: two countries that experience being rejected by the West and treated by the shores combine their strength.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have great differences.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Please note that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not discussed the topic at all.
The Turkish President refused to answer the question of differences in the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Considering the possibility of a complete disaster caused by Turkey by NATO’s member state when shooting down a Russian fighter machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hate, these two Heads of State are still speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the RBS bank’s Executive Director, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be cut off in such a way that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. the so-called back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, the brand-runners have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors a million pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But it is now considered right to allow more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a short-term RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, except the headquarters and stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness.
He said to BBC Scotland: “RBS is turning into an investment brand and because of what our staff is working for, because we are now turning a lot more into a different brand bank.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations -rugby, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
“It is now time to turn into a bank with different brands, because the main question is how we can make a bank better for our customers,” says the President of the Bank.
“It would have been very bad three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put in place the brands.
But the work and concentration of our customers’ needs rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win in Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettori showers champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3 000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th victory in the British Championship on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the trail of his own locality.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth Jockey to achieve this milestone in a steady track running competition.
The same has been achieved before by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time masterjockey Dettori, who previously won the Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the ground because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility.
Dettori takes the cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have achieved a milestone in the aesthetic competitions, and they have been masterjockey Richard Johnson and 20-fold master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career more than 4 300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it’s not surprising that she just reached this milestone that only few have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical advances are what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has brought supporters to the species for years.
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 cats if he would not compete only on weekends and only in big competitions!
Speaking seriously, Franke’s horse riding career in the UK has been profitable for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vibrant person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori fanted his achievements in a symbolic way by jumping down his horse's back on a plane.
“From flying targets to flying downs, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
There's a lot of upper and bottoms on the way.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996-Magnificent Seven, but he has survived the flight accident and has been banned due to drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had initial difficulty in starting, but he showed an admirable character strength, looked to his suspects and returned to his best.
And he’s not going to stop his career for a while yet – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue the race until at least 50 years of age.
Putin was distinguished by Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly resigned with his chief of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s believed inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin’s statement, President Putin decided to release Ivanov’s duties as Head of the Russian Presidency, but the reasons for dismissal were not stated.
Anton Vaino, the Deputy Head of Ivanov, has been appointed as Vice President of the Mission since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the Moscow National Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later led the President’s protocol department and the government’s office, the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: “I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as the Head of State, which means that the drafts of law and the supervision of how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had asked himself for a difference and recommended Vaino for his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin, and, like Putin, he has a KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, Russia's government television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only assure a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are they fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious of the official argument that a man who is able to become president wants to suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin in which he says: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very complicated and, to some extent, even difficult job for four years.
Now I have served as President of the President for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as the Head of the Security Service (FSB) of the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was thought that Ivanov could come from Russia after the second season of President Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from choosing for a third period.
However, the mission went to another area of Putin, Dmitry Medvedeville.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – the star of the FBI scientists series, Thomas Gibson, was fired by a producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios branded a series of kicks in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Special Agent, Gibson, had filed an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened, he says in his announcement.
Information on how Gibson’s character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously, in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years,” says Gibson on Friday.
“I was hoping to see it until the end of the series, but it’s not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all screenwriters, producers, actors, great production team and most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for.
The 12th season of production will start in the United States on 28 September.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffic Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banffi, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windmills that have become the world's most iconic of a circular storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres away from the seashore, published a picture of the scene in Periscope and hoped to get the answer to the emergence of these five-centre fish.
Queensferry's crossing is now connected to Fife
The estimated £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry’s crossing bridge to the north deck and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the “cans” which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vinocos.
The estimated £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of State of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the working country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry’s bridge.
We are all witnessing significant progress in building a bridge. More than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The whole bridge deck is now in place of almost 79%, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be raised to its place.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Consultors project, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urinary barrier in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower road deck, then we had to close the rest of the north-west (i.e. the half-earth).
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the north.
This was a massive and, at the same time, a large precision operation.
Massive because the ground has a length of 222 metres and a weight of 6 000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at about 3% angle.
The tolerances that the team had to follow were very small – only a few millimetres.
Everything went very well.
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells us about the wonders of three men.
The three men who had been caught in the water were saved like a miracle in the trade.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 p.m. at a local time in the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim in safety while their boat continued to go out of control.
“We saw the boat orbiting right next to them, and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
“By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, the age of 60, was found to be exhausted as a pick-up, and without a lifeline.
They were all taken to the coastboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men who have been exposed to water are still alive and completely well.
The boat engine had an emergency extinguisher, but for some reason it had broken off the boat from a man of the age.
They had a lot of luck on their way.
Pokémon Go - driven by health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to watch their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people rise from the couch and move.
Originally, it took only a TV watch, then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it's great to see that technology and externality don't shut each other off.
This, of course, refers to Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go is a game application, the characters of which come from a video game created in the 1990s (and later were also made in the cartoon series, playing cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a little before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The lease in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out looking for pokémons with their smartphone, followed by GPS. When you find a pokémon, it can be “photophoto” or “capata”
The wildness has slowed down the video game as a younger generation and raised the back sides of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the average person takes a day.
Washington Post recently announced the Apple Watch Intelligence Cardiogram app, which discovered within two days of the launch that the number of people moving in 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who to play Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the quantities of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, where people are encouraged to rise off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have gone to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have shown themselves to be harmless.
However, the importance of sports should not be reduced.
Regularly moving probability of developing cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokemon Go game is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-friendly things – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
In the course of the hunt, it is possible to even get new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes the plight of the joy-seekers.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
We're done with the break-in.
For even though the Smartphone apps like Fitbit had already been able to track your activity before, they did not, however, give the reason to move forward, as Pokemon Go does.
The news loss disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, more games will be played where applications and virtual reality will be combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the movement of people leaving yachts and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget about jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamite jumps.
Unsatisfying booms.
The jaws will be soaked with permano.
That's great in everything.
And now also the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old teenager won the championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His overall score of 6.2.198 was clearly better than the silver-positioned “Final Five” team member Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aiya Mustafini.
The United States Simone Biles takes part in a women's tennis competition on Thursday in Rio 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman of all time who won the championship, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all time.
Biles teared his tears when his total final point came to the sight and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a whole new dimension and raises him to the same class of sports with other superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been in his species for the last three years. He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic Winner Mary Lou Retton said he was the greatest teenager in all time.
In Brazil, there was still one final competition that took place, above all, between Biles and his own burden and the oversized expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman are hugging gold and silver at the final of the Women's Teen Gym contest in Rio's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on the i team co-ordinated and now retired to Martha Karoly's students.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in the long run, it was not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program, which includes a volt series known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which could well be heard on the streets outside of the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
Her grandparents already have a little adoption and coach Aimee Boorman's mother's mother has become a force figure. Boorman found her when she was on a daycare tour in a gym where Boorman coached.
He has not lost any multiplayer competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning tube is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two tours, it was like a fabrication.
The rest were a boom and a permanto, where Biles is a defender of the world.
He returned to the lead after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the final result at 15.933 points.
Raisman said that when they were waiting for the final points – which was a mere formality – and tears began to appear around the bordering color of the Biles red, white and blue, when the dream of his playbook was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a small revance for four years ago, when he first split into a third place, but then lost his bronze to Mustaf.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, called the team “mum” was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent planes to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old in the past week, with a wide-ranging twitting, now has a completely new meaning:
Police report three music in the car as the victim of a serial killer who had been heard.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre for ten years. The victims sat in a car talking and listened to music when they were shot, according to a police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, a car parked on the streets on June 12, was shot at by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun, and then fled with another car, they said.
The police suspect that the cause of the triple death was probably not a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags and the 2 900 dollars found in the second adult victim's hearing.
The Phoenix police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the death is linked to four attacks previously committed.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
“It is common for the events that they have occurred in the residential areas of the home,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
Scientists don’t want to reveal what made them decide that the attacks are related and that their author is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a statement stating that only half an hour before the death of the gun was reported on the empty open van, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found seals and took a car from the seat of the armchair and the engine space with bullet chips.
The mother of a 6-year-old child who is suffering from microcephalia: “The things are getting better.
Like most 6 years old, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, mothers.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has a microcephalic, or birth-born minor, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuton’s genetic disorder, which he was not aware of when he was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I can’t get out of this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not committed to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it, he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and maybe not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore,” Picciuto said.
Edmund walks with the driver.
Edmund sat down and started the container until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly moving his own pace.
He walks assisted and drives a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and love singing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund’s invented sign, where she means “the song to me.”
“We’re teaching him a sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes the figs invented by Edmund himself.
There may be a number of diseases in the background of microcephalia: hereditary, such as the case of Edmund, or during pregnancy viral infections, such as ash or zicavirus.
There is a lot of variation in the symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people who are infected with the virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by the uncertain future.
“I kept saying, ‘How do we do it?’
What do we do?
He still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in the past, because I don’t think anyone can give it.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by ziavirus.
Things are getting better.
Things are going to be okay.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi States
Louisiana Governor declared an emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread floods. More rains in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers of the Southeast Louisiana and the South Massissipsipin flood over their storms and spread to a large area as a result of heavy rainfalls.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana says that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already on their way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, who informs the Governor of National Security and Emergency Response, tells the Agency of requests for flood vehicles, boats and sands.
According to Steele, only the Tangipahoan County has requested tens of thousands of sands.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday, in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, water may be added to the area from 76 to 27 mm.
In southern Alabama, flood warning was given on Friday, when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, of which both Louisiana, is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to architect Alek Krautmann, many houses on the river may have to be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in the Ascension County are a threat, as flooding rivers slowly empty into Lake Maurepas Lake.
In Louisiana Liverpool immediately south of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River was on Friday at 9 a.m. already higher than ever.
The rescue continued in the districts of Amari and Wilkinson in the southwestern Massissip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and half of his sons, were earlier on Friday, near the Games of Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres away from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He was warned by the other half of his life.
“We got up, and the water came up with a constant feed,” Hansford said.
\"It stretched to my waist...
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high over the 48 years she lived in the area.
Hansford says that he himself and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only swimmer.
The rescue workers had saved all three large army-style trucks and brought them to the fire station at Gloster, where they had to protect Friday.
Regulator Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly, as the heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering the evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information received from the observationist near Livingston that it had rained about 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil has grown strongly after the rains began on Wednesday.
The authorities tell us that because of the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the inhabitants of the County of Tangipaho were forced to be rescued from their homes and that the school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
Robby Miller, director of the district, said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had remained prisoners of the flood.
Evacuateds have been opened for shelters in the cities of Amita and Hammond.
“They get back to their homes when the water starts to retreat,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, almost twenty streets were closed because of the flood, and residents were offered sand jackets to try to prevent the water from entering their homes and the premises of their businesses.
“For the first time we experienced a great flood in March,” says Lacy Landrum, a city government member.
“This flood seems like the same.”
In Mississip, the rain continued flat on the Gulf coast of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of the Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday, there was a report of a house under a handful of floods, but on Friday there had not yet been any information.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods store, Keith Townson, says he lived in Amiten district for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before, and more rain all the time.
A number of bullets on their body are killed by 6-year-old Mahaj Brown from Philadelphia shooting.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia has been shot, who is already the second six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
The parents of the child told me on CBS Philadelphia channel the son was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had a number of shooting wounds in the gums, legs, arms and stomach, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets,” said Delores Melendez, the boy’s grandmother.
“I can’t believe this,” he said.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and several surgery has been done for him.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting his first class at the local sub-level.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
There were also two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The second 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found at the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether the other injured men could be the shooter.
Police scientists told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The event site was filled with arson weapons type seals that come from different types of assault weapons.
“It is quite clear that this was a ongoing battle.
On the street, there were seals on both sides of the road.
There have been several armed fighters in the area, and they have been actively involved in the shooting, Captain Anthony Ginaldi of Philadelphia Police, told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
The arrests have not been made, and according to the hearing, the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second shooting victim in the city this week was a six-year-old girl whose hand was hit by a mistrust in her play on Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabbya and Laurie?
In this name, I call the Women's Olympic Team in the Teline War, and the reasons are more than one.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie- Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The team, which is complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female-skiller has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in line with 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the former Olympics Gabby Douglas rose up as a surprise winner, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterful performance programs.
Simona became a fourth consecutive American who won gold in a women's individual contest.
Aly Raisman won silver.
The views are at the top of such a species, but the same does not seem to be done in the field.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They're five of the last five \"Final Five\", because in the next Olympic team of the Teen Warming, there will be only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karly's last year coach.
The reality is, however, that artificial fitness is a precious sport and gymnastics practice mainly in private gymnastics, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, travels, performing homes, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers, gyms and family members) etc.
The premises of the majority of telecommunications projects are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operation.
The teaching of the Teen Powers takes place in these clubs, and it means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of the gyms.
Simone Biles' coach, Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Haney, have both coached the sport's enthusiasts since they started playing tennis.
We need to organize a more affordable and more accessible training for young girls with enthusiasm for Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own artificial fitness foundation 20 years ago.
In Harlem, my organization has offered a free or affordable opportunity for artificial fitness for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have gained their national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations in my hometown to Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality tennis education for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
Artificial fitness develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings the sustainable benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start adolescence, and it's great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real-girl power you showed when you won the Olympic Gold, and for motivating so many young girls from their backgrounds to start their way to be the most prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to remuneration and working conditions by accepting the renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but the vote on the 37 000 so-called junior doctor, 58% of the specialist doctor, rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt announced plans to get the contract running early and said that the UK public health system (NHS) was not in any country, and that all further delays were harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend practice in order to improve health care during social times.
The president of the BMA Junior Committee Ellen McCourt issued an opinion last night saying: “The junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement. The particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks when the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we need to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to deal with businesses and sometimes not even react in any way.
In spite of the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, withdraw the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new work combat measures.
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting physicians were invited to support the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the UK doctors representing the trade union.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend wage for 54,000 junior doctors who would be involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, appealed to junior doctors that they would not enter new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working measures achieve very little or nothing, but they already create pressure on teams and services operating in extremes and cause concern, anxiety and disruptions to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and the other parties, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of the irregularities.
The workers were eager to continue their positive commitment to other important topics, such as development, flexibility of education, further training from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, study-free and gender pay gap, were a sign of how seriously employees, health education in England and the Ministry of Health want to adhere to agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine that costs $2.40 per day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attacks patients are in use daily for about €2.40 per day when the authorities recommended that it be given to most people and for longer-term use.
Antihypertensive ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) that is part of the UK public health system (NHS) has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack every year, of which a quarter of them recover from a heart attack, or they get a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that accumulates on the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can pass along with the bloodstream and prevent the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
Britain’s AstraZenecan-made ticagrelor, sold with the name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
In today’s NICE guidelines, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg 12 months, followed by a dose reduction of 60 milligrams and a further three-year dose of aspirin is given twice a day.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for Treatment Methods (NICE) says: “Although there is effective disease progression and effective treatment methods to prevent symptoms, even a quarter of those who have a heart attack get a new scene or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
The fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on the quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommended temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the case of bleeding risk, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the political correctness of the atmosphere, the voteivist in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled last year due to corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The political correcting atmosphere led to the closure of the eyes from a widespread electoral crop in Muslim communities, revealing the report of the government published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of the Government, strongly criticises the police, electoral observers and city councils for evaporating their eyes on electoral violence because of their over-indigenousness to ethnicity and religion.
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and the current anti-corruption force figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside voting places to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters should present a identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only tell the name and address of the voter.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be cast into an uninhabited music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
We need to protect more advertisers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for journalists to be given access to the documents of the Government Council and for decisions of informal committees and working groups to be improved.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral violence, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and their culture more widely in local governments,” he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should separate his duties due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The Court held that the Rahman would forever condemn the religious sense of his Muslim community and his silenced critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said to be the basis of his campaign that every believer Muslim had a religious duty to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questioned or sincerely given in such a way that the person voted by acting as another person.
Sir Eric said the evidence was found in the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-voicing plant, where members of the high Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote on the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made several proposals to clean the voting system, including the need for a identity certificate at the voting place.
The report says: “There is evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been stressed to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, especially those in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
“It was a concern that... the government institutions had closed their eyes from such an activity -- politically correct, due to the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion,” he said.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean the system, including banning the processing of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent the \"sound harvesting\".
The report of Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Considering the options in which voters would be required to submit a identity certificate before voting.
Distinguishing your fingers into an uninhabited music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Refusal of handling of posted sounds and mail envelopes by posted mail from political activists.
The police have the right to form security chains around voting places.
Amendment of the Act thus making it easier to raise intimidation charges under the 1983 Declaration of the People Act.
Refusal of photography at voting places.
Only allow English at voting places (except Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure that staff control rules allow only one person to go to the voting copy at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it amazing that after the case of Tower Hamlet, no criminal charges were raised.
“The election court distinguished Mr Rahman and his representative from his role as a result of corruption and numerous unlawful practices,” he said.
“He was found guilty without a certain suspicion and criminal evidence threshold exceeded many grounds.
He also criticises the inefficient punishment checks of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
“The decision of the Court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a awakening,” says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its inheritance as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation threatens the worrying and hidden election and its denial by some people.

The fans of Rio 2016’s Olympics were wild this week from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose equal appearance with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete in the championship who has an opportunity to compete with a known person.

A lot of people have also noticed the unity of Kerri Wash-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's smiles and the gold won the gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna returns!
The CBC Olympic Commander asks to apologize for the Chinese swimmer’s death as a pig.
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth instead of women’s 4 x 200 metres free-to-use message, CBC’s direct Olympics surveyed viewers were launched on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcasting company, CBC, has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer’s loss of sharks and dead as a pig.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to launch his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-metre release message final.
MacDonaldi, who was included in CBC’s explanatory notes, was heard to say: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, went fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to swim into China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language usage of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig??”
The idiot didn't realize he was still in the embassy.
The Chinese Ai Yanhania, who slept at the end of the 4 x 200 meter free-mail, was described with the following words: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with angry comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
Twitters didn't arrest their words when they heard how uninterested Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC’s shipment, quickly complained about MacDonald’s words: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened.
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his regret to over 90 other tweeters’ comments, which complained about McDonald's speech.
The TV company also made a public apology.
“We are sincerely sorry, these statements and the fact that they were sent.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also asked for an apology to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be complained, and Byron is very sorry for his words.
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret in sending and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
“I want to apologize for my comment that I gave last night after women’s communication,” McDonald said at the CBC Olympics.
“I took a swimmer to perform, not a person.
Without saying it is clear that I did not mean anything to be degraded by my words, and I am very sorry.
In Primark, a woman in the middle of a trade was shocked by customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman got into the middle of Primark to match underwear.
He continued to worsen the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually tried four underwear pairs at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at Folkestone Bouvere Place, where a woman tried underwear for everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother Jenny Davidson, who was in the store, says that when she tried underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says: “People were not to believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the trade, took the underwear off the shelf, took her own triks, and her underwear, and put them on top.
He didn’t try to do it unnoticedly, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone looked at him when he took out of his feet and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided that he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes, and he didn't think about a person who would eventually buy underwear he had experienced.
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: “How amazing to think someone will take the underwear that someone else has used and is not washed.
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I have understood that the trade staff sought to remove those items of clothing from the sale after the woman had left – what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has experienced them without being washed up, more Davidson.
Primark’s spokesman commented: “Primark is aware of the situation in Folkestone’s movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale.
This is how you defend yourself against armed attack with Krav Mag
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master Rhon Mizrachi in New York and asked for advice on how to cope with the pyssy in the near distance from the pyssy-cracker or the assaultist.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you or behind you.
If the attacker approaches behind, the first thing you need to turn around is to see the attacker and get out of the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder arm, and strike the attacker on your face with a free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee to the nails, and when he goes to the pain of a two-factor, put him on the face with a gun's pipe and relapse by holding the gun as directed to him.
The technology is the same if the armed attacker approaches the front. You need to move off the firing line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your pressure on the weapon and hit the attacker with a bow on the chest. Turn the gun away from the front of the attacker, retreat and keep the gun targeted for the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video of how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that you are the safest person to get rid of the kidnapper by giving up your cash – unless you are the Grand Master of Krav Mag.
Ian Wright, the world traveler from the travel guide, licks Europe’s dirtyest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and chaos reflexes on a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most offensive places in Europe.
Suffolk's runner and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking the strength of the euro banknotes, handbag Picccadilly Circus, train toilet humidifier and Russian general phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on the snowometer to see themselves and to show the viewers where they were banned from pushing.
The test was carried out by the documentary Ian Wright – on the tracks of internal power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking a train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen the good bacteria of the intestine and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused nothing but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright became initially known for his travel program, where he tested the durability of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The sinking of rail stations' handrails and toilet looting machine was no doubt challenged by Wright's resistance.
Wright says in a document: “I’ve been very concerned about my health since I was a child and put all kinds of stuff in my mouth, such as mud, worms and curvatures.
In the film, he actually showed his reputation as a tax.
The border was only received in a broken public toilet in Russia.
Luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison purposes, it should be stated that the number in the opposite hands is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the snowometer measured 4,000 units – the same figure in the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright, together with Valio, explores the documentary Ian Wright – on the tracks of inner power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in a document: “This is almost the smell of a camel that I smelled in any toilet.
4,000 units, nothing's dirtyer than that!
This place is so amazing that I really don't eat anything here.
Wright produced a documentary film with Ian Wright – the traces of internal power in collaboration with Valio.
From the selection, Wright received a selection of lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D vitamins from Valio Gefilus, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the category of snack, juice and novelty products in the selection, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and we finally decided to ask Ia to.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor.
Tom Hakala, directed by the film, adds to this: “We are told that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we were asking for, such as a pampering Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some of the items, while part was pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape.
In a survey conducted in 2015, 84% of respondents included lactic acid bacteria in particular for the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% reported that they had at least at the time used products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The wedding family was destroyed before his wedding house in Saltashi, Cornwall
The family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the city to own the rental house after they had received the wedding due to the terroristisation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have received a wedding after numerous complaints against the couple in Cornwall, Saltashi.
Once the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental rental company found themselves shocked by the apartment being repaired.
On the wall there were amplifying holes, the floor boards had been torn off, the trash had been spread to the floors, and the walls were clogged with graffiti.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says he's afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: “This has been a nightmare for people living here, no one should have to endure this.
There is a lot of red tape in this case, as the property is likely to be known as not so pleasant as the Cornwall.
The family is evil, just like its name.
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's power to practice terror included roofings in baseball countries, home residents' intimidation, drug use and communication, as well as loud rumors, quarrels and torture.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received an order for non-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the fountain threat.
The house had previously sold drugs, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family had a fight on the street and the police had to play regularly.
Cornwall's apartment agency married the couple for forced action this week after giving them the first 11 weeks of additional time to change voluntarily.
They were grateful for the wedding – they said their lives were the earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, “They didn’t care about anyone.
We have lived next to them for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times.
“We didn’t get to sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been married.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
Roski and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It’s a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for the behavior of his or her family, because the wedding is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been shocking to the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who took part in the work and offered courage to provide us with information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of the neighbours and give a message that social behaviour is not accepted.
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment in different times, but they were already in twenty.
House one bedroom after wedding found dirty mattress
The housing workers now need to clean the waste plants around the house.
The police made the house in 2014 a race and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and, in addition, wax and other supplies as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine penalty when he was found guilty of possession of class B-huumes to sell it.
He claimed that the money was in his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told to move to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were buried on graffiti.
Police say they demand a wedding for tenants who violate the rules of lease contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this wedding is a clear warning for tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want to do without accusations, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and social behavior and continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-floored, beach-sleeved military jet scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in the Portuguese Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed into an alarming low plane.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to flee when the jet flying down the hill hit over the full beach.
The dramatic images show how the military aircraft will be almost in touch with the sandy beach from tourists taking the sun in North Portugal’s Aveir.
Holidayers rose to their feet with concern about the steepness of the jet engines, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of the dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: “It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling into the ground.
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me.
The tourists on the Aveiro beach experienced a shock when the plane suddenly appeared and flew down at an alarming low level.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight aimed at identifying the coastal fishing vessels, which was why the aircraft had to be so low.
According to the pilot, they had to be slightly lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to the visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility of the sand fog and smoke, the pilot had to be so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
The social and health border in South Karelia (Exote) made a better result of the planned EUR 3.4 million in January.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Exote seeks to shorten the rules of action.
Exote covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The Board of Exote will discuss a half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guards swore by a military light in Immolola
70 guards at the Border and Sea Guard School swore a military light on Friday.
The military election was held in Immolola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Legislature course whalery was held in the sports field of the reserve.
The military oath was made by 70 men.
Special border guards are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, a special frontier man was picked up by 310 young people.
They were called 250 for selection tests.
Special frontiers have been trained in Immolola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the meeting of veterans.
The average age now is 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of roses ahead of the crime investigation will help investigate crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been a RTA or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
The Häme police department includes four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by the Sergeant Lahti.
He's the chief officer in Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian person engaged in information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, according to Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different reports for the other police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of recent working practices
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the police’s working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police would leave more and less often the pills in the place of the wars only when they were alarmed.
Through the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established, fewer than three national units and each police station, with its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas shared by police departments, and have the task of providing information to both local police and national services.
Knowledge extends beyond its own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is responsible for knowing what is happening throughout the police department.
It also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because it also makes crime.
Those working in RTA have more basic ICT skills.
The unit seeks to attract police attention to new phenomena, product-like criminals or similar crimes through registers, alert task databases and observations.
This is called sacrament, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the work done, the factor is made up of a certain kind of image.
It can be done either on the basis of an act or person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals learn their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city with the collars standing, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals are not described as their own, because it could lead to the development of professional criminals and thus seek to prevent police crime-attacking companies.
The police will publicly report the conduct if it predicts a threat to them.
Such a case was, for example, the initial news, the labelling of empty housing used in housing breaks.
In it, the authors put the apartment on the outer door of the stick, a tie needle or a tape with which they tried to see if the inhabitants were really on their way.
The pre-research material shall be publicly available to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever ordering protocol on the right to fly, for example, may indicate that fingerprints have been found in the place.
The next time we steal, we leave the gloves in the hand.
The case has been interviewed with Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Officer Arto Tuamela from the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information to design practical activities.
Guarantee the reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of your institution and Finland.
The London school girl who joined her father was killed in Syria.
The news tells us that one of the three British school students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasime Akunjee, tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria in Raqqq a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike to Raqqqa, which is the Isis base in Syria, ITV News said on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and his family said he was planning to flee from the country and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that this will act as a warning example and a testament, so that people can understand this as a real risk to the war zone, and that makes people leave the decision to leave,” says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, together with two other Eastern school girls, went on a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis fighter in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
The Senate's Democratic President Harry Reid says he's convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will be appointed Judge of Merrick Garland's Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland’s appointment after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate’s majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will select a person to fill the place of the former Supreme Court judge Antonician.
Reid said in the phone conference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton's choice of Garland with great certainty.
Reid's reporter later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland, and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “cry the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans that block Garland's name are the presidential candidate for Donald Trump's hands-in-laws.
He said Trump didn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as to men
The Treats magazine co-operates with photographer David Bellemere and puts on the market the calendar of Pirelli’s inspired calendar in the 1970s.
Instead of postings, they want to find the top models of the next generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from the old school's Playboy magazine because he said, \"Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently he thinks the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classical nakedness where women, where men, too, can easily enjoy and inspire these pictures of the women’s body,” says Shaw’s calendar in a press release.
Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.
For a model, you can send pictures via the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys disks?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on the name of your angry objection to the EiväKikThe Middle Ages, this statement is based on real research data.
According to YouGov’s research company, behind the new arrival of many vinyl plates, there is no boom in the millennial generation, when the millennials want to feel physical object in their hands, but instead have a medium-age nostalgia.
The age of the person who recently bought vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18-24 of the age group are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just a desire for enthusiasts to hug discs, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl disc buyers prefer to hide their emotions (56% v 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% v. 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog had been broadcast on television, the camera would follow me along my walk from a lively Soho Street, on top of my jewelry grey jacket. I would sincerely, bend my hand into a cup and say something about tradition, like, “Let’s see, let’s find out,”
Let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and its rosity when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs own facilities, there are still a handful of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to the men who visit these shops and try to evaluate their age and nature.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (as customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (as customers at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-seven women) are on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spend extra time visiting the offer of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
“I think I am,” he says.
“I have about 3,000 to 1,000 albums.
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly his available income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared in the beginning, and to buy again the things he had been young and financially forced to sell.
“I have a lot of things from the late 60s and from the beginning of the 1970s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” he said.
He agrees that those buying vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their company, and more: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much.
It's my evil...
Wez, 25 in Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers will match the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new form of human flow, which has been influenced by the media, and these people have heard of the arrival of vinyl plates and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“On the basis of my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy their vinyl back, he says.
This can explain the boom of certain-age vinyl-heriting booms.
What about the emotional significance of audio discs?
In just a few seconds, he realizes in a movement like Phonica that they offer comfort to the same kind of people in the community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly affected by a non-contact payment system.
The digital world may be ashamed of some vinyl fans to whom the return to familiar disc boxes means durability and reminds us of youth’s happiness.
“I believe that it sometimes fills up a hole or material property for some comfort,” Wez said.
“I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It is an easy way to get thoughts elsewhere.
“We are like social workers,” says Wez’s associate behind the record surface.
The ICM opinion study in April revealed that almost 50% of those purchased in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The poll also reported that 41% have a disc player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl disc buyers do not have their own disk player at all.
At this point, the news broadcast would probably look like a serious face while I turned the stacked bosa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by a “pocalypal phenomenon” by the salesman Jonny, who, at the moment of the Sounds of the Universe movement (the customers of the three middle-aged men), has discovered.
“The client recently released and said he didn’t have a record player, but he wanted to buy a Radiohead disc so he could put it on his shelf,” Jonny said.
“The proportion of these customers is not large, but they are.
For them, materialism is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby.
The customer community is significantly more varied in Foppi, where I arrive next. The business has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
There are 70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
The difference between customers will delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: the sound of sounding a bang instead of the swing jazz Wild Beats' newest sex with a synthesizer pop.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to find a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various discount discs.
He's more watching than doing shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
They cost a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from your computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is...
“I can’t explain, they’re so unique.
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a group of teenage girls who would think they'd be jumping jeans, but instead, they're gathering for a moment around the Polaroid cameras, and I see a father and a daughter who's considering buying a Crosley disc.
On the left, there is a staircase filled with allelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key plates in any middle collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just a interior element and a part so high that they are not even promoted.
They are pure-art vinyl.
But given that all the ways to get attention to these albums may mean more money in the industry and send some customers to the hacking Sohoon, there is hardly any reason to complain.
It is not surprising that a population group, most likely to have more time and money than most, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research shows that the results of YouGov are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not, however, exclude a large number of female players and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely stuck in school or in working life.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday mornings in record stores on Berwick Street, browsing the plates and avoiding 30-year-olds who play a TV driver, who look scaryly and look at unwittingly middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice cream, is the longest live vertebrate – video report
According to researchers, the planet’s longest-lived vertebrate is ice shark.
According to Haifier Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice cream for the age of 272 to 512 years was found in the study, with a five-metre female.
The French Court rejected the application for the removal of the goods of the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they require the removal of tens of temporary shops and restaurants by housing thousands of refugees in jungle camps.
In the case of legal proceedings held this week, the Calais authorities submitted claims that the State should be allowed to break down the 72 temporary shops created for refugee camps. Trades sell various goods to refugees in tobacco drinks and offer hair clips. The temporary restaurants can buy tea with 50 cents or basic meals in a few euros.
According to Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene attacks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals offered by a state-backed organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food to those who need them.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal justification for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concern of Calais’s prefect to be fully understandable.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s food shops, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just offering food to people who live in extremely unstable conditions.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the landing threat was the camp Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of people without guardians, with the most vulnerable status.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where children’s café is required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, closing it would be a disaster for those children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Two charities of charity, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimates Friday that after the steep growth of the summer fires, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record of over 9,000 lives.
Food prices in Finland are considerably faster than average in the EU.
In Finland, food fades sharply to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of tea has decreased by almost 5% in Finland in three years, with an average price of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the highest number of EU countries with a similar level of pay than in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The data are published in the Information & Trends blog by Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland.
The page compared real wages, i.e. prices that have been linked to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the price level of 1994.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now the import ban imposed by Russia, which has sparked food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also contributed to the decrease in prices.
The large trade chains of the S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
The consumer has seen the price competition as prominent advertising campaigns.
However, Finland still does not have cheap nutrition styles, even though the price of food has decreased.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland for EU countries with a similar wage level in Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on the value added tax.
He found that if the Verrocco countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from similar countries.
Finland compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the rate of VAT would be seven in the vertical countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be half the average level of EU countries and continued price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
The Commission notes that the calculations made by him in the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
The school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all undergraduate schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan shows the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, teaching beauty writing is given up, and instead schools begin to practice coding.
Sweden’s education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher taught students, but now everyone should be active and learn each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting spine found - ice cream can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland hai (Somniosus microcephalus) known for icebergs reaches the age of 150.
It can live after 250 years, report a new study.
The figures make the species the most long-lasting spine in the world.
In the animal kingdom, it only passes the Islamic Empire, whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507.
Greenland's sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimetre per year has been observed, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen, from Copenhagen University, found out.
He set the age of adults’ ice creams from 28 females who had remained in fishermen’s fishing gears.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbon age of the eye lens.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish, 493 and 502 cents of amateurs, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
In previous studies, it has been found that ice-colds only reach a depth of more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fires for almost 300 - no salesmen are reduced
Almost 300 employees are fired from Stockman.
The joint venture companies ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant,” Stockmann said in his statement.
It says that the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann’s yt negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
At the start of these reductions, some 380 employees were estimated to be employed.
The reduction will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which will be expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining profitable goods.
Although the group’s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
Stockmann vs. CEO Lauri Veijalainen said that sales in commodity stores have not reached the company's goals.
“It is unfortunately essential to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018-2018,” says Veijalainen.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly a good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best turnover and result of the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the total operating result of Stockmann was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s sales of this year will decrease last year.
The operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature of less than 20 degrees across the country
The centre of the low-grade material on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rained on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist of the HS.
In the middle of the country there will also be rainfalls, but the southernmost is pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees will remain.
Kenya’s general sports team is treating the dopingsandal - coach’s pace with a peculiar explanation
Kenian general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from Rio's Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as an athlete in the county team in a doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete, in which Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan National Team, said that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had provided a sample of Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities of Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use, Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked last year in the World Cup on the way to the fourth and has premiere Rio winners.
According to Reuters, the source within Kenya’s general sports team claimed that Anzrah was going to the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race.
When antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to be revealed, the source said.
Where is everybody?
the Rio General Sports Stadium
Where is everybody?
At the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least not following the general sport.
On Friday, Rio started fighting for the medals of general sports, but the world’s top figures were able to present their skills to a confusing empty audience.
Rio’s organisers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day’s morning contests and 65% of the tickets for the evening contests have been sold.
It was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulsating people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
Rio’s Olympic viewers have attracted attention even before the general sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty blades in the eyes of rugby, noise and riding.
When Brazilian medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach flying ball in the legendary Copacaba, only 70% of the watch was full.
After the Brazilian taxi, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people were in sight.
At least the fact that Brazil that is struggling with economic difficulties is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match for the Brazilian football team was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
The reporter, Mario Andrada, said on the weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
“There are 1.1 million remaining to be sold,” Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million flags of London’s Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the flags cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
In London’s Olympic volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species in the school country, such as golf and rugby.
In Rio Stadium, there were empty places in the morning.
Even the beach balloon in the Copacaba sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Hallo competed in London in 2012.
The crowds are enough for the newspapers.
New way to protect nature - Get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation will participate in the conservation of nature through the newest means.
The foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and communities can redeem the rights of holders in the country by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into traps that the loved ones can acquire against the payment of the holder’s right.
The fisher receives 187 square metres of his stock of veto, which in practice means that each holder does not require approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire administrator rights for several blocks.
Getting control is something concrete that can leave your inheritance or give you a gift.
You don’t have to go to the banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, the Juha Levivi fabric, which has acquired the right to control your company, is justified.
The holder of the management right receives accurate location data from his or her block, which enables, for example, a visit on the block.
On the website of the Foundation, the name details of the holder’s rights are provided on the same map as the country’s block data can be found.
The only risk of its nature conservation acquisition is that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a foundation of general interest designed to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way in an ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas in such a way that they can be inviolable and peaceful way.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It is primarily financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also aims outside the borders of Finland and plans land acquisition from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Commercial Office on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves torture the great cities of Turkey - see the situation in your home
Bicycle thieves torture Turkey from the great cities of Finland.
This year, the population has been stolen in proportion to more wheels than in nine other major cities.
Helsinki Sanomat explained the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities, and their parts per thousand inhabitants, as calculated in January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, the tip rose to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti.
According to the police, there were four out of five bicycles per thousand inhabitants.
Only about two bicycles per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
That's a big difference.
“In other cities, there are a number of thefts in proportion to others,” police officer Tommi Reen, the police officer.
I wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The generality of the laws can affect how much the city is moving and how much the wheel is at all,” said the Sergeant Teemu Äkäus.
The police government, Tommi Reen, is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
There is a close center in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city, where city centers are remote and the bicycle is not necessarily a primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police have become slightly less wheel thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of the year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 wheel thefts every year.
It means 50-60 each day and only around 4,000 wheels per year in Helsinki.
“They’re big amounts,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few victims report theft to the police.
Reen invites people to make a crime report about the theft of the bike, even though less than every 10 cases reported to the police.
A typical, well-established bike theft is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The benefits can also be found in the context of other investigations, when, for example, the apartment in the drug case can find stolen wheels,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught weekly by themselves or in connection with police investigation, says Timo Leppämämäki.
He said the wheel is stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoor pots, warehouses, and wheelchairs, in practice, from everywhere they are generally stored.
Most of the individual bike models are stolen in the past few years as well.
The U-lock gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheel ends up selling through, for example, the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not come to the attention of the stolen wheels to go abroad,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheel are ordinary Finns.
Some of you will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be accurate, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or offence.
“The alarm bells should be played if the 16 wheels are sold to a clear area,” Reen says.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries a colorful Nopsa for his working day at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
She has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, Hirvi says. “It has never been taken, it’s been a good monk.
“Though this is not so attractive to thieves, it is not necessarily a hypsterical value,” he said.
In Helsinki Kallio, Siiri Valve, who quickly dealt with his bike, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stretched against the wall of the rail, but usually Valve locks his bike on something fixed, like a wheelchair.
“There is quite a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” the Helsinki student says about his white bike, which the body alone paid about five hundred euros.
“Every time you hear from your friends that the wheel has been taken,” he said.
\"Mostly bad wheels, such dirty boys...
The bike was stolen from the house company a year ago.
However, the wheel had been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be used.
Under 15 years of responsibility for his crimes?
Helsinki is testing the United States-known peer-reviewing crews
In Helsinki, we will try the so-called peer-light crew to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
First, the experiment is applied to people under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The Vertais White Team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss the crime with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer-review crew in order to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter written to the family, for example, explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are guided in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes wrong with the first mistake,” the Institute said.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been introduced to the Vertaisval crew.
The idea is that after his first crime, young people do not face an adult panel, but reflected on what happened to people around the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Ikka Lovio, who followed the trial, explains that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on the road you chose,” Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalam crew is part of the Helsinki project of migrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all people who need them, not only to the migrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
The United States newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is directed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his infidelity, incompetence and record indiscriminateness threaten to bring to these elections a sound curve,” says Politico.
Only the movement of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump's decorative anchor in their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is meant to be sent in the next week.
Among the undersigned are politicians Gordon Hubphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the individuals in the letter’s organization is known to be Trump’s opponent of the Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress,” and that is not the support of anyone.
The book lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which believe millions of voters to be trapped.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for the children of the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policies on Thursday night.
I want to be president so that the U.S. economy can go well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by a rich tax increase, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-in-hand for the American duunas who suffer from the relocation of the factories to the countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-payed jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it has to pay the income tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“I object to all trade agreements that work against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to the speculations published before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it was only a millionaires like this.
Trump's proposed race from discount to corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called \"Trump Porsaan\".
On Thursday Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
Such are Rio's viewer figures: Cats haven't glued Finnish tracks, but mobile app is interested in
Usually sports games are shown in television viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached the highest number of viewers.
On one occasion, the races have glued 12% of the population at their best: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Yle Olympic channel at the same time.
Due to the comparison, the EM Games of the month ago received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2, and the EM Games of football were fairly another million.
The Olympics have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Top Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and reminds us that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time in Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
On the TV side, the viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports games to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in the 2012 London competitions or in the 2008 Beijing contests, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s shows will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lazy interest - if someone thought it to be lazy - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the beginning, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, the general sport is just beginning, as is the case with other Finns interested species: sailing and riding.
The numbers of the first viewers have been close to the expectations of Pokkisen.
When the general sport starts, the viewers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which emerged in Apple App Store on the first days of the competitions.
By Monday, the application was downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd like to make sure we're on the road to 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the world’s viewers later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have received updated versions that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more widely displayed in Yle channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
On the Yle Fem channel you can track some species, and on the radio, Yle Püe transmits the races every day.
The Olympics are not only the most laborers of Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be traced from Yle's channels.
Since 2018, the Olympics will be visible on both the Yle and the commercial channels.
How deep is the lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland’s deepest lake is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical utility trainer, found a pressure of about 20 square meters from the Cross, the bottom of which the diving computer showed 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Centre tried to strengthen the observation by evaporating.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says Jari Hakala, a development engineer.
To date, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisvesi, and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“It could well be found in unknown depths,” Kannela said.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
In this way, your Sun will not reach ten deepest groups, and Suvasvesi will be even further away from the tip.
Decoration on 12 August at 14:29: Fixed last piece where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Ihainen from the tax sector: The tax on pensioners is still tighter than the tax on pensioners.
The tax on pensioners is still tighter than the wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the incident came out under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
This is not included in the presentation of the Board of Directors.
We think it should definitely be.
The promises given should be followed after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter heated the opposition representatives in the parliament, who exacerbate the election promises of the Secretary of State Alexander Stubb.
The purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petter Orpon, tax reductions are mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, since next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the willingness of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally).
He says that keeping the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government period.
It has been done with the power of labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much in favour of domestic demand and people’s own future faith.
In the event of prolonged unemployment
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it would seize long-term unemployment in the budget, at least to halt its growth.
In June, long-term workers were around 17,000 more than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of increasing employment rate is 72% run away.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people died in the bomb attacks in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy invites Finns in the country to monitor and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists who intend to travel to Thailand do not need to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy’s instructions for caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel to Thailand is scheduled for one year.
Most of Thailand travelers come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, there is no record of the attack.
The ambassador assumes that events may be associated with the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the Constitutional Treaty of last week's referendum.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people who declared themselves opposed to law were arrested in the country.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, however, there is a conflict with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a great local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He said the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the day’s course so that the authorities are very accurate about safety.
Thailand Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are local sabotage and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of Finland, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two bombs exploded in the paper at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
In both double bombs, at least one died.
In addition, at the village of Surat Than, and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known for many tourists, as it is through it to the Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of the military train in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he said to reporters.
According to Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finns in the country to monitor and avoid the most urgent tourist areas as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who intend to visit Thailand do not need to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the care of the high-speed guidelines, says Westphalen.
Europeans injured
The attacks and their victims in Finland during the night are known very little.
Last night's hit in Hua Hin has been able to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch, and Austrian.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded with a watch tower that was known as a sight.
Thai PBS says that the police have isolated Hua Hin in the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower caps, according to the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There is at least one wound.
The Chief of Police, interviewing CNN, says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded every half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won a women’s four-game match
Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russian Alija Mustafina with the third 58.665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still looking for tennis championships in Rio's competitions with permanno, hyy and boom.
Biles has ruled women’s power in the last few years.
He had eight personal World Championships from the last three years.
He has won the championships of the four matches and the perms three times in a row, and in the last and second years.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two teams of world championships.
The darkest MM-metals in the Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism\"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will be followed by anything more wonderful, the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia will evaluate Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thaimata’s experienced tragedy.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these previous tourists haven't escaped the tourists, this is hardly the case.
Huovila’s company office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's feast in Thailand.
The Patong atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open about 10 o’clock at local time.
A lot of people had not even heard of attacks.
In half three days, Thailand’s time at Patong was normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila at the attack site.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party discovered two men who were fit for the impressions hidden in the near sixth place.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership change: Clear deportation
On Friday, Russia had the highest level of leadership change in the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from collecting too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of leadership tasks is one of the ways in which power is exercised.
This is a way of preventing people from becoming independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in contact with other executives or screwed up.
The Loss of Ivanoville
Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s internal border, will move on to the specific tasks of environmental and transport affairs.
On the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed that Vanoa replace, Russia told Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro notes that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi, from the Institute of Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change its vicinity younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarbulus.
The Arab and Kurdish tourists received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij last week.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city.
I corrected the previous news at 19:30 p.m.: Previously, we said that the civilians were running from the city, really the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's Documentary Policy is unlawful
The line of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the publication of documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that documentary publication cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the internal minister's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the guidance of the Government’s Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Ministry’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister’s Communication Director tells STT that there is a need for a reform of practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under valuables.
He violated his coats from the early days and had to leave the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in a much better condition.
I've practiced well and it's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included small-scale shampoos and fans.
Porina Bolt's bottom line is that the Jamaican star has risen as a period of time when the general sport has struggled with doping scandalals and a relaxing interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he retired at the beginning of 200 metres in time at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and loose your exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors in spite of the end-of-the-end celebration of 969.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin’s World Cup, Bolt reached his career at a lawpoint at the clock.
World record in Berlin on 9.58 hundreds and 19.19 two hundred are still in force.
In Rio Bolt, he has announced that he is seeking 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds of service, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt itself.
In Satas, Bolt’s very challenging is Athens’s 2004 100-year Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost the final of the values once if he has only made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final left Bolt without running because of a flash flash.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the young men's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The final goal of the career, Bolt, has set the next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18 has provided a positive doping sample in Rio’s Olympics.
Chinese U.S. Chen Xiny's doping show found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian drinkers Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenian general sports coach was sent to your home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was ranked in Rio for a quarter in women's 100 metres butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadato, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sports.
Xinhua says that the Xiny exhibit on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also appeared in Rio.
BBC announced that the Bulgarian female drink Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia has, on the other hand, sent Rio home to the general sports coach because of the doping crisis.
The International Olympic Committee KOK announced on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had become an athlete in the test and had provided a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass for 800 metres of runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will not stop anything - historical gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps ui 200 metres mixed in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic Gold in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion for the second time before China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC Olympic Commander Helen Skelton laughs at the night of a quick interview.
Helen Skelton (i.e. on Monday) is the most popular story of this week on the website of the Evening magazine.
Next to the commenter, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t have much stress if the som or the British magazine has a small fit for his revealing and special outfits.
The television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has dressed in high-ranking shoes and short-sleeved dress, which certainly has at least enough visibility - at least for the eyes of a lot of conservative British soldiers.
However, the rear steps are not permitted.
It's important to look good, and small cases are just a fun thing.
Skelton wants to scare and maybe be ashamed, but he emphasizes that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the case has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do things and how big sacrifices they make is for me, Skelton is refreshing.
You know what?
It's a mess of nothing if it comes from dressing (a driver).
I'm a little interested in this if you've hit someone's radar.
Rio's police arrested two suspects for a terrorist suspect.
The Rio Police announced on Thursday that it had arrested two people for the suspicion of terrorism.
The police arrested the competitions in case of security surveillance.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 website, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, whose members were arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have contacts with the Isis extremist organization.
The arrests were known to have led to violence in social media.
The messages called for violence had been distributed in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's competitions is equivalent to 85,000 police officers.
Police exploded a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball and locked the place out of the audience.
The police let the public in after a controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics, when the police have completed a controlled explosion mission.
The police closed the arena for a suspicious package.
The public got in when the police were controlling the package.
The public did not record the game by the beginning of the game, because the police closed the arena to the grave because of the suspicious package found.
The police exploded the package, and only after it was released by the public administration.
The bag woke up the competitions dreamfully started the Spanish team.
With two defeats, the contests began Spain won the Nigerian score from 96-87.
In the previous two competitions, Spain achieved silver.

Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty viewers.
Argentinian lady dressed in Pejaja-Siren - the Finnish reflector of the protest
Tuuli Petja-Siren had a colorful race day in Rio.
Tuuli Petja-Sire experienced hard Thursday.
Argentina's lady dressed Tuuli Pejari-Siren on Thursday at Rio at the Women's Surfing Day opening party.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted a breach.
He was stuck because of the cholari, and the others ran away, the Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete thought for a long time.
It was not worth doing then, because it would have been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could get a refund, Petja-Sire said.
The Finnish was hanging on his desk until the last, because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finnish was left with the colar to leave the 27th.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympics are eight.
There was little effect on the throat.
Friday is an important day when 10-12 will be played.
According to the first data, Pejaja-Sire did not make a protest.
7 special things that, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are ways that affect the health of a person directly or indirectly so that his life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring him extra years.
Such are, among other things, a tendency to moderate body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong age.
You don't always have to scratch the milk bottle.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
Medical Daily introduced seven strange research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
The Harvard University study found that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to the risk of reduced death, especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of alcohol, research shows that the use of justice - one of the three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinks were older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of the toothline can prolong the life of a person for up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
However, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person’s life.
Over 54,000 people watched the project last seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when sex protection is taken into account, is a good thing for health according to many studies.
In addition, it can extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will bring additional years, it will not be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute solidarity.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big back, cholesterol levels were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combines these issues with a lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete or Oscar who won the Olympic medals, he was more likely to live longer than usual bully.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to an additional year.
Some researchers again suspect that a long period of age is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, enables for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour of over 65 years of age found that a person who was shopping daily, or likely to become older, is likely to be shopping less often.
This is due to the fact that the circulation in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping has no effect.
Umpihman Ratty Jumped Towards a Truck
On Friday night, there was a heavy truck and a nokka trailer in the passenger car.
The accident took place in Koske, mid-Friday between Kosken and Sorvaston.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came against was on the same lane, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the crash, the truck remained on the side of the street, but exploded.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The passenger car shut down and then over the door to the roof.
The woman who carried the car in 1972 remained in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University Hospital in Turku.
The results of the women’s blow test were 2.02 promises.
He's suspected of a serious race.
Posti sent paper to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s loose sheet selection had flaws, as the post had accidentally delivered some of the load to the Wall.
On Thursday, Teija Haltia in Pernisto was buying bulk cartons from Salon K-Citymarket, when she hit a funny sign in her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in bulk, because the Posti delivered our load to the Wall River!
We will receive more when Posti is delivered!
If you don't fall in the lawn, it's locked in the sign.
The chaining sign to the trader is related to the extension of the Posti’s last spring services to the lawn mower as well.
Ruohonlekukukukuku is available at the Post until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mainly interesting and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the air.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, more than 700 divisions were available on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites trapped in a box bag, even though a couple of camps were empty.
The Jaakko Kaides, who was responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti Enterprises, was sorry for the damage to the East Sanoma.
The background is that three of the five sets were lost in the wrong place yesterday (the Seinjoki) and we were no longer going to do the partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we took only five stage today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanonom.
It was the first night of the evening.
Teija Halti didn’t chew from the sign because she found all her own loose cardboards.

At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then 10 pounds.
During the three-month gym, five pounds fell.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: The memories of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and adresses with a donation for police work.
The Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update that conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipo Zoo and also completed his training there.
The veterinary centre remembers the words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work unbelievably.
Good friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
Facebook updates include an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation funds go to the police officers as a whole, primarily for the purchase of security links.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old local woman was murdered in her own house in Loviisa Koskenky.
The woman’s neighbors have said that the victim of the evening magazine was very animal-rich.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder knew a woman and had nothing to do with each other.
Police dog Börje, who was in danger of life in the arrest situation, was involved in the tracking of the murderer.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal passed a judgment on the violation of the Law of Equality to Post
The post had no right to reserve the salary of the employee who refused to familiarize the tenant, the judge of Kanta-Hämeen was assessed in his judgment.
The right of emergency imposed on Posti to pay the worker most of the tax charged and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the Court, the Posti could only have arrested a part of the student’s salary, which was responsible for the whole day’s work.
According to the Court of Appeal, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his professional association.
The employee had complied with the resolution of the European Union for Postal and Logistics (PAU) on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During the last November post office, the PAU made a decision that Post employees would not familiarize with the infringing tenants.
People’s news first told me about it.
Turkey to return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights respecting development, writing Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his letter to Sipil and Soini, the Journalist Union asked for its concerns for Turkey's freedom of expression and press.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought the importance of freedom of press and expression to Turkey.
Putin resigned the chief of his administration - in replace with the Estonian Nato
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
The place will be the son-in-law of the Soviet-Viron Communist Director Karl Vaano Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as Vice President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It also becomes a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close inner circle, notes the Kremlin’s special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself asked for a transfer to another task and proposed that Vaino replace it, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during Soviet spying.
Many considered Ivanov possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU’s jackpot to the game ban - can’t see in the opening of the Valoliiga
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when England’s Valoliga kicks into the weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban was followed by English.
As a result of the ban on gambling, Manchester United’s jackpot against Bournemouth is on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to the Italian Society of Pogba.
However, the Finnish Football League FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was under a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season of the Italian Cup, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pogba’s next seam is on the second round of the league on August 19, when Manu meets Southampton.
Flow's Greatness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the role of Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event aimed at the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the main stage artists is the punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is set with artificial grass and art installation.
We've never had enough to be just a head and a cliff,\" says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahde Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to events of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: What kind of event do the authors themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in the production of events that we think so.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the Authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell to the end this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year with 5,000 people.
This year there are a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because there is a way to finance it.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is directed in the vast pathways.
That's what we don't want.
Over 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been embroidered in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in a partially artificial environment.
In addition to the main and smaller stage, this year, 15 000 tents of people operate.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more easily.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operation of the event was very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for around €20,000.
Last year, the net sales of the company running Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It enables you to create a “creator’s case,” such as the construction of that 73-metre wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the trendy young adult community.
However, the event has not been profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
We want to be separated primarily by content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit the world of Flow’s dignity: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment,” Kallio said.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a bunch of legends, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he doesn't have the most typical performer on Indian, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was dropped because it is probably the last time we see this in the gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's called on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's done a hell of a lot of good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in florists - tourists fled in their horrors
In Hua Hin, the local time exploded on Thursday night, two bombs exploded.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were hidden in the flower bag and exploded with the help of the phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative, Samomer Yoosumran CNN, said.
From 1989, the wild animal protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, made a much sound picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can look at it here.
At least 11 foreign tourists were injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on Phuket’s island by favor of Finns.
No one died knowingly.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bomb attacks that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the local authorities, the case may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken action by criminal organizations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new forces of readiness will begin the battle in the first time in the war.
In the acute military situation, the armed forces will only be ordered after several months of a military oath, says the Middle Finn.
According to Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the magazine, for example, for the 5,5 months of servicers in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the training manager, the service will first be provided by the reserve members belonging to the standby forces.
No backup or reserve owners are assigned a task that has not been assigned to the required training,\" Sonnninen said.
Previously, in the summer, the Defence Forces began to train backups to the units of immediate readiness next year.
Units may be used in military operations as soon as necessary during military training.
Pamela Tola got a jackpot from the home house
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-wife, Pauli Waroma, have won the fine dispute from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trading, however, there was a serious humidity problem in the house, which caused dangerous microbi growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case and demanded a discount from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the flyer and the hottie.
The court passed a judgment on the case Wednesday.
It was held in force by the District Court of Appeal which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 3444 for the costs of trial and investigation of the couple.
The right to a small reduction in the price, since some of the household repair needs had already been known to the purchasers when making a housing transaction.
According to the court law, the building errors were substantially more serious than the building errors that had been presented.
Tola is looking for a home of good fortune.
Tola said in the courtroom that the couple had been looking for a home of good fortunes because they did not want to take repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was repaired and in good condition, and there is no harm to the issues mentioned in the rehabilitation report.
The rehabilitation report referred to the risks and inaccuracies of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding and melting waters along the cliff.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that rainwaters from the cliff might have to be slightly controlled within a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the home’s moisture problems were much more serious.
In the 2012 and 2013 inspections, the building found microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses, was due to both a rock rainfall and a capillary rise in the land.
In the West, air contaminated by microbes could, according to the auditor’s assessment, be released through the receipt into the interior.
Health risk-optimizing, cross-border, or sand was found in wing displays in the housecare room, the basement staircase, the living room window broker, and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without a permit
The law also contested whether the apartment had been expanded against the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of Espoo to make a permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were central to justice.
According to court law, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a broader inspection.
Customers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the court ruling states in their judgment.
Karmiva archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also in the register of Finns
Christopher Andersson writes in his new article Dagens Nyheter, on how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have stored documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SSmen.
Most women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazimorsim.
Documents and registration cards come from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under the leadership of the SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he had studied the SS doctor.
The same was even more true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The breed agency examined women’s backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
It was meant to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency hand-written life stories and good recommendations from close relatives.
The breed agency wanted to make sure that women were \"children's loved ones\" and \"good national socialists\", who were well-known in German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride for SS men.
There is no record of the 14 Finns found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a government-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS person should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are told.
Instead, the population policy of the Nazis focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother's Honorary Cross was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between Arabs and non-Aryans were prohibited by law, according to the museum’s pages.
In the sixth place, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was the third sailboat of Finnjoll's day leaving Rio's Olympic Games, but remained the second flight of the day.
Nirkko rose to the eighth end after five departures, but the failure of the other leaves dropped him to the 14th place.
Tuuli Pejaja-Sire fought at RS:X-Class Day departures in 17 and three.
In total, Pejaja-Sire is sixth.
In the 470 class, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening of the day.
In total, Lindgrens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulin was recorded for a couple of hours at night: “I was so in the trunk.
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship bar to the Tangokuinka in 1995, Finland is best sold as soloartist, as well as the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää continues to drill and is currently in a rough lifting.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, published today on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells about her life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the bridgehead rose to a total rise in his defeat of the Tangokuin krona in the Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang Tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had prepared a tank piece, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanpää sang it on a tape in a terrible crash and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the trunk!
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
As a huge hit, the capture of a song would not immediately think it was sung in a rapper.
Although I was not physically the best, the trace was still good.
I learned that it is not always necessary to demand a perfect and top.
One of the most popular pieces of the man, which is mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from her bridge partner and eventually ended up in the texts of the gold piece, which was published in singles in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Rõmäs were not like Sillanpää would have wanted.
The head of the bridge had imagined that he was making a record that tells the story of his own life, but the words of the separation song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, Jar and the ex-serious difference was said to be the reason for Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but Jari said it was a full coup and did not keep it in place.
According to the book, Jari called the album angryly and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the voting week's polls predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the power flow of their profession.
The main mantra of Western politics, the theme of the US former president Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupids,\" flew to the collapse in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
the Financial Cheharan
The Centre for Macroeconomics explores the latest monthly professional responses to Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not heard because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the idea that the decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economistists, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists did not appear enough.
They were particularly discouraged by the balance of the BBC, which gave as much space to only a couple of economic scientists in favour of the European economition, as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU's anti-Semitic press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capacity combinations have on the consequences of the difference.
Those far-reaching letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were heard and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not have common interests.
The academics like the economists would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also the economy.
The Brexit vote's overwhelming victory argument was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will rub your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments were made.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every health centre waiting room you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British have medical days if they weren’t?
There are also immigrant children in every school.
How much easier would the right British children get school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in each municipality.
How much more space would they have if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did succeed, their response did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are the net contributors of the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund booked in Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, a plan to win a B, or a camp that supports the EU, was started to be more prepared for.
Investors began to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily notation about the real estate fund that the news concerned.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At that time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds of the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
The real estate funds were therefore reserved for Brexit in a very different strategic way.
The funds closed trade
When the camp in favour of the EU was won, Europe was confused.
However, few weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney's speech by the Executive Director of the Central Bank of England, where he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they robbed the situation and raised it to the main interests of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund closed its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the elderly, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down, and most of them withdrew the notice.
Since then, the market has been very stable, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks,\" Vanhanen says.
He notes that, for example, there has been no similar blows in the Manner-Europe funds in Aberdeen.
However, there was a lot of surveys.
Expensive attention to real estate funds
According to the elderly, the closures of the trading of real estate funds had a lot of attention.
Open funds that were covered by closures are managed by around four percent of British real estates.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds on the 2017 side.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have gone down, but the situation does not seem more direct to Aberdeen.
The major issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
The price and dollar rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The dealer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of good buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines on the London real estate market
Two nights ago, the situation didn't look very glamorous.
But from four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, in the UK, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's where the power came from.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
In the office, normally unvoiced TV boxes supported news, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was the morning that he never thought he was alive, old man says.
It is not because, in spite of mystery, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, finished the day after Brexit’s vote, or two real estate trades.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote began with a correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, Britain's leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate severe reductions in the UK’s real estate markets, especially London.
London’s office accounts predicted up to 20% of mines in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
The poison has now gone down, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not look like the last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on the old man’s face.
In his opinion, it is too early to say a lot about what Brexit follows.
There is so much still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already received first data.
The CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London’s real estate decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, minus 6,1 per cent, Vanhanen reads.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987, and only five months had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was relatively quickly compared to the global economic crisis that started in Lehman and the real estate market in the United States.
The old people don’t think the comparison is quite a hit, as it is now a British home-like crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales such as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
Financial guarantees are also found normally.
The repair movement could have been in front of you anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle of him – one could have been in front of Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of London’s and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
For two years, we have said that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall began to be very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the old list.
Britain’s economy has grown strongly, the population of London is also increasing.
The second major trend is that the properties are the last class of property that is globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have come to the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as a city with an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, for example, pension companies have been forced to look for returns on new destinations.
This loan has been easily available, although debt shortages have been used by the Vanhasen now clearly less than during the 2008 boom.
Spread, disperse
In London, the price rise fell last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn, and now it came.
What's going on here?
It depends on how Britain’s economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge the future, but he says that there is hardly any rise.
The feeling suggests that there is a falling or even way ahead.
Old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who believes that we're going to make it work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have scattered, the risks are also scattered, olden says.
The S Group begins to register the purchase information in more detail
The S Group knows what you’re eating, as today the trading group said they’re starting to collect more accurate information about their customers’ purchases.
As far as information has been collected from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to dream of the products purchased in early May.
The S Group is coming after Kesko, as the information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Customer Register of Kesko for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have denied the use of product information, Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S Group's registration.
According to food purchases alone, Kesko classifies its customers in ten groups.
The classification will be updated monthly.
Kanta customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they use.
The information is used for targeted marketing.
The product-specific purchase data is collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer program and does not have one of the plans.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer program, which can be associated with the selection houses, Siws and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product group data, we remain at the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchase was made, and on that day, and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says Anu Ora.
According to him, the client program is scheduled to be renewed in the future, but the Middle East trade will tell us later.
Ora does not, however, promise to register the product data.
Start with the experiment
SOK’s customer and customer register has so far been relatively large.
In addition to the personal and address information, the basic information includes the profession, education, the form of housing, the birth years of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded in the S-Ettucard purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been received from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had the hope that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Business.
The S group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash can't access the data, says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-pendu is Tullin's latest dog injury - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador's puppy snores heavily five boxes of the same country at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite game.
The box, which Heila sat next to, revealed a bit of shattering humidifiers to the square gas.
The flu is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila Dog.
Security situation and access to online trading
Heila is the first dog specialising in the search for arms and explosives and is placed at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Job tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing sites and ports as well.
However, the airport will be the main job of Heila because the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Tull and after attacks have been confirmed,” says Tull’s chief inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another access to training of weapons and explosives in Tulli’s tasks is mail transit through Helsinki-Vanta.
With an increased Internet trade, up to 40 million posts are sent annually through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
Over the last few years, the customs has made online shopping at Helsinki Airport, from passenger aircraft’s luggage and air cargo, about 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their source materials.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In the ports, it will benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and spot areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Tull will assess whether weapons and explosives will be further trained in the future.
Grönberg is looking forward to the idea.
School in the Church
Heila-pennus training is coordinated by Tull's dog school in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defense experts.
The police have a strong experience in training dogs and with the Defence Forces expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vanta are Tull’s six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dogs Mass.
Labrador's inventor Heila has been chosen from ten puppy puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog chosen for the airport include a raid and a hunting conversation, as well as a tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home at Suntion, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Fine orders go to Heila from one time to another.
The cameraman in the East Sanomas loses the camera's sword cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns a soft toy-looking shield immediately from the \"irti\" command.
Hard competition from the workshop
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the next in October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can see jobs on Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t be able to smooth the dog on the counter, like Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working parts last only ten minutes for hours.
The owner of the dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila was the owner of around 20-30 Tull employees.
Lucky hit the Suntion point, who has never had a job dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministry has its first Olympic medal - the people have a free day
The Olympic gold of less than a million residents in Fiji is valued in the country so high that the government has appointed 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, Fiji’s government confirmed that the championship was resolved.
The day of release is the next day of the team's return.
The hero team also has celebrations in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby Team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by a final in the capital town of Suvala, where the stadium had been erected.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in the Chinese restaurants, I heard them encouraging, said Maikele Seru Guardian, reporter of the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish player passed out after the execution of the hurricane
Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the punishments, he has fainted several times.
No one has been able to tell you why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of work in Rio and 145 pounds of temp.
His joint result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get a last of 175 pounds, as well as another.
In the third company, the weight rose as a result of a fierce scream.
The body was under pressure until the jury accepted the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finns is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires a viroist Prosan - Veikkausliga - Ilta-Sanomat
The male football player Rovaniemi Palloseura has concluded a long-lasting agreement with the Estonian rapist Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a team of top players with power and a threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With more than ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
The small village began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, the RoPS coach, Juha Malinen, said in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the winter Flora, where she made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinjo where the Rovaniers meet with the ruling Finnish Master SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker, when Alexander Kokko, the last-time secular king, moved to Australia.
The Victim Modern Family Star meets again: Teen Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as Alex Dunphyna, is remodeled by the modern Family comedy, again by showing his wonderful body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave a lot of imagination behind.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's feet, but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behavior much more courageous.
The star has put up a lot of tattoos in the pictures published in social media.
A young woman has also been shown to dress up in very scarce homes.
Winter at the threshold of adultity has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter had changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected Winter had a typical change in Hollywood.
He has been on television for almost the entire life of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he reveals the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News, and more that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has become nervous about some of his long-term fans with an image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some women’s fans, however, defend an actor and urge them not to care for criticism.
You look great!
Just as the others say.
You're an inspiration for many women, you're an inspiration for a young woman.
The Japanese prefer Nordics to Finland - tourists are attracted to the revolving fire: Autumn is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the rerun tours from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese revolving tourism.
Revon lights are the cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter excursions have great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the renovation season begins from the early autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the revulsant lights, making the vision of two layers of random, according to Visit Finland v. Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the visit to Finland’s renovative campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese, however, would like to have clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lindin, this revonuli has enormous potential.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice a year in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to be satisfied with the silver rugby-7 race when the FIdz champion team won gold.
The impressive success of the UK in seven players in the Rugby race was crushed by the fact that Fidzi won it on Thursday in the final at the Rion Deodoro Stadium in the numbers 43-17.
Fidzi gave the Masters’ teaching in ball handling, transmissions, side drills, support game, running lines and raa, and thus won gold – if there was the first Olympic medal in its history.
Tappio meant silver, which was a little thinr for Britain, because it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the Rugby-7 tournament for the first time, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the 7-5 semifinals before the same day the team could have a negative impact on the finals.
Nevertheless, the FIdz team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-year-old team had been in full power.
For the UK, at least one British has a gold medal tomorrow: Fidz’s chief coach Ben Ryan, a former English Rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite large for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's coaching at Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The fight is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi began well and presented his tacquer skills to the UK as a result of interest.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had crashed into a group of buses, and the world champions rose to 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau made the corner.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai made the other goal in the right place from the goal kick.
The situation was 12-0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s stunning tactic prevented the shocking Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn’t slow down Fidz’s journey for long.
After the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal in the right corner, after which the UK was at a loss of 17-0.
Nakarawa made the second goal of the continuation, when the first half of the game time was still left for more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravovovou fell into the UK team through the more powerful fights and fell across the target line.
After the landing, the opening period ended in the situation from 29 to 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the seven players Rugby, while the British are still in the role of the learner.
Which is very true.
The United Kingdom made large-scale changes in half-time and managed to arrest the Fidzilans for four minutes, which compared to the first half of the period was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team role of the Fidzilainens.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36-7 by making Britain the left corner of the goal, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang in the audience, waved the flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fidz’s pure joy.
Mata Vilame made a final stop for the Fidzilainen cake by making the goal in the last few moments.
Pill went, the Fijians spit on each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semifinals from 20 to 5 and the UK had drawn the South Africa to a strict semifinal, where the balance was solved by the British goal.
Kyle Brown took the South African boxes to the head in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the line with his dazzling footjob and hit under the paint towels in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, who is a Rugby team of 15 players in England, seals the victory and eventually the shopping hall.
The coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to fight gold.
The more emotional the gold could not be in these races.
From the first bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning spent 220 winning bets in history and found an additional piece of work for the golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although in the air they were two, in the boat the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to the second consecutive Olympics in the women's twins. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports, which will bring them to a similar achievement.
Their supremacy was undisputed, their victory was already 39 consecutive and once more record.
What we see, two great athletes attaching to the surface of water like springs, does not entirely correspond to the nature of success.
There is a large number of helping hands behind each row, each of which has taken a twin towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed the cancer 30 months ago, and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
“I had a bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonal season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if, in such circumstances, it could even be said.
“I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It worked as a incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department at 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning, who had a tour of Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been ruined this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much.
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t hope for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm for which their competitors have not managed to draw blood.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very close in a moment.
Helen Hoki-Pysy with you, stay with me.
It's very important that you don't get out of the way.
“We were happy to go well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We did not aim for heaven today, we just wanted to make a good war and win the race we did.
The two will think about a year before deciding on their future.
Glover celebrates next month’s TV nature programs with familiar Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure.
“After London, it lasted about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
It took about four minutes to realize this time.
This feels so much better, he says.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland organises early parliamentary elections in October, which are already required by the protestors who have been raped by Panama’s information leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed taxes on several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last rage of the people affects the election result of the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, the criticism of the rulings clearly appeared, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and democratic candidate of the terrorist organization Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry with the speech and asked for an apology from Trump.
The commander of the army should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton's quote.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini swimsuit that is popular for Muslims on swimming beaches, including the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beach and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a swimming suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming homes, which express a high level of religious links, can increase the risk of order disruptions in France, which has been targeted by terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, the two extremists, connected to Isis, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the swimming water in the Oulu area passed through the seula - Lake Pykösjärvi blue-colding samurai
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only a blue sea has been detected on the Pykösjärvi beach.
The environmental action of the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public swimming beaches in the Oulu region during Tuesday and mid-week.
With the exception of the seaniemi coast, the concentrations of all enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters of the bathing areas of the bathing areas of the bathing areas of the bathing areas under the limits set by the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of the coastal water of Merinieme were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the limits of action.
The bluefinery observed on the shore of the lake of the lake of the pyyskörvi does not yet make the water unsaturated, but in favorable conditions, the situation may change rapidly as blue-skinned ham, when the surface of the water is formed with a blue-green rest.
Environmental measures will follow the case through enhanced inspections.
If the bluefin tuna is transformed into a blue whirlpool, it will also be reported separately on the pool reporting table.

M.K.'s Jäärainen for the reduction of forest gifts: more than 80% of forest owners outside
Metsä gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives: promoting the generation of forest farms, youthing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forest farms and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurship.
The forest owner would reduce the clean income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commented Juha Päärainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds a critical tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts is a task for the clean capital income of the forestowner.
It is a capital income that has been reduced to all other losses.
The effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The proposal for a VM leaves the source of a reduction in the clean income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of the share income of the forestry sector from being reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if it was not sold.
The calculation model is completely complex.
The average forest owner is unable to imagine it,” says Tuurainen.
The model also applies to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit attached to the forest’s yield value is EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn to a little bit too high.
As such, he said 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest stock distribution, he said.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing space.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been carried out by Päärainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MKK, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful raemuraro surprised the drivers with Himanga - two cars were stuck in the stream and bumped into each other.
In the Kalajoki Himanga, there was a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two cars were in a row, and after which they ran after him.
According to Harri Püühti, a friend-in-law's firefighter, the wind-up is suspected of being driven by a powerful shattering.
In the back of time there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver was not injured.

Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
New research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of cancer cancer increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such a environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells, in addition to the cells and the surrounding tissue.
Research results have been published in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology on 4 August.
Muhko's family home injury continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another person.
In the case of both sentenced persons, the fall of the Muhok family home is continued.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for a family home in Muho.
The second one received 8 months of killing as a young person and a serious robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment as a young person for murder and gross robbery.
The sentenced person was also convicted of a serious threat to road safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle as a young person.
The judge, prosecutors and a man convicted of a more severe sentence, complained of the judgment of the judge.
The prosecutor demands a lesser sentence for murder committed as a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to a court law, 17-year-old youngsters killed a school house as a child protection director in the last July of the year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder, according to the grounds of the judgment, attacked the director who was sitting on the couch in the living room.
The director had been able to get rid of the sample and to withstand the young person in his room, when another young man hit him on a hole in the hole.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind study, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world’s longest-aged spine, growing only at 156 years of age
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by ice-cream, according to a study published in the Science magazine.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark around Greenland, the Holocaust can live up to 400 years old.
The female will only grow at 156 years of age.
I'd rather live more than a centimeter per year.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to last longer.
The researchers found out the age of the radio-carbon race.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, though the throw in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state’s tax revenue would not be received if the change in Donald Trump’s corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the most expensive tax relief.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax fell from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting, it would be a huge amount of $1,000 a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be fully surrendered.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation in the business sector and of running small businesses into bankruptcy.
The final environmental standards for emergency systems must be renewed and the energy regulation must be dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health reform needs to be discussed again.
The Board shall appoint experts instead of bureaucrats.
According to Trump, trade policy is the main cause of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be released.
For imports, 45% of China and 35% of Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new cloud builders all over the country.
By the way, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though the well-organized protests cut it off 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump’s program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced his program on Friday.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is in a fatal way, but the actual attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street - accounting with the past can begin.
It contains the heart of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work for Travelers (2013) was a little fun and a roskin's satiric comedy, before it was the one in which I live (2011) Spanish tourist career peaks.
Juliet (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a harmonious, sedentary love, relationship and family drama, with a mother-and-girl relationship at the center.
The story is a chimp, and we see a lot of it in a long way.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandetti) must be amazed at the end of the film.
In the form of a recovery and a long letter, Julieta once had the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who is a young teacher of Julieta, will rise from the TV-based series between Ommelten (2013-2014).
Julieta’s ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cage, but I would say that time is odd and verbally simple.
Almodóvar films often have a fair distance in Julieta to such a characteristic silicone.
It is a flat-screened, slowed, placed in good music and rather sad-like film, with ingredients such as ego.
Instead, the typical visual color is stored for the Spanish director, and so that it begins to inject a little bit more slowly into the eye as a pure piece of shape than as a functional dramatical power.
Diseases, deaths, or only sudden loss of the film, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for clothing: in the case of a no-person, the inhabitants will change from one scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, or the sentences of each scene, is not particularly appropriate.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is externally and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, Nobel 2013 award.
The Novellit was published in the work of Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, as a result of a somewhat consistent written literature filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally disproportionate to even more dramatic drama, as much as the big things - especially the pale guilt - are dealt with by the nature of the film.
Instruction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandintetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to make elections - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers will be able to ensure that the basic Finns do not collapse to the fullest extent.
However, the cut-offs decided in the spring are made by a rap shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (kok).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefits, pension, basic unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment insurance for an associative person is reduced to 400 from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Cultivated by Kuntavas
Why do ministers stress that there is no new surgery on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and will be the most important heat meter during the election period, not the gallupes.
It has been seen before that the monthly outcome of the government parties in different directions ruins the government’s atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallupit says that the government party of the Finnish people is waiting for a roasting drop, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
The Finns received 752 new mandates four years ago, most of which will be realized next spring the price of influence in the judiciary.
The lifeline of the three political parties is about the same as that of the Finnish people.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s visit to the parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
In the first place, new cuts will not be obscured by the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, try to soften the expectations of the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Sipilka government is still standing.
The government has set a target for the recovery of debt during this election period, but the Petter Orpo draft budget will be committed to EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the locals, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and admit that the government is not able to comply with its own programme: debt is not skilled and not even slow.
The other one is holding on to the program.
This means new cuts to formers in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring it will be taken against the parliamentary elections.
Debt does not benefit from these activities.
It is absolutely clear that the debt of current activities is not skilled, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to relieve a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the meeting of the budget will prove unacceptable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt premium submitted by the left-wing Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The next year, unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a whole new debt.
This is the understanding of the centre, collection and basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of tasks to the King
Three out of four believe that the organization of children’s day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to the study of the KAKS - Regional Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic education, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
In turn, the county’s responsibility for the region is more clearly sought by county planning, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
There is no need to transfer the tasks of municipalities to the State.
A low-age racer ran behind the road after the police ran away
The 16-year-old motorcyclist was driving the police patrol out in Joensu on Friday night at midnight.
The police team tried to stop without lights on the motorcycle, but the young man left to drive the police out of the loop for a bit of speed.
The backway continued to the Sonkajarantatie, from which to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle was driven out of the way.
Even after that, a young man went running away, but a faster police officer ran into a fugitive.
A blow test for the driver showed 0.75 as a prom.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the rock fell into its stream.
The truck in the Stonelands fell on the lake of Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in the curved mud out of the road and fell on its side.
The rescue facility raised the injured driver from the fallen truck through the door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first pilots.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
The damaged truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was absorbed by the rescue plant into peat.
Police are investigating the cause of an accident.
The old woman disappeared in the afternoon
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon at the Lahtikyla in South Ostrobothnia.

The findings and clues of lost movements are requested to be played by the North-Western State Center’s hintering number.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the image gallery of the destruction of Parafest
Parafest-festival tents poured a shock flow caused massive damage.
The President of the Finnish Parafesst Association of Joensuu, Arto Pippori, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its economic feet, and the event will also be held next year.
The last performer in Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on Friday night at the end of the story.
On Saturday, the program will continue with the presentations held at the city theater’s premises from 13 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program will be organized as planned.
The shock flow is generated in the lightning cloud when the rainwater and its weight triggers the falling air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the ukcos cloud bind to heat, and therefore the falling air in the air cools and its speeds towards the ground.
It is reported from the Finnish Institute of Aviation that there are shock flows in Finland during several summer periods.
It's hard to predict the route of cancer flows.
The cancer flow hit the back yard of the Joensu Art Museum at Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were destroyed, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the river who was transported to a mildly injured after treatment.
Air pollution is ageing in London.
According to the study, the skin of London is ageing faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study tells the Event Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than the age partner living in rural areas.
The small particles that age the skin are a very good dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, kill almost 9,500 Londons every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk their business in the vicinity of dirty streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.
Tractor's brakes betrayed a man standing in front of him.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor, and went to the front of it, the brakes of the tractor betrayed and the tractor poured on the man.

Anne J Partnernen has been playing in almost all Salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now in Tampere, there are already six races going, only 2013 left behind in North American Carnations since Canada.
I was working in Turku and playing with the naked women when I noticed the announcement.

I was interested and here we are now, J Partner, 48, says.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jpülnen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that wasn’t played at the SM level yet.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj ice hockey in the SM series, J Partnernen remembers.
The partner played the Salibandy SM series with the University during the 1991-92 period, the following three were spent in Josba.

Beach volley Taituri Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending a beach volley player at least after a temporary period.
The Grand Beach championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In collaboration with Kouvola Airport Ballooners and the Finnish Aviation Union, the SM-final tournament is awarded six best pairs in each series.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, which has been part of Finland’s beach volley tickets for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope that as many people as possible can get to the audience on the weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven’t played very often in adult series in Kouvola, so it’s great to play at the finals at home, Hasu’s atmosphere.
The Kouvola area was lit into the sport of Hasu's rock and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started the flight at the age of nine in the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
On top of it is too big toy, the knee protections in the ankles, as well as the gorgeous azlouds and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
At a small location, the sports club was a busy community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle’s beach volley was a natural selection of species during the junior era to counter-balance the indoor balloon.
The swimming pool has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
It has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour, thinking that some day I would be playing there.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with the Piksämäkis Annina Parkkinen in the SM finals.
The aim of the second-red twin in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti.
To be realistic, we have a medal.
SM Gold is still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws in a valuable way.
A weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of Hasu’s familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, towels are temporarily placed on the nail, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli went bravely to be a farmer
As an entrepreneurship, agriculture means risk-taking, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working with her little brother Valtter Koli about two years ago as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advise brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing the order so that bread could come from agriculture.
It's been my case since I was a little boy.
I’ve always been very happy at the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and well.
In 2013, we started to build a little bit, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells me and adds that he would not have done it if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli is to invest even bigger.
The work has yielded results, for Solomon's Koli has been selected to the top 10 best groups in the competition of the young cooking producer of the Earth's Future magazine.
At best, he competes for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until 21.8.

Snapchat’s anime effect is criticized as an asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was an anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, a dog or a character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are unprepared, features of distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie daily.
All delusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received a review where it has been accused of promoting blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty extract.
So when it offered some of its users this week, a filter that turned their eyes into pins, fake teeth and made the cheeks of the bulls, some critics called it racist caricature from Asian people-yellowface.
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts were referring to a bigger problem that the company had with differences.
The news and rage spread on a large Wednesday, and it was written by The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat said he removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was intended for an anime character, not as a cartoon for Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them said they were an anime version.
The Korean American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet images were widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was “at least offensive and awkward.”
He adds: “It’s hard to deny the very tasteless Asian cartoon to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter isn’t just “yellowface” but was taken to a degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it is known that there is endless struggle between diversity and social inclusion, always from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s great audience consists of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their parents’ counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect subtleity even more.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates a picture that violates the user, things like this will no longer be very easy to notice, as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu interview on Thursday.
As a product manager and designer, Zhu, who works in the Medium publishing platform, decided to remove its Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and phone interview at the media, he said he believed that the ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the company’s main part of the white and only men’s leadership and decided on the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It is either that there are no colourful people in their unilateral staff, when they can make such decisions, or then they also have colorful workers, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinion directly and easily,” says Zhu, Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely refused to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, appealing to its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to his informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented groups and the promotion of involvement within the company.
Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and more: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.
According to the Congress expert group, military officials have violated the information about Isisi.
On Thursday, the Congress expert group published a report that officials of the U.S. Armed Forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isles in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the field caused to understand.
The Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives (House Armed Services Committee) called on the Republican Presidents to set up a working group to report on the general dissatisfaction of armed intelligence analysts, according to analysts, the Supreme Military Authorities to be decorated with American action against the Isles.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The polls approved by the senior executives of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of anti-terrorism activities in the United States than the facts showed on the field, and were, without exception, more positive than the analyses of other services in the intelligence community,” says the press release on the report.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level policy makers,” says Ken Calvert, California’s Republican Representative.
The errors of Centcom’s leadership port extend to the top level of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American activities in order to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports ordered by Obama’s administrative authorities would have been counterfeited, it gives an analytical picture of the perception that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
“In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command’s press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were,” says the report.
“For example, Centcom’s official publicly issued an opinion stating that a large military attack on the return of Mosul could take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
“After six months of research, this is very clear,” says Mike Pompeo, the Republican Representative of Kansas.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Armed Forces’ Supreme Intelligence Officers manipulated the intelligence received in order to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after obtaining knowledge of the suspicions expressed by analysts that the information on the person would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more accurate results, as studies continue.
In addition, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence data.
On Thursday, the members of the committee responsible for the inquiry of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a too limited process by which intelligence data on the security forces in Iceland and Iraq was assessed,” said Adam B. Schiff, a prominent democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process delayed the release of intelligence results, \"the morality of analysts, and \"notably ignores the differing views\".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to a predetermined or political official line.
On Tuesday, Daily Beat announced the preliminary results of the study carried out by Congress.
In August last year, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon chief investigator, which began as a result of claims made by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Patrick Evans, says in his statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation of the inspector is underway.
However, he says: “The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.
The investigation also has other consequences, in addition to trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by one of several defence authorities).
However, the claims made last year could question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command and that it would give an honest assessment of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism on personal intelligence is in line with the differences that occurred more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that says the government of President George W. Bush, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent only a little time reflecting on what would be followed by the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a central role in the rebellion on personal intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, Hoker’s working group concluded that, despite the contrary public statements, the air strikes on the processing facilities controlled by Isis had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy because it had built temporary processing plants and thus managed to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, had been criticized last year after many legislators had assessed the statements given to the Senate that were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and in his place General Joseph L. Votel rose to the Central Command Commander.
The United States will win the fourth double match in women's landshockey and establish its position in mid-term review with Britain
After making three goals in the win-win, the lay-off game against Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American women's country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
“I’m not part of people who keep a record of what they’re doing.
However, he knows: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games, and in their group they share the first place with Britain, which continued to win their winning pipe on Thursdays to the Japanese chapters 2 to 0.
The United Kingdom and the United States are playing in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be placed as the first and second of the six teams to form the first and second.
The first to avoid a longer encounter with a hard-on Dutch team that won the second one.
Despite how it goes on Saturday's game, Americans have already raised their surprise success in these races, four years after it last left 12 teams in London's Olympics.
Bam was also in the team in London.
He grew up in the state of Blue Bell in Pennsylvania and took his country-hockeyland for the first time only when he was 3 years old (his parents played a double sister in Drexel).
The 2008 Olympics missed him when he did not survive the final player list.
After that, the 2012 competitions came, where he and his team were not seen to be successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed as an English coach, after which things began to change.
“The Muutos was cultural, mental and physical,” Bam says.
“We worked in London was not what it is now.
We have made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the painting account in the first half of the first half by hitting the ball near the rystylyön.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly hard opponent and maintained a 1 to 0 situation until the third stage, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball a long time along the left side of the field, climbed to the center, hit the goal of the ball, and led the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament in which American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had drowned one hit.
Briggs now lives in his success,
Same as Bam.
“Our attitude is good now,” Parnham says, but how good it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the middle of Olympiahulina, trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics will inevitably crash.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next exciting message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympics themselves were a flame-reflecting message capsule, moving from a bow to a swimmer, a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the café queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics’ first-time Dooley smiled and could well be the name of all the lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be the sponsors’ favorite and would appear in good mind TV ads if he was just a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordmaker.
But the Dooley from California Lake Forest, 28, competes from the Olympic Gold with trampoliin.
Olympic fire does not equally illuminate all competitions.
The distance from the center, in part in the shade, are less known sports, such as air pistolammoon, springmoon, ball ball and taekwondo.
We will always have breast-feeding, and keep the championship for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the dazzling charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since the competitions in Sydney in 2000, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic species.
Ignorance can be regional.
The U.S. has participated in the Olympics, but the country has never reached medals and has not moved to finals before 2012.
In men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russian, and on women's side the medals are two Canadians.
China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLenna are defending gold medals this year that they won in London.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underprivilegant, partly because in an uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this connection that I am not an expert, only a normal fan.)
The species have a collection of their potential, which has been used in the cartoons in the endless bombing scenes of the characters. But it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming baths, i.e. in species that are essentially connected to trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means “the pampering board”
Honorary masters jump with a huge trample that snores them to a height of almost 10 metres. Before landing, the jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes from the trampoline race are competing for the championship, coming from 17 different countries. Of them, there are 16 men and women 16.
The most common Olympic species are straight ahead.
The medals have to go further, faster, up and above, sometimes above the finish line, sometimes at the back of the field.
In addition to the painting line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to which they are seeking a world or Olympic exhibition in television stations.
This determined pursuit is luxurious, admirable, even fanatical – and is enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find it a little exhausted in watching the races.
This trampoline offers a breathtaking state.
Trampoliin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The power-lifter will climb up like an astronaut, fall down, and snore back up.
Of course, the species also include a competition aspect, and it is not easy, but it is not associated with an intense rush to the goal and not to jump far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as the Olympics can only be won.
Women's basketball matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 p.m. at local time and the men's respective races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends finals as part of the afternoon broadcast, which starts at 14:00 local time on the Kumpakaki day.
In the midst of Olympiamania, they will bring a quiet and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general hula, might remain unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and performing them – as the U.S. male champions Wall Street Journal said recently suggested – in that case Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fan group to be taken care of.
The whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violence protests in Ethiopia
The government's forces have scattered the protests that require political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in contact with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable Western ally, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In the past few months, however, the country has undergone anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people were rushing to the streets, requiring a profound political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's reaction was unmistakable.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several unarmed protestors.
In the last year or in the videos described at the beginning of this year, the security forces will see how the young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, which has been promoted by the West for stability.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are strongly supported by the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, receive so much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new farm.
The streets of the cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have consistently reported the government's oppression policy, the opposition country is very limited and dissident quickly.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
“If the people are suppressed, and it has no choice but to show its mind, it will break out,” says Seyom Teshome, who works as a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
“Today, young people show their minds.
The whole generation protests
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, always from land use to the curvature of the government coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last place in the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the whole parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at Eritrea’s border, where the depressed situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less flourished separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Opaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm.
For the reason why a bitter mood over the years breaks down right now, there are many reasons.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
For the last couple of years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when more affordable smartphones became common and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people get to the Internet through streaming servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopians told me that this is how they called people protests.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amhars.
Oromot and amphas are not natural allies.
Most of Ethiopia’s high-Christian amphariats have long ruled the country’s politics and business, and shattered the Oromas, most of which are Muslims and live in the suburbs.
But this is also changing.
“The joint work is getting deeper and we’re getting under the same umbrella,” says Mulatu Gemechu, director of Oromo.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos experience that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by the Tibetan tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and manages the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the rest is the death of Meles Zenawin.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a disease that was not mentioned in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, able to see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of dissatisfaction and to use ambassadors who agreed to the opposites.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says Abdi, a conflict researcher.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailamam Desalegn, entered Meles' boots from almost unknownity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the region of Tigren, North Ethiopia, Hailamam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces he manages.
Many people are afraid of this to mean more bloodshed.
For the last time, similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against the elections that the government first looted and then stolen according to analysts.
Many protesters were killed after the election, though, less dead than in the previous months, and the rest ceased relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for far-reaching infrastructure planning, such as the new spectrum of land, and the significant progress in combating poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented the inner regret of the government of Ethiopia.
And the apple is taking a dangerous form of ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amphara, attacked businesses owned by tigers, and the hate speech against tigers is becoming widespread in social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a harsh situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighboring Somalia for specific aircraft, but according to the United States, the base is recently closed.
At the same time, when the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want to collapse its allies in an already unstable region.
“This requires strict balance,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in the last dispute on his campaign, stating that he was not seriously arguing several times this week as the founders of President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
He also has to defend his candidates in these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump made a statement at the election meeting on Wednesday and repeated several interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President and Hillary Clinton had created the Isis.
In the early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said he was a sarcasm.
Trump completely passed out on the tweet from the last day when he said that he had been accused of several interviews.
When the radio driver and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The last critical storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when the suffering numbers fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would increase taxes and that Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump's been defended in the corner before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, “I was sarcastic.
This way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls its words back if necessary.
“I believe it’s his way of testing certain messages that raise a response to his supporters. He considers how the supporters react to messages, and “to clarify, then, in one way or another, depending on the reactions,” says Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass the different spins.
Instead of softening Trump’s statements to the electoral audience, he has made his style even more attractive in the last few days, when his suffering numbers have continued to decline.
A new opinion study by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist announced that Trump’s support is significantly lower in Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for excuses for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more precise in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his faithful supporters in a awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments, whether they are provocative.
One of Trump's greatest supporters, former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think that his words were justified, politically speaking,” Giuliani said when he was asked if Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton were based on the Isis.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called the “lower series team” and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to argue that the Obama regime, in which Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isis to continue its efforts when it did not deal with the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he accused them of suffocating and discriminatory attitude toward him.
He mocked the “unsatisfied and pathetic” television comedians trying to find out about him, but he can’t do it with him.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation, and they just said it would show more clearly that he was not fit for president.
Due to the excessive rent increase, the café stops opening in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a dirty coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was made for the payment instrument and there was no Wi-Fi, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside at Bedford Avenue, when renting was unfair.
Verb Cafen replaced Soap Cherie in the summer of 2014 to sell cup-shaped soaps.
The locals consider this to be an obstacle to the loss of the café under middle-classization.
“New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that there is no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop,” he said.
But even if New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café at Greenpoint, just a fair mile north of its original place.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unprepared.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, retained many things.
Verb order the bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressone model.
In addition, it again introduced even the old Verbin lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-canna cheese cheese-sandwiches available to fill capers and rubbed onions rings.
The list also has dark people.
Coffee is no longer beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After having held the café for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that the old standard customers began to visit Verbis as a constant flow.
“After many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg,” he said.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently went to the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he took a walk to the Verbin, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I felt like I liked Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took the usual ice coffee instead of his chai tea, which is also a list release.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithful in Verb since 2003.
He always went to the café before work and ordered the same without exception.
“I went to the café every day for more than seven than a machine, and there they were already making my sandwich with all the fillings,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal continues to order its standard product, but sometimes he varies from the bacon, egg and cheese fillings of his bagels.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a pity that the soap shop took the old place.
Soap Cherien’s owners even offered to make a special soap, which is used for the manufacture of Verb’s own cold-roasted coffee.
“We can still catch up with the offer,” Rodriguez says.
The Polish people who lived in Greenpoint have also accepted the coffee shop with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the food list to Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold coffee in the café.
Coffee may also expand into a adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough that they get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the café was closed.
When the new place was opened, and I ordered a coffee there, I felt like I had arrived home,\" Whitt said.
The smell of the cafe...
The Great Linguistic Food in New Works: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his arrival as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Kulinarist, had liked the luxurious foods of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the Hanhemaapisteja and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his food list was less modest: the devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, potatoes, and dessert from the broom.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.
The couple in Brooklyn Heights works as both food historians.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, says the story of the layered story in Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work is the A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food in the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreed to meet with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron Cloud Designer, and was opened in the same year as the big stock market crash took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive filling sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meat murky, the couple said it was suitable for a very large eating debate.
“The movements were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate peanut murky, liver murky and bean murky.
They were made of substances that were cheap and controversial.
Imagine your cancers so much peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal.
Andrew Coe.
“It must have been pressed in the stomach like lead,” he said.
Before the major flat years, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle, eating as much as you want.
Women made food for agricultural workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner served counter-free pies.
The Americans had just sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War. A Square Meal is a chronic ways in which the people survived when suddenly the supremacy had to be abandoned.
“This was a time when food became a central and harassing topic of the Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Ziegelman said that it was a new cheap diet: the prestigious foods such as concerns and pasta foods became the main food, and the pasta food was said to be a powerful way to make use of the food stars, because the cooks could not cover so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The flesh, which had been the main part of the American meal for many years, came with a sustainable use of luxury.
There were strange mixes where the most important thing was to fill the calorie and nutritional values, and not to taste or even a healthy kitchen lake.
When making a study for a book that includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman made the oven beans filled with peanuts used as a food type of pula-time.
“It couldn’t be popular at the dinner table,” Coe says.
Ziegelman added: “It was unreal.
Groundnuts and oven onions don't fit together at all.
This was characterized by many household prescriptions.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique manner.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be precise budgetmakers and to respond to the challenge of making delicious foods like carrot-kermaspaget.
The Square Meal book is a celebration of historical taste pots.
Particularly tasty are reports of government-led reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, who gives me the chance to eat cake.
While he publicly praised his childhood simple food on an iowan farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had come to him.
“He liked the continental kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
“He almost ate in a gold-coated dining room with a smooth on his head.
He was completely alienated by reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to show his stomach an example.
As stated in the book, when Mrs Roosevelt hired an economic nurse who was not interested in the taste, the foods offered in the White House were not only the most boring, but also the worst-made ones in Washington.
Many of the sheep-time foods were abandoned as soon as the country returned to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple tells us that when they wrote the book, they started to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why he couldn’t throw away food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” Coe said.
“People even started to get sick of his food,” said Ziegelman.
\"For the first time, the windmills...
After the main dishes were cleared in Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took up the bone food they produced at home, the same thing President Roosevelt at lunch.
“It’s called a nightmare,” says Ziegelman, and more that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only bones, little flour, sugar, water and canoe.
We just threw our spoon into a thick brown cottage.
Suddenly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe sneezed the second time and third.
\"German nuts would do better than this,\" Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead’s full compensation for legal fees for C-hepatite patent resistance with Merck
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the fees incurred by the legal dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc on the patent of hepatitis C.
Gilead was released in June for $200 million of damages that were imposed on him for violating two patents owned by Merck in the name of Gilead for Sovaldi and Harton for success medications. The American judge noted that Merck committed crimes, which included misdemeanours and other unethic practices.
In a complaint filed on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court said that Gilead was entitled to the exemption from the fees incurred by him in defending the case.
Merck is trying to achieve Gilead, which controls the market with the new generation of C-hepatite medications that can be treated with a high rate of 90% of hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other's justice and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S. support forces have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis
U.S. support forces have been taken over in Northern Syria near the city of Manjib, Turkey, when the last extremists left the city, the forces informant said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now split the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages were kidnapped by the Isis fighters.
“The cabin is now fully in our possession, but we still carry out search operations,” Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate of the Democrats, announced on Friday the 2015 tax declaration showing that the income of him and his husband was $10,75 million and the actual federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, most of which to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, a foreign minister, announced that he earned $3 million in his library at Simon & Schuster's office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax declaration.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain still look like a model for economic transparency,” says Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in the press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, hiding behind excuses and canceling his promises to publish his tax information.
According to the practice, US presidential candidates have always published their tax information, even if the law does not require it.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers, have appealed to the tax administration's review and said it's the reason Trump hasn't published his income data.
\"Sirto is yours – tweeted by Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the tax information of the Democratic Candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members of 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose information to raise questions about Trump’s own capital, his grants to charity, business relationships and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this question and published a video online on Friday, where he brings out prominent Republicans who are fleeing Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
\"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not public tax returns,\" Clinton said.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or pay just two in the 1990s, and New York Times business columnist sited a number of tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could continue to be similar.
The federal tax rates have become a key issue for the presidential elections.
According to Warren Buffett, Clinton has been supporting a billionaire investor from a designated rule that would ensure that more than $1 million per year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at Clinton’s election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway’s monaala company, challenged Trump’s meeting, where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons currently residing in the City of Chappaqua in New York City paid an average of 32% of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate paid by them was about 40.5%.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax declaration, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was the MIF, and Clinton announced a dividend and interest income of $100,000.

Chili powder filler condoms for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlement – elephants are ashamed to throw out condoms filled with chill powder for them.
Keino has proven to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeguide Foundation has launched a campaign with the American Nature Conservancy Organization, which aims to teach the volunteers of the villages in North Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultivated elephants without harming them.
Some time ago, nostrils were used for alarming elephants.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“We’ve been working on a method that has changed attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, intrusive elephants are embroidered by showing with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this doesn't work, the so-called chilipil will be thrown.
Multi mixed chill powder is placed in a condom together with a towel, and then the head of the condom is rounded up so that only the burning wire is left outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes and spreads into the air a fine chill powder cloud.
Usually, one taste cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is the thrower that shoots the light of a fire known as a Roman candle and produces a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticises Berlin’s hotel for removing Israel’s reference number from the Arabs – – RT News
The French, native Jewish film director gave birth to the media line, revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel’s reference number in its land number list. The hotel staff appealed to the Arabic customers when they asked for a call to the “hots” of Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on Holocaust, was frustrated with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
With his recent visit to Lanzmann, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel's location number list in Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
“How it is possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist.
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked an explanation about the hotel’s reception.
Lanzmann writes that the response of the reception officer shocked him.
The reception officer said that the removal of Israel from the list was “the decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hostels.”
The reason behind the procedure was even more shocked by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “The vast majority of our visitors are Arabs, and they demanded the removal of the Israeli reference number.
Suddeutsche Zeitung, German ambassador to Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the case “to be a great shame.”
“The return will stifle us and upset us all.
It's a shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is exactly the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” says the ambassador.
The incident caused a fairly counter-reaction online, where it was called scandal.
Some accused the Kampinski Hotel of simply giving rise to the claims of the alleged Arabic customers.
“Studently,” was said in a publication showing the location of the hotel near the Synagoga Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel's controversial accusations quickly, called a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
“The order to leave Israel was never given,” wrote the representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the direction number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber in the demonstration of Brazilian students
Students were brought together with the police on Thursday, when they gathered together to show their view of the reform of the government’s public education system.
The police used the protesters against tear gas and rubber.
The riot began when the law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student group, resulting in the police using rubber and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their perseverance to government plans were involved in the demonstration.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Gerdodo Alckmin, has made a proposal for a savings measure with nearly 100 public schools closed and 30,000 students invested in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls that temporarily opposed Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with separate presidents supported by Dilma Roussef when voting for the state Senate on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
After the exit of the packages, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
“Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The growth of trade remains, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries,” Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
“Russia’s exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects the record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“In the last year, the Russian foreign delegation in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was the first tourist destination among the first 20 countries to travel in Russia.
It is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran in turn is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved the ancient Persian civilization monuments in good condition,” he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner says he's got the goal when the British win the gold of cycling.
In Scotland, Callum Skinner denied the reputation of the men's team prince Rio's debts last night, when the British triad defended the championship that was earned in London in 2012.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner was in charge of the anchor’s role, which he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy from Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to thank the goal and grab the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of six Olympics.
And they repeated the pace after they had settled in the World Cup in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had left his career in competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
The price came out at the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race also left the hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man to whom Britain’s instructors believed and where they saw the potential he now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy with the championship four years ago won by Kenny and Skinner made the Olympics an exhibition at the time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was completely behind his tour, but Kenny made a effort to lead the team, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that the Hindus drove the pace to slow down at a higher rate, making it possible for Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached the Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ view of them when they entered the prize school.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner says: “I’m flattered by breast-feeding.
I was just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After winning in London 2012, Hindes admitted, together with Kenny and Hoy, that he fell on the track deliberately due to a bad departure.
He later withdrew his word, and British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time, there were no problems like this.
“The feeling was like London, all the flags of the UK fell in the audience.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory in the Olympics feels great.
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of ten railways in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, it will be a successful five-day debt.
As Kenny has shown, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy’s achievements and win three Olympic gold in one of the Olympics.
This would mean running an account on six gold medals and a shopping hall for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
It would be the same as in Hoy.
Kenny competes next in a spin that starts today and settles in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says, “I can only enjoy this moment.
The team is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.
“If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the value of the ritual.
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest of four teams.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012, which won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (klo 22.42) will compete today on the second day of competition, and the focus of the attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a dispute with competitors yesterday before the time when he was invited by the suppliers to measure his length.
In the same women's race, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavia achieved the world record time of 4:13.260.
The British team can now rely on its great cycling team to take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the actual extraordinary evidence from the full leadership position in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has been dramas, the least of which is the dismissal of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of claims related to sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night on the Velodrom show that Britain’s already legendary reputation rises to the top for once again.
The future of Portland’s melting industry in the light of the end of the electricity agreement
The future of the aluminum alloy operating in Portland in Victoria State, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, are at stake when the power company supplying electricity to the melting plant said that one of the owners of the factory is about to terminate the contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision made by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the aid for which the factory is kept in operation.
A fixed, 20-year-old aid will expire in November.
Alcoan Portland is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk due to the breakdowns.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting house consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melting plant, which resulted in the closure of the Anglo-Sea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland’s melting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculins used for years of the future of the factory, which were first caused by Australia’s strong dollar and the recent factory’s production price.
AGL, which delivers electricity to a large aluminium alloy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other melting plant owners to terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that it is waiting for the Portland production plant to continue to operate, which means that physical electricity demand is continuing from the melting plant.
The AGL states that the agreements are the so-called safeguard agreements which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The period of termination of contracts is 12 months, so they end in 2017.
“As a result, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million, as a pre-departure for the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts does not affect Alcoa's capacity to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting machine.
The American company announced that it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, even though it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn the agreement.
Due to the low economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessment of the melting plant in Portland and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
The CEO of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per week.
“If these plants leave the market, it means a significant decrease in demand (electricity) markets.
As a producer, it wouldn’t be good news,” says Mikkelsen.
Cardashianit TV star Kendall as a September Vogue cover girl
The fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue.
Kendall, a advertising plant of Estee Lauder and appeared in the fashions of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday.
“Looking at me in a room full of my loved ones got me tears,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just following the Cardashianit series style?), a handbooked video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barivers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite producer, Ryan Seacrest, who forgot his sister's cover. The video ends with a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichical, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of the program (Secrest says: “You thought we had forgotten you, as sincerely as a child’s morning-TV cartoon), but Krisin had to involve his other daughter in this public.
Its appearance in Vogue's September number means a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall's grandfather Kim could get to Vogue's office before (he appeared on Vogue's deck together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September is exactly his own class.
September number is Vogue's most sold publication per year.
In its packaging, the number that resembles a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (a fashion site from Fashion fell to 615 pages in the 832-page guide last year).
The publication of the letter of September is expected to be so intense that in the previous two years, the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before official publication.
Previously on September cover models, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel, and Kate Moss have been among others.
In recent years, there have been more famous celebrities working on the model than models that are celebrities.
Oscar's winner and Dior-Manoszavo Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he would rather read the famous works of the model, he is in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not known for relatives, real-TV stars or children of modern age who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
The Beyonce, who appeared in the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of his career, when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of its real TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be dark.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them \"darts\".
These emotions have re-energized the surface when the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, constant inconsistency seems unlikely.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for Vogue's September number.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs' fashion scene.
He's the advertising plant of Estee Lauder.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He sells photos of Cindy Crewford's daughter, whom he described for the LIVE magazine.
And in his free time, he appears on a real TV, maybe only as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be turned off from legal aid centres, and the sector will be prepared for the impact that additional cuts will already have on centres operating at extremes.
Three out of five people who apply for legal assistance and legal services are already being turned away – most of them are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified emigrations and similar injustices without resources to combat.
Public legal assistance services with already overburdened burden are preparing for additional cuts in the budget.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing 30% more from federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that according to the latest report prepared by the National Agency for Judicial Assistance Centers, thousands of people are already being turned off each year.
If the federal government doesn't round its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centres are constantly underrepresented, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the services they need when they seek,” Farrell said.
“People who go out of conflict-of-law relationships, people under the uncontrollable and unruly debt burden, families who differ, workers who are unwarrantedly fired – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of people with the weakest positions in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brand to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid to the national central level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Government of Palasczuki must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign against the threat of the worker by the gun
New York: The action against Donald Trump’s campaign was brought up when no action was assumed to have been taken since its leadership had been told that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint from former software trainer Vincent Bordini of the state campaign at the State Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be handled inside the campaign before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
In his statement, Bordini said that the campaign manager Earl Phillip put out a gun, put his right front finger on the trigger, and put pressure on Vincent's kneelash.
Following the complaint, the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same Phillip.
“Even if the gun doesn’t trigger, it causes damage,” says Bordini.
The Canne will only be two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused the general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of the second additional stop, who are considered as gun owners and armedmen, can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and can be elected judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media disbanded his word and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for uninterrupted and Phillip’s compensation for duplication, abuse and mental suffering.
Trump's informant Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him to comment.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB said Phillip recently left a campaign.
No immediate response was received to the Philip’s consultation company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a controversial campaign.

Britain must use the Olympic Spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates prosperity – not just in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow, and as in the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics were of enormous benefit to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, removing youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As in the London Olympics 2012, there are always people who believe that Heathrow’s expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face a awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles to be overcome will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is a infrastructure project that benefits many rather than the weak.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy with 211 billion pounds. It brings skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has carried out on time and by maintaining a budget of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5 terminal, which has been voted the best air terminal of the year in two consecutive years, and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two world’s most dirty runways.
They are now ready to produce the third runway, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee our future trading and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Delighton is the Chairman of Heathrow’s Board and former Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising in Cat Mouse
The efforts of companies that earn their online advertising to deceive advertising software have become a cat-hiiri-play, says one of the companies producing the prevention programmes.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced its website to block advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it told users that they could update their cookie software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes on its desktop website so that advertising programs are more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertisements.
However, Adblock says that he has discovered the new codes.
Adblock's informant Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that “a balling between the open source advertising community and the scammers has been underway since the ad application was invented, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repairs again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the struggle is a strong indication of the concern that advertisers have become in the industry.
Globally, 200 million people use advertising programs, according to the study by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has been nearly fourfold since 2013.
Facebook uses 1,03 million active users on mobile devices daily, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, as according to the informant, mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop advertising is still large enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced updating the advertising tool for user settings so that users can more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock’s new filters as it also prevents the appearance of some common Facebook writers.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem,” the Facebook reporter said in his email.
The advertising programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and therefore, instead, we have invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools to enable people to control the targeting of ads themselves.
The woman committed suicide by leaving cars under the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of witnesses on the motorway on Thursday's first accident, where the woman was deliberately left under more cars.
The accident occurred on A1 motorway near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate deed by setting her on the dark road, and hit her with more cars, says Vaud's police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her goal was clearly to commit suicide, and among the superior cars there was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified, and the police ask them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneve’s newspaper that criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges against drivers involved in the accident will be raised.
Is it impossible to avoid collision?
It's left to the prosecutor,\" says Hofstetter.
Over the last five years, two similar cases have occurred which do not constitute responsible drivers.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked in the dark motorway and the court decided that drivers could not expect to crash their pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police authority was released from the charge against him, which had been raised from the death penalty after he met a man who slept on the A1 motorway near Paynerne as one of August’s nights in 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had been drinking plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the method of driving the police – which was responding to the emergency call – was justified and the man lying on the road – was an exceptional and unforeseeable situation –
Every Thursday near Morges accident, some scientists are asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The purpose of the model was to find out whether the circumstances in Venus may have sometimes been similar to that on Earth, although Venus is hot and waterless and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations, Venus’s slow rotation speed is explained by its thick gas supply.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it has been slowly rotating.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of the early Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than in Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid degradation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
“In GISS’s modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its day-to-day is almost two months per day,” says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This heats the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The clouder works like a umbrella and protects the surface from large parts of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model created Venus's story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of the planetary scientists about its development cost.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billions of years.
Its oceans faded, and the ultraviolet light burned the steamed water.
In Vedy’s field of space, only a thick carbon dioxide gas stove and a deadly greenhouse effect – that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from his place as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the ice hockey industry, I appeal to the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the club will begin to apply for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I’ve done my job as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the vice president of the ice hockey industry, with a firm, passionate and determined attitude,” says Roy.
“I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Executive Director of the ice hockey activities of the trainer and the Society must be fully in the same lines with the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me of his decision today,\" said Sakic.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we hope for him everything good for the future.
Roy was awarded Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league year for his first time in the year 2013-2014 as Chief Coach of Avalanchen.
With his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won a central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the drop-off games and hasn't made it for the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the 2015-2016 period and remained five points from Minnesota Wild in the second Wild Card in the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups on his career – two in the Montreal Canadians and two in Avalanchen lines.
Oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators will report the suspension of the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea, when all parties in the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been held in warehouses with drill trucks under the management of the Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the joint statement of the Parties, \"Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to re-launch the process in order to resolve the dispute.
From the beginning of the next week, we will be holding a number of all-day meetings for the next few weeks, dealing with the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions established their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first to protest for more than 25 years, to potentially up to 30% of wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9% of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows the decrease in prices of contractors working in the country by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it a space of movement that is necessary for it to cope with the fall in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees on its pay list and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, which is how it seeks to improve its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower prices and economic situation of crude oil, resulting from the decision to leave the European Union in June, create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish member of Parliament, met with the Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major work reports that the North Sea has experienced in the whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
“In the Gulf Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that is of benefit to many and not just the few,” Anderson said.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, after spending around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pelade Star
The latest task of the Kepler Space Scoop has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped astronomers to collect the most comprehensive list of speeds of the stars in the Pjadie Star Force.
Based on the new data, astronomers are able to determine why the stars in the same star group run at different speeds and how the orbits relate to the planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age, and even about the history of its solar system,” says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University in Pasadena, in the press release.
The Piliadian Star Force is located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They are running faster than ever.
With the speed of cycling at the peak of the adult stars, large amounts of stars are dismantled.
These winds have a devastating effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation for each star by following the time between the appearance of the visible peaks (which corresponds to the sun clouds).
The latest listed rotation speed data suggests that larger stars run slower than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger bikes are slower than smaller ones.
“We see Plaade’s dance – that slowly rotating are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Piliad starset is so close, it works as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars in relation to the rotation speeds.
“The Piliadian Star Corps offers a support pillar for theoretical models that run both younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
We want to get a lot more information on how, when and why stars slow their rotation speed and stop their dance.
With Rebull colleagues, she will present her latest analysis of the speeds of spins in her three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
