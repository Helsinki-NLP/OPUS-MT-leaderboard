Camille Auer wanted to correct his sex, diagnosed as a mental illness, and now he makes art on the subject - \"Man should have the right to his own body.\"
There are ten patient reports from the roof of the project room at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them reads the name of Cameron Auer.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how external people have written their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
He decided who he is.
“I wanted to tell a person about my medical history so that the violence of the process would be visible,” Auer said.
In the process, he refers to the process of gender correction.
It is often a long-lasting study period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and physicians.
The process begins by sending a “sexual identity disorder” to diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
At Auer, the process began four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered on the internet and was in his very long repair process.
He felt he was a woman, but according to the Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the sex can be repaired legally.
Translaw, i.e. law transceived sex (563/2002) obliges transgender people to sterilization in order, for example, to get the right sex into the population register centre and passport.
At present, every gender remedy is required for psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive inability.
People have the right to decide their own bodies.
“This situation is intolerable and infringing human rights,” Auer said.
This reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations and the European Court of Human Rights is a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections and the Finns came to the government.
Now the law is stuck again.
This is a matter of internal policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The hospital does not want to raise it to the table because there are differences within the government to amend the law,” says Frank Johansson, CEO of Amnesty’s Finnish department.
The first part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the University Hospital Transpolitic Psychology in Auer.
The psychologist met Cami Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis, which should be defined for the treatment and assistance of Auer’s right.
The perception of the reality of the study appears to be exposed to horrificness.
The study’s perception of itself shows itself in a cross-border manner that is fragmented and unstable in personality.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer said.
There was even greater shock when Auer was not given sex replacement therapy.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was banned from his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and fired the transpolian waiting door for television.
Later on, that television was created by the art work called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and use of it.
“It’s crazy that any woman defined as a woman in birth can increase her breast, but a diagnosis needs to be removed,” Auer says.
Your body will not be yours if you feel that you are nothing more than the amount of sex you have defined in birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only quality.
The gender correction process is more severe for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passing through dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and have the right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help will be denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough,” Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have a mental symptom: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
In these cases, the healthcare staff may order that the treatment cannot be started.
“Despite care and assistance can cause a person to enter even worse situations than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auter’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer writes: “I’ve had self-destructive thoughts throughout my adult life, and that’s what people usually find difficult to melt.
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenager age.
Why the wide jaw did not feel suitable for its own body, and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of the flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic necessity.
“The father has to justify so much by speaking, wearing clothes, using sounds and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his coming sight, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the near-minded comments could hurt a lot.
Most of the time, it hurts when close relatives are wrong.
“They should know, and they know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to internalize it,” he said.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body resistance, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of their own sex.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And that's true.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-age applicant submits a written application for a new identity, stating that he or she is a second sex.
After half a year’s discretion, the applicant shall confirm its application in writing and the Ministry shall provide the applicant with a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also addressed by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic work collection.
I want to believe that art is still of great importance and that it can lead to political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization gave a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which is a leader in the civil rights of African Americans, has issued a travel warning for Missouri. The reason is the discriminatory practices of the State and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
“The NAACP Mission Travel Report will enter into force on 28 August 2017, calling for African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to observe extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been a number of controversial racial-based events,” the organization said.
The recent law in Missouri hampers the right to export cases of discrimination. In addition, the implementation of state law is disproportionately directed to minorities. According to the NACP, these factors led to travel warnings.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and assaulted or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NACP Missouri magazine, Kansas City Star.
“We have never heard of as many cases in a short period of time.
The travel information about Missouri is the first warning of the United States state.
The organization mentioned racist comments against African American students at Missouri University as well as the death of the 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in question earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ended with fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him, even though he was not charged with the crime.
The travel information also referred to Missouri's report by the Minister of Justice that the police would stop the black driver 75 percent more likely than the white one.
“The purpose of the travel information is to invite people to be guarded and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must prepare, for example, by including money for the payment of guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, in 2015, hundreds of storm crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies in the area of residence and discrimination in employment relations.
The Civil Rights Protection Organisation, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that oblige the police to arrest people from immigration offences. According to the organization, this increases racial-based profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintila asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension of the CEO
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (centrally.) has requested Finnair to report on the additional pension paid by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramon, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is contrary to the government's will.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130,000 received by Varamon was raised this week when Helsinki’s Sanomat announced the award development of directors of stock exchange companies.
The Finnish Film magazine announced Vauramon’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said he would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The state has agreed not to use additional pensions for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year’s corporate governance policy decision.
The sanctions were immediately closed.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
In the context of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be doing well.
Then the atmosphere has cooled significantly.
The new economic sanctions signed last week by the Congress of the United States and signed at Trump on Wednesday were very difficult to respond to in Russia.
The most serious answer has been heard so far from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which states that the mandatory act signed by Trump means a “full-scale trade war”.
Although Russian reactions would only be subject to political rhetoric as cuts and overtimes, the tension between the United States and Russia is the fact after the short term after Trump’s election.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass the Penal Code on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress adopted the law with considerable consensus, but the adoption of the law to the President was much more difficult to say.
Trump criticises his newly signed law as a lack of meaning.
President Trump must have been the cause of the war, especially Russia, even though the adoption of a law limiting his own powers must have been offensive.
As well as well known, there is an investigation in the United States about the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign in Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of coercion.
Once the White House staff has switched to a hole and a variety of Scandinavian translations have been revealed to some extent to update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not carried out in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the president.
Such a situation is not desirable in any way.
If Russia’s relationship is a breakthrough in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is exacerbated by relations.
The EU has clearly demonstrated the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Although the Union has remained at least uniform on the top of its policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
Russia, like Finland, has been a major trading member country, and economic sanctions have been a real issue.
The impact of the U.S. sanctions is still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make the operations of many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, for example, the effects can be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has led to the exclusion of, for example, liquid natural gas from the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a way of showing evil in world politics.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more damaging than they are beneficial.
Isn't nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Liberty
The absence of the statues is a sure sign of change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, lost it in a statue of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s main intellectuals, knew well what he was doing in an intense debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The patent statue was subjected to Miller’s attack in a vocabulary that concerned the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really judge the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have caught a huge flock of cruise organizers and immemorial characters from the statue of Liberty.
His attack was aimed at the importance of the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903, the statue was added to Emma Lazarus’ poem – 17 years after the statue was completed.
As Miller wrote, “I don’t want to go in more detail in its history, but the statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom all over the world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Freedom Pass.
Miller was not wrong himself, but it is not just history, as he said.
These are the words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the state invites not only immigrants, but also “the narrowest of the poor,”: “Your Tired, your poror, / Your hudled masses yearning to breathe free, / The created resource of your teaming shell –
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller did not practice literature criticism, and he made it clear that “the poorest ones” are not welcome to Trump’s United States.
It is part of a broader political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be fastened to the statue of their feet. They knew very well that the act was politically political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, a feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but it has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: a deported mother.
It was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh, a guide that can now be regarded as some kind of prediction of Trump, claimed that the Statue of Liberty is not called to anyone, but is a early pioneer of the neoconservatives who takes the US to the darkness to cover the world: “Lady Liberty is coming out.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The show does not show the way to the United States.
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the statue of liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and the exhausted, but the desire for migrants from the ship's deck after a long and challenging journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for better life.
His Son of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and wishing to welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their mouth does not show the way, but the flames of anger, their only source of power.
General Sports World Championship 2017: Neil Black boasts Scottish members of the UK National Team
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two Scottishs got to the UK National Team
Neil Black, CEO of the UK League of Sports, says that 16 Scottish members of the World Championship are \"a significant confirmation\".
A record of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Cup in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is going to happen in Scotland, something that Britain’s general sport needs to learn.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what the question is,” Black says.
“I spoke with the representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the work of the Institute.
The Scottish League of Sports believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
And the British League of Sports believes that it is behind them.
And the usual street operator thinks he has something to do with it.
But it’s something really great, which is why...
Many Scottish athletes compete in London seriously on medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competed with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres.
“Neidh is too modest.
His speech was incredible, Black says.
“The athletes left the opportunity proud of their achievements and highly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eidith’s words had a real feeling and passion for sports.
Eilith Doyle is a shopping player in the League’s championships at 400 metres, and these are his fifth world championship. He thinks it’s “incredible – that the national team has 16 series.
The previous record was from seven years 1983 and 2015.
During the year, the mid-travel runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European record.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 meters in London. It is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season, which includes winnings in the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only one hit his team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the county team says he is “provenly proud of the fact that there are so many strokes involved, some of which are actually competing for final places and medals.
“It’s a great honour to have access as a cabinet, but it’s even more special because the crew members voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“I am, of course, very proud of all the scooters that got into the country team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are part of the award-winning athletes who compete with the award-winning players.
Captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the community and the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing.
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you don’t withstand criticism
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics for his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated me,
But he didn't silence his critics.
“If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and silent as sheep for slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
That's why we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights League challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unjustified, and his attitude was also depressing online.
This is just Facebook, a lot of comments.
But this is important,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the state of democratic control.
He has received the second best estimate of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has led the state firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main contact channel for his constituents and published a picture of his hairstyleed head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users coming to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains in tax resources.
Hogan's informant, Amelia Chase, defended the governor in his interview with Washington Post.
However, it is too easy to label commentators as trolls, symphony or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users on Hogan's Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose. They were not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, kind and relevant.
The pastor borrowed his comments from the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Maryland’s Bowie, was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
“I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in Washington Post’s comments.
“I can’t accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and ignore the people who are concerned as a large group.
The governor’s staff called comments “a central attack,” one might call them important things.
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
Before the old age, the staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical headlines, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It is really the same thing, but now it is only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of clashing Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump's blocked Twitter users have challenged him to court.
The first major decision was made in Virginia last week.
According to Alexandria’s judge James C. Cacheris, the government of the Loudoun County violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution by preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. League of Civil Liberties discussed the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At Washington’s time, cheap mail payments had a similar effect on the internet today.
The number of newspapers was fourfold from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers were messing with Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers where they called for Washington's decisions.
The President's office has received appeals that criticise Jay's agreement, the United States-UK cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
Real leadership means acceptance of this fact.
The summer food for birds should be stopped immediately
The samples have come from about half a place, and also online notifications from a couple of three.
Most of them have come from South and Varsinais Finland, but then also individuals from Haapaved and the Wall, special researcher Marja Isamursu Evira.
Vegetables are dead to the tricomonosis.
It is a scientific source called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit helmets, and especially to wear them.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in the wild birds.
In 2009, he went well.
At that time, the tricomonosis caused a big collapse in Finland in the field of greening, and after which the stock of the species had been on the way to recovery.
There have been sick greens now, but at least not yet in a large scale, Juha Honkala, a museum director at the University of Helsinki, said.
It can be feared that the previous epidemic of green peppers will be renewed again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the bird’s summer meal immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping to benefit from a home trip at the Renaissance Club.
The former European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field trip for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organise the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
The Northern Irish Rafferty last year led the tournament held next to the Archerfield Links, before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has preferred a new place and works as a broadcaster for the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be able to complete its glory,” Rafferty said.
“The players see the field at their best, and it’s in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's a game-inspiring ambassador, and he's proud of his time-outs here.
The tournament is a great show for this field.
The English Eagles defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won his 32-year career on both the European tour and the European challenger tour.
“This feels like a very special opportunity,” the player in Southport says.
“I couldn’t defend Extremely Open’s victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back to mind: the tournament was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.
Gary Orr goes back to the real deal on his own soil, and he went to the tour after 50 years of being completed this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“Toying in the home is always more important,” says Orr, located in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with the mirror so far.
The three will be followed by former Masters Winner Ian Wosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNultyn.
The tournament takes part in six sets: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver in the car, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All revenue is donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organization.
The cabin was covered with potential indoor air problems.
At the Säkylä, at least no internal air problems have been found in Pori's private message company's chamber building, which was reported on Thursday.
Internal air studies will continue.
The study began when a man who stopped his car service for health reasons thought his health was weakened due to the poor indoor air of the chamber.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the head of the Pori Brigade has not found any problems in the health situation of other carers.
It turned out that it was an individual age, and other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to find out this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem,\" Holma says.
The Privacy Notice states that due to the arrival of July, goods must have been transferred to the chambers, which is why dust may have increased at a moment.
The air may have been intrusive because of it, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Golden Country
Bardina Degei doesn't use her cooking plant.
He rarely uses the roof.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batatin – locally-notat – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the satat burned to the cart will be eaten with a bare, washless hand.
Degei's home has no furniture. He sits on a mud painting, where he usually treats his daily ass, such as washing in the same water that was applied for from the nearby salt of the laundry.
The office will be delivered by a bucket in the impeccable room.
Degei is the youngest of his four wives, and he has not been assigned fields to be treated.
Multi-maritality is common here.
Later work can be dangerous: most of the people in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the soldiers.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five nights,” Degei says.
This is a rare curvature in the tops of the Ark, the former Dutch colony, which was linked to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum, where the 1 026 village price was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement against Dutch power quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which holds the area strictly under its control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was formally distributed to Papua and Western Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is a remote and cognac. The journey begins on a half-hour flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the stomach in the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19 000 inhabitants, there are trees surrounded by bamboo trees, with aerobics of rust dyed into cellars.
Only few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have happened.
“We didn’t have any such clothes,” Degei says. He means colorful, hand-bonded catalyse, dark skirt and bright color to the pusero.
“Before, we only had leaves covered with our bodies,” he said.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also a gold country in Indonesia.
Pania is about the top of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grassberg, the world’s largest and most productive gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have $78 billion of timber reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, as they mean a strong military presence in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military staff and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004.
The demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 parrots and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths in the tops of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were measured by genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in the region in peaceful demonstrations.
We Will Lose Everything 2016 reports on the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and unlucky attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because the cases are weekly,” says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been tightened when the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provins, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Indonesia’s population from Japan, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes is changing in the hope of a better livelihood.
The Japanese Warung dishes sell fried chicken and gado-gado-gado in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“The changers have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market at cheaper than the locals,” says Abeth You, 24 years old, who is from Panama and moved to the province capital after work.
The local women lost their customers.
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo – Jokowi – promised to intervene in the 2014 election campaign in Papua infringements and human rights violations.
Papa consists of 29 regions, and this former wooden cap won a vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s presidential town.
But only a little has changed to Papua, and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” says You.
Pania experienced some kind of wave base for just two months after Jokowin's lockouts.
The eleven children were singing Christmas songs on adolescence at Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the lights.
Another soldier did not like the remark, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to reports of victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
So one of the soldiers shot at children.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yemino, retired as a result of a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the government electoral committee located near the venue was lit and the next day began.
About a thousand parrots – young men and women and children – gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They had the hunting springs for celebrations, and they began to present the traditional waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where they danced around and traced bird singing.
Some protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers were given an order in the internal radio system: “If the crowds do more than three times, shoot them to death,” the information is based on the official document of the TIME magazine, which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, Kego Koto, a resident leader of the region of Kego Koto, acquitted the situation from the arm and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot on the left hand side,” he told the TIE magazine on the cover of his wooden house painted brightly.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the lines of the soldiers.
“There were a number of shots shot in the conscience.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, his cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him and made sure that it was really him,” told Yohanes TIE magazine, sad, and, like many Indonesians, he used only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him,” he said.
Police officer Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only protected the police station because it was under attack.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Pudjo Sulistiya in 2015.
“It’s about life and death,” he said.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The death data came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapur, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
“I want the case to be examined immediately so that there will never be any such thing again.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said he would launch reports on human rights violations outside the legal system.
But he started to cancel his speech immediately.
“A lot of violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate the crimes, but it needs certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind.
“Everything is settled in court,” he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of crimes against humanity – Crimes are related to the death of more than a thousand people in the Eastern Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, Wiranto told TIM that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the events in Panama.
The families of the victims of the Paniai have a deep disbelief view of the allegations.
“I’ve been interviewed four times over the past three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” says Yohanes.
“I’m tired of this.
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
\"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm being shot...
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panicists are not afraid to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the victims are buried,” he said.
The shootings have not ended.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighboring area of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the leader refused to take the man who lost his consciousness to the hospital. Among the injured there were also children.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught fishing on a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers showed their mind on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, Indonesia's semi-military police unit opened fire to the crowd, when one of the villagers was killed.
“We are terrified of revenge,” says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shot-in police officers to be held accountable and the withdrawal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem with the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes that live in Papua's wheat at the midlifes.
Many have joined the Refugee Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Palestinians in random attacks and the kidnappings of the Indonesian army's soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by holding up the rebellion and by impoverishing thousands of people in Panama – in the name of securing national sovereignty.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Baptists, Pani is known as “sururish, forgotten place”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
Enarotal has only a little rice for sale, and it is too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly batats and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Viljely is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five batats.
Most of the rain is for the family, and the rest is sold on the cake.
Ten Batats only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the income of local and migrants have increased, and the number of variables has increased since new routes were opened to the Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go better for more educated and wealthy migrants.
Only a few payees have sufficient capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
“The young people don’t want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money here,” says John Gobai, president of the Pania tribe council.
The syre Papua stays with little attention in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international news remain stringent.
Previously, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been given a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises. He has not increased transparency and did not promote development by removing restrictions on news.
“Indonesia’s most restless Eastern provinces from Papua and Western Papua news providers have new risks: refusal of visa and entry to the black list,” Kine said in his statement.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that the Government of Indonesia is under pressure only by the neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the Papua and widespread violations, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the free movement of Papua.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arrmanatha Nasir, denied the accusations and told reporters in Jakarta, that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so that it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.
Locals want foreign authorities to be lacking.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Barari, visited Jayapura on 4.5.2017, the locals violated silence and expressed their desire for freedom, the meeting was presented by an anonymous permanent source.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the parrots say that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in a shooting scene in Panama,” Gobai said.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the panicists: they live under the power of the greedy and unpredictable army in lack and poverty, practically without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the panicites, such as the other parrots, consider the voices they have given to Jokow as a brother, which must be paid back.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting had once again demonstrated a conflict in a symbolic manner: they buried one of the victims of the police station and the military office in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not allow the responsible to forget their crimes.
“My family member was killed,” Yacobus says.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora is calling for Robert Helena’s replay: “Even her own fans don’t want to see...
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of the heavy series of boxers were supposed to be in Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
However, the deal was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora is shooting in a new ILL TV interview for the reason of the replaying to Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland was floped, but it wasn't my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him take care of, because he's dirty, Chisora is bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the new match went smoothly, and Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom that the match had been moved to autumn.
The deal has not been new.
However, the withdrawal will no longer be dire to Chisora.
In any case, the contest would have to be cancelled if Chisora was sick.
Thursday, three days before the match time, I woke up with a lot of pain.
The barrel was exploded.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says he's in about 45 percent condition right now.
He is not interested in replaying Helenius, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss in December.
You've come to another power at the Torch Cloud Designer in Dubai.
The flames captured the world's tallest living building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee from a 37-metre high 79-layer building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building called Torch.
The building was cleared and no one was known to have been injured, and for the reason of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
“We were asleep and awakened to the voice of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran the stairs down from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, and the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the security authorities in Dubai, the fire was shut down at four o’clock in the morning and left to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange an accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case can raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch Building Board carried out a study that found out that the most harm to public networks and insulation records were the most affected.
In the UK, the police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulation and curtain plates could contribute to the rapid advancement of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
The park was stolen during the night.
The parking lot was stolen on Tuesday at 21 am and between 5 pm.
Mopo disappeared from Niivaari at Tikkamäe 2.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers are involved in the aircraft with prohibited items, reveal a survey
A survey survey conducted by air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items knowingly or unaware of their planes through the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA) inspection points. At least six percent of passengers were knives or other steel-equipped objects that they knew were not prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only recently learned that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives in trouble.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire, and it was carried out by Statos Jet Charters, which also reveals that young passengers are threatening the rules more likely.
19.7% of passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15% belonged to the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids into the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that they had exported steel-equipped objects consciously to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had taken banned drugs consciously to the aircraft.
The survey was carried out by the U.S., and the company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the smuggling goods had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travelers are also most likely to pass security checks – consciously or unconsciously.
But, as the company who did the survey says, the TSA guidelines are quite complicated and confusing.
Travelers often don’t know what fluids can be taken into the plane and how much.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the majority of TSA’s detainees are liquids.
For some time, there was also a thought that no books should be taken to the plane.
You can take the nets for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, passed his decision to delay the decisions made during the Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had challenged the law of the Director of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke emissions during the Obama regime.
According to Prutit, the change shows that the agency that he has led takes better account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the States.
Pruitt did not mention the action brought against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should begin to comply with the 2015 ground ozone requirement as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move the implementation of decisions forward by one year in order to have more time for his agency to familiarise themselves with the plan, because the Agency does not want to intervene in local decision-making or harm economic growth.
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of EPA, and the Pruitt is known as the opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
After coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest return to the Pruitt plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that, in attempting to delay the implementation of the decision of the oil and gas companies’ management of the oil and gas companies, the Director of the EPA had the right to monitor and reduce the number of methane years.
In its statement on Wednesday, Mr Pruitt claimed that only in relation to his full translation of the ozone regulations would strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
“In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines, and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to enter into an agreement on timetables,” Pruitt said.
“We do not believe in the regulation of proceedings and we take time-limits seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and the mandates that we give to us.
However, the EPA Opinion found that Pruitt could continue to use its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
The Republicans in Congress drive a broader change in ozone regulations.
The purpose of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman of New York State, who was in court this week, said the group was going to continue the pressure.
“EPA’s mental change as a result of our complaints is a significant profit for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to direct effects of smoke in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the surface is generated when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This may cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups, and it is also part of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmental protectors welcomed the surprising change in the direction of Pruitt.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy who was responsible for the air of our breathing used a healthy sense,” says Lori Ann Burd from the center of Biological Diversity.
“We have to fight against the regime of Trump, as its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of the polluters and other groups of their own interests.
The Supercar manufacturer is becoming a street masturbator - an event in Ferrari's style -
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchinne said plans at the information conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News announced.
All East Savo ash cases of the same type of virus
The coastal herb infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, informs THL.
The virology laboratory of the health and well-being facility has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth insect infection in East Savo is the same virus strain with previous infections.
THL has ensured that an coastal person has been confirmed on Friday, 28 July by the same type of virus as previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all the infections found in East Savo are related to the first ashpox found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not developed any other types of ash-free virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth disease could still occur between August and August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for the basic health of Soster, who is responsible for infectious diseases.
New ashtrays or their doubts have not been revealed since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds us.

Finland prepares for a promising race
It was not even considered to be legalized.
The background is that the process produces in addition to the wine methane, which is toxic.
The production of a shield at home is legal next year, but the legalization of a score is not even considered.
The shield is made by use, and the point is again by distillation.
The background behind the regulation of the Tislaus is the fact that the process produces methane in addition to the wine, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the cumbersome of points to the right of every human being, the Ismo Ismo of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the Alcohol Act, no legalisation was considered.
It was not a political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalization of distillation, Outi Mäkelä (kok.) said.
He is a negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the Government Party, who took the position of reforming the Alcohol Act.
You can’t even give permission to distill at home in the future.
Commercial production is also permitted.
Importing says that there is a simple rule for the preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be produced at home.
This means that, in addition to beer, sider and wine, you can do a legal race at home.
The government wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavourings and enables the production of the shield, Mäkelä will specify.
The preparation must continue to take place in such a way that the ingredients or flavourings produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable in drinking.
Under the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as they want, and alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must still not be placed on sale.
The act of exclusion is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuminen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft alcohol law is now subject to review by the Ministry of Justice.
Alcohol law will be processed by the Parliament as soon as the season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, the Mäkelä will rejoice.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pain, was tortured to the South African hospital for heart attacks.
The hospital is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is in prison in Attendgeville.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison reporter confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
In turn, the reporter of the family told me that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-fold Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked literations of phone conversations to Washington Post.
Trump called on Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speech on 27 January 2017 to stop paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto on the fact that this was a mess with the wall project in public. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a literation of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during the call, and there was a strong exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia must be \"swit,\" \"silent, and \"silent\", according to Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama season would make him look like an idiot, because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump quit the call by telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call all day.
Georgia's massacre: Activists re-created in the hope of racist lynching justice
Ford Mercury’s car passes the crowd in Monroe’s small town in Georgia and continues its journey towards the bridge of the little Moore’s Ford.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car. Four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the river, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped dress, takes a deep breath through the cigar and strangles through the windshield.
Travelers are scared.
\"Roger, the n--u-man's abbreviation.
“Out of the car –
The rumors break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-transmission, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the shocks are real when the hanger is rubbed in the neck of the Roger.
Since 2005, Human Rights Organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to remodel the events of 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan postponed two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been accused of murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the re-introduction arrangements.
“It’s a shame in history, but above all, it’s a burden that weighs on our soul.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
It is a disgraceful call for him to function, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice. We want things to be finally completed, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” Brooks said.
“We can’t recover and make a deal until we get justice.
The M.O. will cover the dead victim's body in Georgia's massacre on 27.7.46.
According to the FBI documents received by the NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of delay from Monroe and its surrounding districts.
No one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, the activists have always known the motives for lynching: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Black People of the State of Georgia had the highest right to vote for the first time in presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, an incident occurred in which the black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently touched Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city had a relationship with Dorothy and Dorothy was waiting for her child.
According to the FBI, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 for Malcom to be released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The force stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
“It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murders,” the FBI reports.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed evidence and did not reveal the identity of witnesses.
Brooks is more at the heart of the matter.
“It was a voter’s murder,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to inform the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been directing Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and imprisonable. It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe is already lost in today’s United States.
It's hard to look at the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we had to face our own dark side,” the director said.
“But I can’t make a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or you don’t want to hear what I’ve had to experience.
On the first day of June, about 30 actors – ten of the blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh works as Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and offensive.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” says Marbaugh.
“It’s important, however, that this side of history is held to never be repeated again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester train.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and snores Hester, and he is angry with the fact that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
I told you to leave my country, n-u-
Rascona or Hester will answer.
Then we'll get the shot.
And then, all (at least all black actors) are laughter.
Greene laughs harder.
- What? - Rascona asks.
He's in trouble.
“I accidentally found too strong,” he asked.
\"No, Greene's burning.
“I just don’t think the whites used the word ‘-’ at that time.
So, another black actor confirms.
“It’s a slang. You need to use a longer version.
The subject is unpleasant, but the room's power is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who died.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now, Rascona's words are squeaking.
No one laughs.
Re-transmission ceases quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken in every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty viewers wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the population is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca in New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited Brooks’ graves in the pressing humidity of Georgia.
The murders have become true of the story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children are able to look at artificial blood and immobilized bodies and whisper each other.
“They’re not really dead,” the little boy shows up as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
Actors who presented the gypsies take away their sign and wipe tears.
Bradshaw is a man who has been nominated by the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after the hard show.
“It’s okay, the woman who was involved in the show will comfort you.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta will sincerely discuss the presentation with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the show.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible things that say and do people who look the same as you, precisely because they look the same as you,” he says.
“I found that there was still a delay,” he added. “They were just called arrests.
On the other side of the room Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the hearings sitting on the same table.
He says he's already started planning the next year's presentation.
“The resuscitation is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors of our chemistry, but it is also a teaching experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.
Growing of plants in shops is really saving: This amount – with the removal of additional parts
Is it allowed to remove the floral leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking away a big hat from the anana... it's gonna weigh just how much?
The answers are strongly shared: for one, it is an indication of the most extremely spent doll, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used and that go home to the trash.
The report will be identified in the shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the Rooholahden K-Citymarket’s vegetable department in Helsinki, as many rip off the leaves of the florist, for example.
From the warehouse, the leaves are traded to bio-waste.
According to the news published by economics, crying at the vegetabletsky surprises traders.
But how much to remove excess parts of vegetables before weighing really saves money?
How important is the way of snoring really?
We women test how the price changes when the anana, late-artisc, delicious, parasacal and floral take off the leaves or strains.
Floral: €2.10 for the price of the florist was €1.80 when peeled out all the leaves.
Ananas: The price of the whole pineapple paid for EUR 2,30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its position was pulled off.
Latva-artisocka: EUR 2,60 came from the price of EUR 2,40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Two delicates cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Parsacal: The average size of the broccoli paid EUR 1 and without carrying 80 cents.
End result: If the leaves and stocks go off, save a few tens of cents at best for one vegetable.
In percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
These purchases would therefore save a total of 1,20 euros!
Neymar was taken out of Barcelona - the brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazil's lawyer Neymar has signed a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid the FC Barcelona 222 million euros for the withdrawal price in the Spanish league.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from Paul Pogba.
Spain too braked the transfer earlier on Thursday, when it abandoned the first payment company of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the rules of the League, the buying company cannot pay the withdrawal price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to the new home public at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa investigates details
In addition, Barcelona announced its information on the payment of the European Football Union to Uefa in order to enable the Union to determine the disciplinary measures that may arise from the case.
Mr. Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that the PSG would break the rules of the Ufa economic fair game.
Uefa can punish a company that will lose more than 30 million euros in three years.
According to Ufa, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically break its economic policy.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the company’s economy for several years, but it cannot be evaluated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players in significant amounts, Uepha was reported.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
Former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi, is the chairman of the Society.
Gym for Neymar
Austin, 21, got a lot of burns from the lightning attack - the stamp was stored in the airport's security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work measures on a plane at the International Airport of the Lounas-Florida with a couple of colleagues when he suddenly hit a plane from the rain sky.
The power of the lightning threw a plane near the wing of the plane into the land of Dunn.
Dunn was in a hospital.
He had third-degree burns around his body.
My father called me and said he got an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, but Austin's sister, Autumn, says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and stroke.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airline’s representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport movement itself decides whether to follow it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and stimulates business dividends by cutting
On Friday, British training group Pearson announced that he would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressure on his business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third savings programme aimed at revitalizing the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
In the last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that he would keep his current year’s vision unchanged, and its turnover increased by a half-year and was £2.5 billion.
Attacked in Kabul: Naton's soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber hit a military facility in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, the attack was killed by NATO's soldier and several others wounded.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul also killed three civilians.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
According to NATO's opinion, the Thursday-night explosion occurred when the NATO-Afghan military forces had been attacked by a person by self-determination device.
The report noted that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the writers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO’s troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, the area where mainly Shiiamuslims live.
Taliba said he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in Kabul, which was the most devastating attack on the country's militant group after the U.S.-led forces hit Taliban power in 2001.
The violence emphasizes Afghanistan’s unstable situation when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to writers, suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA runs its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke-free provisions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency passed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke emissions during the Obama administrative period after 15 states had challenged the law of the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called ozone definitions for 2015, late Wednesday. According to the Agency, the decision shows its commitment to co-operation with the States.
“We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states,” said Scott Pruitt in the Agency’s statement.
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations for one year for October 2018. According to definitions, the rate of smoke smoke is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the Office challenged 15 mainly democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, and the suspension of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama. According to Trump, measures are part of a broader programme of economic growth.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to EPA websites, breathing with ozone may impair the functioning of the lungs and increase breathing symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who was in charge of his father’s leadership had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company stopped before the security check.
The police don't tell us why the company broke up.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas-extinguishing device and take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport tool.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police patrols on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels worked well
The result of the oil refiner Neste fell before taxes, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volume of renewable products rose to record level, and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profits improved US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will have the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match for the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kilos, met on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports station in Los Angeles until WBC’s unwinning light-series master Mikey Garcia walked along the corridor to greet Lomatchenko, the master of the WBO’s upper-series series.
Garcia won on Saturday at Showtime with a unanimous decision by the former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. After that, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the top five weight-class boxers on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched her right hand and asked: “How are you, Master?
Good luck in the game.
Lomatšenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN channel on seven Saturdays.
When the twin poses for photographers, Lomatšenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be perfect for dogs.
\"I'm a former poor man, Garcia reminded me.
“I’m going to make the series higher [63.5 pounds] for the Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm a small size 63.5 kilo.
I want to go back to the light series.
He must rise to the light series [61.2 pounds], and then we can take it.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fill their wishes.
Lomatchenko agreed.
“Nerkking needs this game –
Klimas asked whether the match should be held on the payment channel. It is part of his strategy to make Lomatšenko debytoi in the light series later this year and will take the next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 barrel wins). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take a light series at Forum on 23 September.
\"The deal could be on the payment channel, because fans have asked for it, Garcia said and later announced she was ready to take the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets so much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement.
Garcia said she appreciates Lomatchenko as an unbelievably actress, and she might want to go see the Saturday match.
Lomatchenko cut off the praise of Garcia and said that this three-class master from Riverside seemed to be a slow one. Sori, Mike... but you needed it to be shattered.
Garcia said she was focused on showing the impact force and then boxing.
The men said they knew that the match between them would be more and more effective.
This is the match that is expected.
No other match is getting so much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case,\" Garcia said.
Lomatšenko said he was waiting to get to the best. “Mkey is a legend.
It will be a great match.
Average wage of EUR 5 300, training of what happens - the situation of investment advice has been – wild and free
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last time, Helsinki’s Sanomat told Ritt, 68, to whom the banker’s investment advisors spoke of a full pump when selling investment products.
Investment advisors and rules on the sale of different investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The gap is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is based primarily on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the skills requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service perform its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has been open to the organisation of a degree in the organisation of the APV investment studies Oy, with experts from both the Financial Supervision Board (Fiva), universities and industry actors.
The studies are available at 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, a Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are quite broad in terms of requirements.
The study materials include 10-15 books, as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Oy, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70.
All investment services provided by the largest banks have performed either APV1 or APV2, as they are mandatory in accordance with their own rules.
Then there are smaller banker movements without mentioning whose staff seems to have done a map of qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, such banker movements are \"changes\".
According to Savikko, APV1 has been completed since 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 people and recommended APV2 qualifications for more demanding investment advisors.
Some bankers consider that a qualification is an advantage.
Many other sectors have much more stringent skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Sector requires the completion of the APVs, as it will then be necessary to ensure the knowledge of the investment sector.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros in a month, including commissions, natural benefits and income rewards.
The average monthly working time of the employees is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working on the job earn an amount of EUR 5 900 per month, and women earn more than EUR 4,500, respectively.
The tens of those who make the most of the money earn an average of around €8 100.
The tenth of the most lucrative men earns more than EUR 9,000 per month or more, a tenth of the women who make the most of the women earn a dollar of EUR 6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Service Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, self-regulation has been trusted at the level of work and task.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it received individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the activities of the adviser.
In principle, investment products can also act as a seller, even if skills and qualifications are at a flexible level.
In this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
Most of the other industries have much more stringent knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be strengthened by the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to ensure that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, in turn, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and investment products sellers.
According to Hovi, the new requirements concern both the staff of investment firms and the affiliates who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the Government’s proposal by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva receives the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are precisely, these views will be decided during the coming autumn.
The company will also be required to ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation to show that this has also been done.
For example, in practice, the company must identify the staff’s activities at the individual level.
This will certainly be different requirements depending on whether investment advice or product sales are concerned.
According to Hovi, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced than a time limit if knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
In other words, if the company employs a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person meeting the criteria for a certain time.
As a result of the change, the rules are tightened and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra's blue coastal schoolers don't stop raining or sun-painting - Iines Allkonen's shelf with the help of the swimming pool
In fact, I went on a good track, Taina Ikonen followed.

The sun baked and young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with swimsuit bathrobes, someone without it.

The unknown soldier sells toilet drills - This is a very confusing story.
Everything you see.
A cleaning product was launched a couple of days ago by an unidentified military product series.
That's, you know, t-shirts and towels, as well as a-wc brush on the edge brush...
In this autumn, an unknown soldier refers to the film and the film marketing.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been disconnected from social media: When will the unidentified health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Vice President Aino Määt say?
We're the film's partner.
We are supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural film, Mätät says.
He said that the products will become a special feature, and the film will thus have visibility.
Isn't there something funny here - often when you think that the products and the related stories have something in common?
Yes, here’s a confusing story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, Mätät says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that support those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
Cleaning is not a guest to military culture, Mätä points out.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Salido, VR and Sato.
For example, Hartwall's vichy has been introduced on the market, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been perpetrated by the blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and clocks available.
Kinnunen notes that there is still time for the movie's first night, so the rest is still in the promise.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, the Valio, the Developer, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tested were identified to be over 18 years old. However, not all of them are considered reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be evaluated more closely than the age of the asylum seeker. The new test was introduced after the Swedish immigration agency was criticised for failing to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the Legal Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. Tests were carried out between mid-March and end July 2017.
The 80 % test, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, was defined to be over 18 years old. In addition, the Legal Medicine Agency identified 25 cases that the test was to be carried out by 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker may be under 18 years of age.
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age of the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Legal Medicine Agency says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
“The licenses are quite uniform. There are no major differences in the statistics of the previous months,” he told The Local magazine.
Although a large number of applicants were identified to be over 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and announced that in 442 cases, there were - references to the need to investigate 18 years of age or older.
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told him to complete this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used in tests takes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then dentists and radicals analyze images. The method is also criticized.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinian Institute, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can determine whether a person has become a normal breakage earlier or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age, we shouldn’t pretend we can do it,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göranssson defended the accuracy of the tests: “It can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be completed 18 years. Then the risk will be about 10%.
Ilone collapsed 30 locations in Scotland
Five more par results in the third round were spent on Mikko Ilosen 30 pyres on the print cloth downwards in the golf European tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday day 11 but was found at the end of the round to divide 41.
Illustration was a double-bogi in a heavy basement with three bugs.
Others were difficult, too.
The English Ian Poulter ascended to divide the tip of one under the bar tour, although he said that there was a lot of work in the umbrellas.
The tongue was raw, but I was hanging with it, and eventually the day was good, Poulter wind.
He's sharing a lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and the Australian Andrew Dodt.
the Governor of West Virginia to change the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night at Trump's campaign event in exchange for a party.
“The Democrats simply abandoned me,” Justice said.
“Today, I can tell you many prayers and in-depth reflection... today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as a governor of the Democrats.
The public broke up with a rough popularity.
“I registered as a member of the Republican Party on Tuesday,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say to you that it’s time for a new game,” he said.
Trump previously promised to make a significant announcement at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia at 42 points, because Justice did not support the Democratic Candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016 according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an opinion stating that “a new attack on a democratic party by Governor Justice, rather than on a better America, is a new one.
“Democracy has only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s notification is the last return to a party with no leadership and cannot find a positive message that unites people,” said Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the CIA, in his statement to CBS.
The lightnings have sown damage - Thursdays are coming up even a very late summer.
In the end of the week, we will also be able to add more holes to South Finland.
Over the past week, the country’s middle and northern parts, as well as the region of Varsinais-Suomen, have collapsed.
On the night between mid-week and Thursday, lightning strikes lit several fires.
According to Meteorologist, Thursday may be a very late summer.
The Ukrainians have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, in particular in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Finnish.
On the table, the lightning hit the power center of the row house, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received an announcement of the fire about a guard without a half-night on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
The rescue plant cut the ceiling and the wall to find firefighters and then shut the fire victuately.
The total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
In the lobby, the lightning lit the outside building into manifestations in Harjuland before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could not stop the fire from spreading.
About fifty square meters of outdoor construction burned the ground to the level.
In the direction of Kuopio, the lightning hit the home.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stamping lightning strike.
The rescue unit went right there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get a fire at the time - only a few melts hit.
In traffic, the thunderstorm caused problems on the train track between the Wall River and Vaasa, when lightning damage the traffic control system.
The error was reported on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was resolved only a little before five in the afternoon.
From then on, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with the gap of rail.
The lightnings have destroyed Finland across the globe.
However, lightning has been relatively small this summer.
These summer thunderstorms have been a waste of time! is an assessment of the emergency meteorologist Jari Tuuvinen.
In the middle of the week and Thursday, the worms have been mostly moderate in their strength, but thanks to the little lightning salad in the summer, it also seems to be strong in many even.
This may seem like a really hard old man, but that’s what it’s been compared to the summer’s worms,” Tuuvinen says.
On Wednesday, the earthquakes exploded 1,700 times, and on Thursdays there has been a potential even for the toughest day of the summer: around 16 o’clock there were 1,790 lands in the patch.
If the lightning continues on the start of the evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuuvinen predicts.
The previous year of the record was in 2015, when the year’s lightning was about 30,000 pieces.
By Wednesday, this year’s flash volume had risen to 18,386.
So there is still a point of interest so that this year does not break the two-year-old record.
However, you can expect a young boy to continue.
According to the latest, Finland will also remain warm and moist during the final week, which is an acceptable birth environment for the worms.
The main emphasis of the Ukkonen will be shifted from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country, there is a more unified rainforest.
According to a guy like that, it's just a few of them.
Coe praises Russia’s “unforgivable” apology from doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world’s general sports boss, praised the apology made by Russia due to doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to stop Russia’s participation ban.
Russia’s general sports leader Dmitri Shljatti said at the IAF Congress held on Thursday in the World Cup on the World Cup, that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he is going to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry, for all the athletes who were taken to the gold or hopsatali competitions.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the general sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA report had provided evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very direct, and it was a very open presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
The Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian League of General Sports had admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities.
Coe said that he was “satisfied,” and that Russia accepted the conditions for the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but Congress supports the recommendation of the working group that now is not the right time to stop the Russian ban,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes compete with a neutral athlete status in London at the World Cup competitions on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many demands before its position can be restored.
“The test is still insufficient and the trainers who have been banned will continue to work freely,” he told reporters on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Tom of Finland was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not come from success as the authors hoped, says Yle.
If it is honestly said, I am disappointed, recognize the film produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorfff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair of 100,000 viewers, which is to the film budget, about EUR 5 million, compared with little.
There is no lottery profit, but now it is important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would already have got their money.
Now you have to wait for a small bite of foreign distributions,\" says Sucksdorfff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions limiting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain from Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive player transfer of all time.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which may prevent the participation of teams in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game financial rules, and according to them, PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
A total of 222 million euros were paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian treaty, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new association is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France is accompanied by a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar’s transfer amount and attaching him to its star card, as it follows that Qatar’s oil-rich monarchy is funded.
The followers will be allowed to use large sums of money to buy players, but they will need to be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not losing.
The financial rules of the fair game were drawn up as President of the UEFA on the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the debt of success was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners had their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair game economic rules moved from the bank’s debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used in Chelsea for the first time in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge amounts of money on player procurement and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of the fair game economic rules will last until 2018. During that period, the followers will be allowed to lose a maximum of EUR 30 million.
Although Platin had to leave UEFA president's duties scandalically in 2015, his successor Alexander Cefer also wants to control the illegal use of the clubs.
“The rules of the game are still in place, and we will also apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, responsible for the economic rules of the fair game in UEFAs, told Associated Press in the last week.
While PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-time fee, it can break the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and the Manchester City to be financed from Abu Dhab.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was also ordered to limit its team of Champions League to 21 players over the period 2014-2015 rather than the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors the clubs that may try to circumvent its economic provisions by increasing their income through companies related to the followers of the association.
If, for example, a qatarian company supports PSG, but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG was overstated.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar’s merits in the PSG could be financed by the payments available from Qatar’s 2021 football World Cup.
However, the PSG and the Advisory Commission have denied that Neymar would be taken from the World Cup Ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to the past sanctions of the PSG, UEFA will follow the rules more closely than usual.
On Thursday, the sources that arrived from the state said that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview with Associated Press, on the condition that their identity is not revealed, because they have no authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, the sales of PSG during the 2015-2016 period was EUR 542.4 million and operating profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts of the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of related products and gaming shirts.
The following estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to make the transfer of Neymar more difficult. It was claimed to break the economic rules of the fair game.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state,” said the Spanish president, Javier Tebas, on the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the qatarian ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal Manageri Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state’s financing of the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports pot.
“The return is a result of the ownership that has changed the football environment in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
Compliance with the economic rules of the fair game will be very difficult. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state.
It is now fast: Finnish MM athlete coach in jum in Helsinki
Long-sleeved Arttu Pajulahti and three-legged Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should be coaching a general sport in the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkela may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the length of the hut and Mäkela on Saturday in the trilogue.
However, the coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa in the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter in the UK embassy without results.
The coach has the invitation of the organisers of the World Cup as a document, but it has not been qualified to obtain a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always dealt with visa issues successfully before, but now there is a problem.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone is looking at the steps of the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible removal of his coach.
MM-Mital for FinlandLontoo requires a miracle
The World Sports Championships start in London today on Friday and last a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
The general sport, mountain skiing and ice hockey are the species for which Finnish poker athletes are passionate about each other, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of pensioners, success is measured in the dimensions.
There are also other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from the values to the other, where the experience of acquiring an athlete is matured to the level that the adult MM medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the Finnish Small World Cup, and there are no captivators.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes off the television screen and glue to follow the races, even though London’s medals are solved due to the time difference only at night.
In 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the cooker Tero Longmäki.
The crowds are waiting for a long scale now, even though the other tells the results of the last days of his or her and other shooters, as well as the survival of the long hill in the last summer’s values.
In these competitions, the long stays in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
To other Finnish athletes, access to the final competition or making your own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal hunt for the coming years of Finnish general sport gives a good success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite force of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from coaching as well as bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope London's races will remain in history due to the race of Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, the fear of terrorism or the attacks of the poor.
First of all, Rukajärvi, second in Copper's Big Air, but it's a shame.
The snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked in the second big air race in Colorado.
Copper Mountain has become the second-highest bike in the world Cup of Rukajärvi.
Women's race won the United States Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi gathered 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the competitions, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and a good file is now, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go right.
I am going to try it again in the competitions, the Dark Rukajärvi.
In the snowboarding big air, the competitor jumps from the jumper for the species.
Viking Line's new fast-start was left to the port in Helsinki
Viking's new high-speed FSTR is very late on schedule.
The long ship was supposed to leave Helsinki at 18:00.
There were eight ships in the ship.
The ship was late in Helsinki.
At least a half hour, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car line moves a little, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, waiting for access to the ship at the port of Helsinki, said at 19:30 a.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical mistake.
Rebane said that the shipping company had brought access to the boats waiting for their cars.
Viking's Communications Manager, Christa Grönlund, tells IS that there was a technical mistake.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a few hours from Tallinn’s return trip.
The ship had to go back to Helsinki from Tallinn at 20.15.
42-metre special transportation disrupts traffic on Thursday night in the Moon
42 metres long special transportation moves from Muko to Mustola port during Thursday night.
There should be nine departures by evening.
The police are driving traffic on the Moon, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the point of the memory, the transport is moving along the 13th route to the port of Mustola.
Wet Hot American Summer and Commade Detective
At the same time, David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing a great series of The State shows for MTVs and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the other stars of the series moved to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory that we have stuck to during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like its time has already lived.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (including the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s vegetable cane talk).
Vitsi’s core is that middle-aged actors are acting with a full-age passion, and its emphasis makes it impossible to reach the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys of the 90s of stalkker movies, such as horror films, the Hand that is hard to cook.
At one point, one of the characters will dig up Apple Powerbook, inline rollerdrivers and change stuff from 1991 to 2000.
Many stories are the same as before.
The heart of Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not been over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in a crazy plot, Ronald Reagan is involved with George H. W. Bush as a criminal partner, Michael Ian Black.
As always in such series, the best are sideways.
It is especially fun to see an iconic Paul Rudd, who has a subsonic under the bow of a party, or Matt Dillon-soul patch, from the movie Singles. The film by Ruddi's acting Andy, the camp's shoes, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may take the flight of this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a friend group goes to Wet Hot American Summer.
On the other hand, the Amazon's Comprade Detective appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series for the spirit of the Cold War, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series's nightmare, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
In the main parts of Gregory and idealist Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici are seen. Their turn is dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (politicians spend time watching TV chess in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Comrade Detective remains too stuck to imitation of the socialist drama – for example, the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not abundant enough.
The series could work better as agitprop-satir, even if Gregor and Iosef repeatedly go to the U.S. embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby with a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The illustrious Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were on a tour of our own near history and their history.
The Kouvalalainen Toni Taurus will rise on Saturday in Macau - against the former UFC fighter
Toni Taurus wants to keep the match up.
Toni Taurus receives a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa, Brazil, was still waiting for an UFC organization last year.
Brazil also has a black belt and a world championship.
I take myself against my parents once.
It's a funny story, says 32-year-old Taurus.
They had to get up last Saturday in Indonesia.
The deal was cancelled because of logistical problems, but three struggles were made on a fast schedule for China’s self-government area in Macau.
Taurus has never encountered anything like that before.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It irritated me because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the waiter is pleased that there was a new time for the fight.
The week’s waiting will not have much impact on preparation.
The transfer doesn't affect the condition because it doesn't work out a week.
The condition can be even worse if you are now practicing too much.
Taurus has faced some of the opponents in his previous struggle, whose strengths are in vertical action.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa a comedian described as a typical brasile.
He's quite aggressive.
I'm guessing he's gonna come up in the first round and try to take him to the carpet.
He's won the World Cup, so he's got the button.
The previous match of the Kouvian did not go according to the plans.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never been so good: he didn't get a hit.
When I left to pour, he hit my eye.
It's been a long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers take it once a year, some get into the circle more densely.
For example, Issa, the opponent, was last seen in September.
He had three matches last year.
Now there is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I've been training in the past few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only been thinking about fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo, and I was happy to do it back.
We got some very good training when we had a friend from Sweden.
The practice was a great help, because on Saturday, a comedian has to prepare for physical struggle.
I've had to train against the same-sized opponents and practice the verticals.
Being able to take a stand is a 32-year-old main act.
You have to hit it rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take it myself.
They must not be given for free because they consume the most.
Macao attracts Taurus previously in China.
I hear it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big evening in front of you.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Central Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been ineffective and inflation has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank shifted interest rates, as the income level of families is increasingly under pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to hold interest rates of between 6 and 2 in 0.25%, with less support in this month, as economic growth has been ineffective.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that the household income level would be increasingly under pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to grow close to three percent in the autumn.
However, the Bank said that interest rates will be needed in the coming years to reduce the inflation that Brexit has accelerated. In addition, the bank announced that the loan costs could need to be increased more than expected in the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented one year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, even though it is expected to provide a cost-effective funding to banks by providing 15 million pounds, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Bank's interest-rate decision states: \"The Commission forecast that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when household real income declines in consumption -
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for a somewhat tightening of monetary policy - more extensive market expectations - to reduce inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in 2018 in the third quarter and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the potential increases would be disproportionate and limited.
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for the next year.
It now held its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
It deteriorated against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound fell by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31 per cent. It fell by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was EUR 1.11 per cent.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after the expected lower growth rates were reduced to expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain in 0.3% in the third quarter, but a little squeeze at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope of accelerating inflation and low wage increases to households, and the Bank said the situation would deteriorate even before it became better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent income loss in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover substantially at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak shortage, which will eliminate part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after the interest rate was reduced to 0.25% after the EU referendum, which fell to the weight reduction.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to appear in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the most recent decision by the central bank, interest rates had started to be more and more pronounced when inflation tightened the pressure on households. Three decision-makers claimed a 0.5% interest rate in July.
In the last month, inflation was reduced to 2.6% of June 2.9% of GDP, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation is again tightened in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the increase in the target level of the two percent was due to a weak proportion.
“As we take into account the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would seem to be increasingly stressful when lenders are looking for customers and wishing to stop the year heavily,” says Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“Markets seem particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are costly alternatives also available.
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
As of September, patients may be prescribed a reverse anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute on the financing of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Before the combination, the drug has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the court’s right to hold the Supreme Court’s last-year judgment, according to which NHS is able to pay the PrEP medicine, although it claims that local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, director of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday as a \"markable new intervention\", and the National AIDS Organization described it as \"a crucial moment\".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive registrations that extend to other clinics in October. Try to reach full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) should be used prior to combination with a HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV monitoring in risk groups.
Before intercourse, the drug means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The medicine can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders and people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose to meet the criteria of the experiment for men, women and transgenders and for those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and reporting to general medicine can also apply for a test in their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the UK NHS signed a contract on medicines after the international invitation to tender this week.
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,” Stevens said.
“This is another important achievement in the ongoing struggle of over 30 years to solve the major health challenge of humanity.
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, president of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is properly targeted for those in need and risk groups, it may have a reversible effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, the risk group will receive NHS-funded drug, which they can independently decide on without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have an effective effect that will improve the lives of a large number of people.
This was welcome news.
“Now it is most important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one of the risk groups remains outside it,” says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP medicine used in the trial has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection in the risk groups.
“The beginning of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that lasted in vain for several months due to government slowing down,” says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
“We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on our work, which we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
Try to help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country. This is how we can protect HIV exposed and make a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been halted.
Quality of living: the middle layer and smart interior solutions have made a small home from Earl's Court apartment
The former banker Joanne Leigh moved Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's time-style house. From Remont's success, it tells us that Joanne hasn't packed and changed.
“Before living with my ex-wife in Knightsbridge, it’s a much larger apartment,” says Joanne.
I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to the apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as in my bridge apartment.
I loved it right away and made the offer on the same day.
After that, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete change in form.
It was a twin, where the bedroom only got out of the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make room height available.
“I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill. Erfan was able to take advantage of the space of almost four meters high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales goal but a home.
The room height was not enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it was possible to stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
The constructions are quite complicated.
The premises had to be doubled so that they didn't have to ride.
The structures had to be adjusted so that the height is just right on and below.
Erfan was able to place two full-fledged rooms on top of the space with its fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the retrouvius copper-strength window opens in the stylish living room.
Hidden furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatre, space, and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor will make the corridor look real longer.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window that opens the view of another room.
The entrance to the mirror-mounted furniture has a storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
More style is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with a bend door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne’s kitchen, it’s a unique fact that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a bit of planning,” Erfan said about the steel-definition cutting-edge MDF door.
“It’s balanced, so it dissolves when you pick it up very easily.
With the design of a sharp space use and storage space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better base solution.
“When selling the property, the area will decide – or the property’s appreciation –” says Erfan.
In the event of a return, the real estate broker walks in to the apartment and calculates the price based on the area of the price.
In Joanne’s apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The adult is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnels in the apartment are partially born on the basis of them,” says Erfan.
“No one climbs into the power lines on the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of good design and add-ons that can make the basic home exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that the apartment no longer wants to be moved away.
The Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer novel
Princess Sofia's apartment was hit.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad the last time she was born.
For the dinner of a Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented her smile at the event.
The Swedish Princess Sofia has visited the Swedish Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented in the A Sustainable Tomorrow Seminar in a beautiful blue body-sleeved outfit that wore a wonderfully pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a darkest settlement.
This is the last mission to represent Sofia before birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish small bag.
Pastellin's dress was great for the princess.
Sofia has been on a mission this week in Båstad Sweden.
Sofia completed her living with a small bag.
Sofia went straight into her summer movie.
Sofia was excited to even talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said I'm laughing and referring to her end-of-life love.
He's raising us with a sweet chill.
In the summer of 1996, Lahti appeared at a home where Thai food was sold.
The Westers didn’t dare to taste, they walked by.
At home, food was sold by Panya Sumsri-Penttilä, among the familiars of Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and the Finns did not know the Thais at that time.
Since the people did not dare to eat, Panja offered free taste.
This is how he taught the Lahtians to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Try the taste, he said.
I fell from the bay to the hook.
I went more and more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, the Panja opened its Thai cuisine in Lahti’s commercial hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 clients.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the boat.
When you are hungry and where you are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
We met better and became friends.
Finally, I sat on a plate with a dictionary to teach Thai.
Two years went to the store hall, but then the restaurant had to be changed, because the spices themselves made are said to get too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
There's room.
Now we jurators are allowed to sit on our own tables again, only in the most busy times we have to ask strangers if there is room next to us.
The bank knows its customers.
They tell him about the names he's been to and who's been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the stages of his life vary and the food mix changes.
He remembers what kind of guy I went to eat my first spring rolls.
He remembers me fat and fat, and remembers what I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than others, sit next to the kitchen door and change the memberships with Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our sense of taste in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's busy.
On top of the restaurant, he goes to the fungus and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was celebrated for two decades.
Our customers got some corn cake for dessert.
Without a alarm or attention, this significant day, at work.
The discovery of land-based support revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to strike in Europe
Security authorities received a significant list of anti-terrorism work from the start of the year.
The list contains more than 170 data from the Isis fighter who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, there are 173 people and the document also includes pictures of each person.
More than 130 people in the list are Iraqi, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been specified.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and photos of a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence authorities estimate the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
It was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes the names and images of all persons, including their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s home country.
The list also lists the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. reads as Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is told that he left Germany in 2012, first traveling to Egypt, then through Libya and later Turkey to join the Isis lines.
His photo is written as a special suicide bomber.
There is no more accurate information about the fate of a man.
A total of 6,000 fighters have left Europe, with no certainty of their fate.
The man went under the surface of Helsinki in Tokoinranran
Based on the interviews of the Rescue Department, the man wanted to show him to swim.
Even a spider can save a dying spirit.
On Thursday, a person under the water was rescued in Tokoinranran in Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, a firefighter at the Helsinki rescue facility, the situation was over quickly.
A person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The Rescue Department received a notification half after four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of the first treatment.
Estlander says it was about 50 years old.
From interviews, the man wanted to show you to swim.
The situation in Tokoinran is over.
Estlander welcomes the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard Agency and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The locals also taught divers excellently.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars hit Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were suffering from milder injuries, the firefighter said.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at three road crossings at four times a day.
Kolari happened when another car turned behind a warning triangle in front of another car, the firefighter said.
According to the rescue facility, the crossing area has an hourly limit of 80 km.
Debts fight over $500 million on real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million. The dispute is related to their Italian family 40 years ago to establish a family business.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses in Torak's value area from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court to dispute the division of property and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company since 2014, but the difference is a bitter dispute.
The brothers and their mothers, Anna, together, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began collecting property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that expanded to 160 business chains.
The trade chain was sold at $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate areas in Brunswick, Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in suburban areas.
According to the agreement with the family’s first father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets, and Paul describes his father as a bearer and a central character.
According to the legal documents, the share ratio of assets means that Colin owns real estates about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
“In my opinion, Colin left the best properties in his proposal for himself,” Paul wrote in his first oath to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court for the first time after several mediation companies.
The brothers are also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from business.
According to Colin, the claim is not correct, and he blames Paul for the poor treatment of some properties.
Colin writes, together with his first narratives, that he would like to reach a solution.
“In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important thing to me,” Colin said in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of statements, emails and reports. The case is being discussed by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian migrants who founded milk bars and delicious shops at the end of the 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a trade in Brunswick.
They were used as a insurance for buying a family from Collingwood, a real estate that Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says she was founded in recent years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi who died in 2012 wanted to transfer properties to their boys in agreement.
“Luigi often said that he did not want brothers to end up in court,” Anna wrote in a statement.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in De Lutis Group business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a series of economic conditions of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is the former member of the Australian League League Board and the best friend of the television star Eddie McGuire, according to the 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he told me in his text that there is no right to comment on it because it is dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me in court and draw our family’s name into a trial,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s requirements.
“Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, and said he hoped that we would be able to reach a solution.
On Friday, the hope seemed to be gone.
“We’re going to settle in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff is going to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss does not get so often into trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with the executive staff on his first working day, he spoke about the key problem he intends to resolve: he intends to limit the access of President Donald Trump to information.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all information – both under pressure and information – must be carried through her, because the President makes better decisions when he receives good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades – and as president, he still looks at a lot of television.
“If President-in-Officer Trump was nervous about the unfair news, he was in favour of the fact that compassionate media were dealing with things more balanced,” said Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor at Trump’s campaign, in February.
According to the former campaign worker, “the administration of Trump’s use of Twitter is essential that his personal media flow belongs to a balanced flow of ringes.”
Okay.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would have ever been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don’t know – perhaps Trump’s tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump left.
If his staff has been able to prevent problems caused by him even a few times, their work has not been futile.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing chaos.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their affairs by giving Trump information that supports their views. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the President with questions.
Supplier Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
“The current and former employees of Trump say that he can be extremely angry with newspaper clips in which he is criticized – especially if he is told about harmful data leaks, and then he has to find out where the data comes from.
It happened at the end of February when someone illustriously gave the President a copy of the news of the GotNews.com website, founded by the online provocator Charles C. Johnson, who was accused of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to anxiety, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started reading the case after asking the staff about Nash.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter had tried to introduce a management system for documents going to Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly will try the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistant still driving his own affairs.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's job very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazil's lawyer Neymar has signed a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday evening, Neymar’s representatives had paid the FC Barcelona 222 million euros for the withdrawal price in the Spanish league.
The Neymar Agreement with Barcelona was therefore broken, and he was free to move to the PSG.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was in Manchester United, which last summer paid EUR 105 million from Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
Former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi, is the chairman of the Society.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer, Raija Oranen, turned on alcoholism and the hypnosis of the flight: “I’m in the condition of my life.
From the TV series, the Rose Time and the Pure White Lactans are known for the success writer Raija Orange just spent 69 years.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren, along with writing, hold their grandmothers, that Raija and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In light and in the sun, out of the old circles Raija took depression and alcoholism from whom he has survived.
The external nature is 20 pounds lighter.
The pressure went down when serotonin medications were stopped, they were mental drugs.
Alcoholism helped me with hypnosis, which also did to fly, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the creative writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orange have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the tourism industry, has been working together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
The queen of such a drama has always been, has stopped her life from that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
A large literary career made by Orane remembers only good 44 parts of the purely white lacquer TV series that touched and moved to Finland.
I finally ended up reading the 50th anniversary of Liisa Seppälä in the clothing industry.
I was the daughter of an ompeler myself, my mother also had a clothing movement, and I sometimes act as a mannequin, orane recalls.
The story changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savilainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Orange lives as a writer for active time, he has many manuscripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
The tourrs returned to the yard of over-millionaires.
The most wealthy houseowners of the West Midlands are once again with the self-adulted circulars who managed to cross the municipal mined door and return to the field next to the houses.
The tourrs stopped their couple of traileres near the street called the millionaires' alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the river of the municipality, and they brought with them the children, horses, and the army of vans.
The tourrs managed to cross the traffic barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Depleted residents have accused Solihull of the absolute inability to solve the problem.
An anonymous resident tells the tourrs of Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown passers on the stone.
“It is necessary to act because it seems impossible to solve the problem.
The tourrs were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They became more and probably even more today.
The resident said that Birmingham’s municipality had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
“Asun Streetsbrook Road, it’s frustrating to pay a municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the tourrs returned so soon after they were driven away.
“They have been more than before, and they have even dropped the horse into the park.
According to the Solihull Municipality reporter, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many local as possible make a notice to the police about disruptive or criminal activities.
This will help to create a comprehensive picture of the situation for the purposes of judicial proceedings.
The people who were killed surrounded by a Portuguese homage machine
In Portugal, men who have been forced to go to the beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died last night as a result of a forced landing.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with the death penalty.
At least 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
A small plane flew by men was forced to make a technical mistake yesterday to the seafront of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran off the landing plane into the water.
The machine hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit a man who was on the plane.
Shortly thereafter, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, said the Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents didn't hurt.
On the beach, the small plane was surrounded by anger immediately after the crash.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, told Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people died.
The two men in the machine were not injured in forced landing.
The Finnish star who had lost his foot tragically won the World Cup again: “I’m not a world champion.
Matti Nagy-Hamar celebrates the early Wednesday morning of Finland’s time at the competition held at the Big White in Canada.
The Grand-Hamar won the cross-country World Cup in the past.
All the MMs have been raised already by three.
Pretty incredible World Cups!
Two times, gold was treated, with a pretty good heart, and the Grand Hamari was happy with the phone.
30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Grand-Hamar, the number of interviewers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumbing has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new calculators.
I always wonder if someone will come after a black horse.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Grand-Hamar lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to stay with his friends since his youth, and the accident did not take him to the slope.
I wonder what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless.
The cards are played, which are shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to make a serious accident and the loss of the limbs a lucky one, and the Great Hamar will not do it.
But he turned to a terrible difficulty.
I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident 23-year-old Grand-Hamar's biggest board was already climbing.
He went to the top after the accident.
I trained with friends and always killed X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that were a little dim over time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere in the X-Games startup.
I couldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and drowned.
I decided to pull the hammers and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The billiard was excited about the choice of Leo-Pekka Star to be a sportsman of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded his prize in the sports gallery held in January.
According to Great Hamar, Star Victory is an important signal for parasports.
It was a big deal, and the profit was definitely earned.
This will also open the eyes of the parasport world.
Since it's time to launch a double World Champion Matti Grand-Hamar Year Sports Campaign?
We'll see it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Not yet, the Great Hamari has conquered all the peaks he wants.
Next year, there is a great goal.
A year later, there will be Paralympics in South Korea.
Let's go get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and Isis leaves the country.
The Voice for Young Sri Lankan Refugeees study explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are baked with bread in refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrians do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of Syria's war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
Trump's administration does not see any change in Syria's conflict.
Burson-Marsteller researched the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study explored the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young people aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were made in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents can think of returning to their country and four percent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people on the return of home affects the most ongoing war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) of the end of the war is considered to be the most influential factor for a permanent return home, while the fourth thought that leaving the country would be the most important thing.
Only less than a tenth will make the most important decision to improve the economic situation or leave Syria in Bashar al-Assad.
Military actions alone do not resolve conflict
The Syrians were asked what is the most important factor in the end of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter keeps Al-Assad's presidency a barrier to the peace agreement.
Almost half of the experience is that political and military solutions are needed to bring an end to the ongoing Syrian conflict.
The only military action to solve the conflict does not believe like a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see Isis’s power weakened over the last year, while the fifth seems to have strengthened its power.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Islam, and in general, it is that the media would provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islamism.
Almost as many were the primary means of military action and education reform.
In the 10th of Fair, the most important thing is to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every four people believe that Syria’s conflict will worsen during Trump’s period.
The views are divided into two aspects of whether Russia and Iran have improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time encoded to keep the Internet in order - for example, the Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo-based company MariaDB develops the fastest growing open source database in the world.
The main product of MaryDB, founded by Michael-Monty, is not paying users anything and can be developed through the Internet by any programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paid customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there,” explains Widenius.
The Widenius, the technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time using codes.
A man with beautiful hands-on distances will help to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database for MySQL, together with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL with a billion dollars, and a year later the software waste Oracle greedy Sun with $7.4 billion.
When Oracle trade took place, a large part of MySQL’s developers said they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, who didn’t give a sure promise about MySQL’s future,” Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life to die.
I hired a couple of best developers from Sun, and I made sure that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
MariaDB’s code of development for the control of the foundation was established.
“No such assurances were made during MySQL,” says Widenius.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion store, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
“Our growth rate has been about 50 percent per year for the last few years,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, President of the Economics of MariaDB.
MariaDB, who focuses on growth, does not yet win, and Paqvalén is obsessive of the company's characteristics.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it, which are ready to pay by business customers.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year’s career if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL’s exchange to MariaDB will succeed in a moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are customers paying by MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer its customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank, Paqvalé’s list.
There are still giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle is also modest to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner said the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB are still ineffective, although fast growing seals.
About $50 billion in the database market, open source databases do not stand up to a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything about these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced with open or at least started.
Big companies do not receive new customers, because most of them choose the open source code next.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped to the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers, Widenius thinks.
Since the exchange of the closed database is scarce, most of the customer companies have engulfed the price increases in listening.
“There are a lot of customers who are really hard to move, because their old apps and others are stuck in the closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer size is coming full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer will move sooner or later into the open source database.
The price is 10-20% earlier, and the service is better, as the customer can easily switch to another database if you want.
Many companies also face major changes in the system as they transfer their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the biggest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now looking to employ more.
One of the reasons for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax resources more efficiently,” Paqvalén says.
Widenius is tired of spending money on closed healthcare systems in Finland when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it is a better way to make the code.
The community helps and does something that cannot be invented or can do.
The 55-year-old Widenius belongs to other Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, alongside the most well-known promoters of the open source code.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on an open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy’s hard-to-be attitude towards civil society rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs who, on their ships, rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to operate unless they commit to complying with new rules on their activities.
“If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate,” Minister Marco Minnitti said in an interview with the Turinn La Steppa newspaper.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German Jugend Retet, whose crew was suspected to cooperate with the human traffickers who promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
“For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to act in the search and rescue area,” the organization announced in its statement in social media.
“We can only evaluate the charges once we have gathered all the necessary information and we can evaluate the situation.
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa platform of the Jugend Retet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees directly from human traffickers who have re-introduced the boats.
One such case is claimed to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, and the information is shown by the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue measures in the area.
According to the guidelines for action, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who controls their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that they would consider new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, because they do not cause any significant changes or obstacles to the salvation of the organization.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct are Nobel-winning doctors without borders.
Minnitti, on the other hand, stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has decreased sharply over the last few weeks, as evidenced by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local mayors will begin to produce results.
“In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He pointed out that the plans will be to continue discussions with the Libyan city leaders on economic development projects and measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his open partner Enontekiö, the suspect found in the ground - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in the Enontekio Cuuts last December.
According to the police, the Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open partner.
Previously, it has been said that both were seasonal workers.
The police also told me that the suspect had fled to the ground with two dogs since his actions.
The man was found cold in the ground, and he did not resist when he was taken.
The case has to be raised in less than a week.
The case may still be located in Lapland’s District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and All-Warden friends, is dead.
British actress Robert Hardy died at 91.
The actor's death announced this family on Thursday.
Founded in 1925, Hardy started her career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the book of James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was shot seven times.
Michelle Carter was convicted of suicide-proclaimed text messages.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered to be an overexpressed boyfriend of Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, completes 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
“My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at the Thursday session.
My son was my best friend.
Carter applied for an amendment to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be dealt with in the freedom of expression.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored buffer, listened to the hands of his judgment in the cross with a crying look on the ground.
“His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor said to the court.
“He decided Conrad’s life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility, the prosecutor continued.
\"He has not shown regret...
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply disappears.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter’s age or maturity and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his work.
The prosecutor read the statement of Conrad's mother Lynn Roy, where she said, \"It won't take a day for me to die my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this. I try to comfort his sister in this pain we will always bear.
Conrad’s sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she was “a good idea,” the idea that she would never see her brother’s wedding and not be an aunt to her children.
“It is painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never be tender,” Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts, according to which suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car to poison in 2014.
The case raised the national attention when it turned out that Carter had been in his text messages to encourage his boyfriend to commit suicide.
“Bring yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways, Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: \"You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start a generator, and you're free and happy.
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention at Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 convicted of murdering his British roommates in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a statement of opinion by Knox, saying: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.
Secretary-General of NATO: Tools for Russia’s worst then Cold War
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could work closely with Russia.
But, in particular, following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the East Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, Nato is still committed to working so hard that tensions don’t get high.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the collapse of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the US and Russia were even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank the poor-minded Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a reaction experienced by car manufacturers
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
BMW’s leader said that “there are more rational options than driving restrictions,” he referred to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines on Tuesday to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a search.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the targets for carbon dioxide emissions.
The nitrogen oxide emissions of diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emissions neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of leaving major car companies and their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed a scam machine in cars that reduced emissions in compliance tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Many of Volkswagen's leaders have been charged with charges in the United States, but leaders' actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director responsible for thermodynamics in the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a trial.
In the past year, Audi was involved in the criminal investigation of Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system of European emissions requirements in its cars, which could be circumvented. The prosecution was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote began with fraudulent investigation, major demonstrations in the permit.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least a million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election results, President Tibisay Lucena said to journalists.
Maduro assures the end of the crisis
On Sunday, Venezuela was elected in a controversial vote to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its own protests in such a way that they would be underway at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces in the country began to take over the parliamentary building of the country on Wednesday.
They are intended to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of the South Rhine Provence region, but it is now at risk of climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to droughts and insects carrying diseases. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Laventel is directly threatened in Provence’s region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. With them, the rainfalls in the spring and especially in the autumn have been markedly reduced,” says Eric Chase, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence.
This reduces the life of the Lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small sauces that spread microbacteria.
The bets are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Instead of small stars and big flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing,” Chase says.
\"In other words, parts containing essential oil are even less...
The solution is applied for by increasing irrigation, slowing the degradation of soil moisture and spraying the plants with a protected clay and water mix. In addition, drought is developed with more durable varieties.
The editor's murder is a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper once a week is usually held on Wednesday to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which one is safer: leave their children home or join them in the delivery of a grenade attack in 2009.
Safety experts have written three words on the front board: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters for names for each group. Evidence is not needed, observations and sensations are sufficient.
The title is written by drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being a government or drug cartels. They are criminals who make Mexico chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. The federal defense has 589 journalists who have been subjected to attacks and threats. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
“The big mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote, together with many of his books dealing with drug violence.
He is deeply digged, although he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture reads: “The right – The thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have dressed in T-shirts, which are decorated with Valdez’s smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a hammer.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Suppliers will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and the fears of their persecution.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office was established in particular for the case of journalists, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, only two charges have been raised so far.
In fact, journalists are rarely in court, as is the case with thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime every year, only few people end up dealing with the right.
Riodoce journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety meeting is only a little useful because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
“This meeting is a waste of time,” he said.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the cause of the event.
Valdez had resigned from Riodoce’s delivery to the state capital in Culiacan this morning on 15 May 2007.
He had only driven a couple of blocks on his red Toyota trip, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposed to be related to the name of the newspaper: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove out of Valdez's car and scratched it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was killed by a wife and two adult children.
The rumors move quickly and charge freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse silence.
Sinalo has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and expelled to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-storey tombs that are larger than many homes.
The state in the coast is “rauma,” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that wars against the boys of Guzman.
The story may have upset the boys of Guzman: the suspects of the gang bought every number of newspapers as soon as the newspaper came to sales points.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same case was subject to an attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroest when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodocen. The stock was sold at the time at $50.
“It was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its things, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
The journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a hard-class research journalism without fear of sensualism, and the readers were fascinated by the stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received an international press release award from the Committee on the Protection of Suppliers, with no sensitivity to the Mexican drug trafficking story.
He admitted openly to fear.
“I want to be able to go on with my life,” he said when he received a commission for the protection of journalists.
“The drug store is in Sinaloa,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompevito TV last October.
“The meter must accept the task he has to do, or be a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me where I was when death was so cold, why didn’t I tell you what was going on?
Riodoce staff needs Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They need a friend who always received hugs and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted her routine.
He always used the hat.
He went to El Guayabo's bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were in his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it if we deal with their women and children in our affairs and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were excluded, Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-esteem and self-defense,
trusting in your instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem with Riodoce’s supplier Andres Villarreal is that “the effect can be disappointed,” and so happened in the case of Javier.
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce’s safety training was held. A few days earlier it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had applied for the shadow of the tree from 40 degrees of heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce’s premises, located in the nelicrary building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some of the reporters were estimated to be half as playing, whether these two police officers belonged to the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not regard as reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited drug gangs by controlling mountainous rural areas.
To this week's number, Riodoce's delivery planned three main things.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s use of money had focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, together with the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, there was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to go carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favor of both drug dealers and authorities.
The supplier found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered with the name of a political party of the ruling institutional revolution (PRI). The PRI has ruled Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in many public cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of El Chapo-Guzman managed to flee and avoid the military race.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez’s column was reliable information about the kidnapping.
“Before we knew what had happened,” says Villarreal, 46 years old, who has received the nickname “El Flaco,” because of his nursing body structure.
“Now all the connections to our data sources are over –
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse that preserves counter-restricted signs and stickers of journalists. The workers of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who have been driving freedom of press.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him when he left the next morning, in front of the local prosecutor's office, for a demonstration, which was once again responsible for the murder of the new reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West of Michigan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, Adame was found.
Suppliers have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In lectures on pedestrians and buildings, there are “SOS Press” texts.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked that he be removed from the affairs of the government because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, criminal law enforcement authorities and an uninterrupted society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control team, more than half of the attacks on reporters last year were on the basis of police and public authorities.
“When people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
The murder has a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border state of Tamaulipas, six years ago.
His body had a message signed by Zetas cartel: “I’m here because of my writings.
His head was cut off by a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some magazines have decided to stop their activities, such as El Norte’s newspaper in the northern Chilean border state after Miroslava Breach’s painting murder.
Some of them continue to work, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez released a message to drug cartels: “What do you want from us?
Some of the suppliers have fled their states or countries.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you must always be on guard.
Sometimes criminals are looking for a reporter in their hands, as apparently visited the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City with four women in 2015 three months after he fled from Vracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to become a poet at the time, admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, the Riodoce journalists sat on Friday at midnight in front of the delivery on the sidewalk when the new number of the magazine had been completed.
In the shooting between the competing gangs and security forces, 19 people were killed in the Maztaltan guarantee.
The war was accelerating, as was promised in the satellite messages found in the area.
Suppliers put the news on Riodoce's website from their foot-walk smartphone.
The home had to be renewed the next day.
Siren are closing in the vicinity – again a new shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the delivery of guarding police officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce’s delivery continued the tradition of the assassinated founder under this massive portrait, where a man looks like a middle finger for the whole Sino.
Bojorquez says he can’t even consider stopping the operation. “How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked us to get to the street on the same day that Javier was murdered?
Hannu Manninen’s Olympic project began with a huge setback – “The hard place –
Hannu Manninen’s 39-year-old party was short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began at a catastrophic rate when Mannine was infected with the flu.
It started a long period of hospitalization that took about five weeks to measure it.
In practice, May went completely ill.
First, there was flu and finally a childhood disease like an ear infection that I had to eat with an antibiotic.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get a good training experience, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapse
The 2007 World Champion was granted a training permit only in the second week of June, which appeared in KIHU’s unruly test at the Competition and Excellence Research Center on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet with a speed of up every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the fingertip of the athlete with the needle.
Last autumn, I spent 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It came against the wall, Manninen says.
Right direction
After the initial problems, Manninen says he's been healthy.
I’ve done a wide variety of calm aerobic exercises that I’ve tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
This is a really good five-week period.
There was also a half-week holiday from the airport.
I also had to go to the cabin with my family.
In the last period, Manninen only participated in four world Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manninen rose to the top 18th.
Guidelines drawn
The main coach of the Manninen and the county team Petter Kukunen has made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different kind of rhythm compared to last year.
After the first race, Ruka would have three World Cups weekend.
In December, at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau, would be involved.
At the end of January, plans would still be included in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be found on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen says.
The Olympics of Pyeongchang would be the sixth Winter Olympics of Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummeline, celebrated at the Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaurs were protected from their enemies by masking
At first it looks scary.
The researchers have now revealed the first research findings of the Canadian miner finding the size of the hornstone, which was so well preserved that experts call it Mona In addition to dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that scientists could even determine that its suction skin was red-brown and had had had a problem with the past.
According to the Current Biology magazine, it has been best preserved for all time by armored dinosaurs and the world’s best species.
The recent fossil found is nodosaurus, which was 110-12 million years ago in the middle of the accession period.
Researchers consider this amazingly well preserved fossils to be a really significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, a armored vegetarian has been the best-preserved fossil for all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to explore his discovery in more detail.
The fossil found in the prison was sent to Tyrrell's royal paleontological museum.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of 1 100 kilos of blocks.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
“If you browse your eyes, you can almost believe that it was asleep,” says Professor Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
“It remains in science’s history as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin studies found that the dinosaurs that eat meat were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and it resembled a walking panzer.
Its red-white panzer masked it from predators, and also protected it from darker and brighter coloring, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend into its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaurus rose to headlines in May, and it is now exhibited in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontolog museum.
Scientists have named it Borealop, according to Mark Mitchell, the Mark Mitchell museum technician, and Mitchell was part of the team that took over 7 000 hours to dig the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been so amazingly well preserved that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body’s veins and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, where the body was darker and brighter.
However, the discovery was a surprise because Borealopa is significantly larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs that eat meat have become so popular that evolution is a means of survival rather than a fight.
Current animals, for example, peuros, seepros and armadillos have a similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The attack of a large, highly panssardised dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodes of the nodosaurus reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists will continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions on its life. They will examine, among other things, the content of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drove to the sea where it drowned on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is really significant, because its suction skin has been preserved and has also been preserved in its original form,” Brown said.
“That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
It does not require much imagination: if you stretch a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.
The season was the era of the teropodies, the vast two-foots, the dinosaurs that eat meat.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, that is, millions of years from Boreelolasta earlier, its great predecessors may have caught this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included, for example, Acrobatosaurus, about 11.5 meters long six-ton monster.
The latest findings of the researchers in Nodosaurus have been published in Current Biology, and they believe that Borealop was screaming at sea after his death and emaminated mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in North Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved pansarized dinosaur with its leather and pansars from the cone to the hips.
The nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two-half-foot-meter-long peaks were raised from their stage.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the seabed.
Its fossilized remains have been so well preserved that its skin remains in the armor's dead plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such retention is “a rare thing like a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still a phossilized leather in its skull wall.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate its foot-based veins.
How does an activist learn to answer the question: who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment in bed playing Facebook with his phone.
Then he noticed the message from his high schoolmate:
“Your husband just killed a young 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street.
When he was disappointed, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had a number of retreadings from @TheePharoah.
The name of the user belongs to the rapper in St. Louis, who tweeted about Michael Brown's death in real time. The White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old Blackman Brown in Ferguson State Missouri.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's inlerant body on the street where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later on the same night, he was told that people would collect the Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police closures and screaming people, as well as Brown's father, who claimed to be their father, who said in the sign, \"Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son.
Ferrell followed a real-time video picture where the police stood in front of the protesters with a dog.
He also said that he saw a video where the other police put their rifles and shouted: “I will kill all of you... animals...
“This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers.
“It wasn’t the murder we’ve already used to and could be said to be typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.
He booked the return home for the next day.
The machine landed at 11 p.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years, the documentary “Whose Streets” was made in the film theaters on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and mental expression, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards the florist of Ferguson and his daughter dressed with the crown, they re-examined the conversation about what it was like to live black and in what conditions they had been talking about countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in? Ferrell remembers his saying to his daughter.
\"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not right.
“I couldn’t leave my daughter with me,” Ferrell told me later.
“The events of this day are the height of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know and to grow up in it.
He has to get the capacity to act and organize, but he also needs to recognize the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living black. And he needs to know what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.
Fortunately, I have been able to protect her from a dirty racism, but she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, and it became a camp of activists waiting for information on the case and finally found out that the police would not be charged.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and shared them with protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to react to activists in a new way.
“My accent was completely changed after August 9th,” he said. When studying at Missouri University in St. Louis Ferrell, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of nurses with minorities, he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
And somehow it just happened.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the assistant director of Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to simply tell you what was going on.
Ferrell’s mind was a bit suspicious. He asked: “Do you really want to tell me what’s going on, or do you want a story that you can use?
In the background of the suspicion, they were countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and toughness.
“We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice,” Folayan said in an interview recently. “We wanted to do things differently.
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Commander Damon Davis, who is known for his activity with the dead prisoners.
Davis's involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, followed by a group of events following Brown's shooting in the years.
“This is not a document someone speaks for us or speaks for us, but we speak for us,” Davis said.
“It was most important for me how local people were presented in the film because I was presented in the same way.
According to Folayan, the purpose was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was intended to show that the movement of people is not a charismatic leader, but a community – Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
This is why the document sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
“I felt pretty naked, Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
“But I realized that this work and the human description of the blacks require a certain vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story once and again brings the role of black women in the wider Black Live Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot the black teenage son of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are linked to the queer identity.
“Mustien queer women’s leadership has kept the whole movement up,” Ferrell says. “It’s because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.
Folayan agrees: “A lot of black women have a lot of queer women.
However, he points out that Ferrell was not selected for the document, as it was, because of its queer identity.
“He got energy,” Folayan said.
“It’s not a coincidence, however, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live in a lot of things at the cutting point, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is transmitted from the White Channel.
New description groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of conditionality left, and he was sentenced to block the highways in protest.
His description of the socio-political climate of his home angle is short and core: \"Sycosotku-
However, he continues to rely on the slogan he learned from the outside of Ferguson’s streets three years ago:
“It is our capacity to fight our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only lose our hands.
The artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung in the middle of the exhibition room face – white, black and brown faces, which can be more closely seen as the one view.
These 30 works are the portraits of the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth prison, where he executed his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic records to the WikiLeaks website.
Dewey-Hagborg The Becoming Reemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a trans-translating and career-wide dissident who was sentenced to prison by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA from algorithms and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, although a little theoretical stance on the modification of DNA data, multifacetedness and the underlying causal relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, his birth name, Bradley Edward, has openly told women of his identity since the break-in. He was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the imprisoned Manning: a wooden, black-and-white selfie, where the underprivileged Manning sits in the car at the driver's place. He has a platinum-sleeved wig in his head, which became his mark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a highly popular Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
There he created portraits based on criminal technical data. He received DNA data, for example, from tobacco pumps and gums, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their stories,” Dewey-Hagborg told the new exhibition.
He couldn't visit Manning, and he couldn't be shot in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned musician came suddenly with letters exchange partners, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even put together a Supressed Images series, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which the president would have alleviated Chelsea's judgment and would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's judgment only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was fortunate to happen after seven years of imprisonment in a nationwide military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump goes to his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers, and finds new ways to strengthen the powerful chasm he had to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that \"all have a purpose...
The gallery wall has an artist’s statement and under it is a great inscription of Manning, where the point of the family’s i is the heart. In his presentation, the artist requires an end to an automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based.
The opposite wall has the Manning DNA cycle: a long line of C, G and A letters with lead.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
“I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretations,” Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also shows his Spurious Memories video in 2007.
“DNA tells countless stories. Here’s 30.
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: the page of the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
“If they get you late, they’ve won,” he says.
“Don’t ever bother.”
“Tekst is the letter I received from Manning, the artist from Philadelphia tells me.
“It’s so impressive that I’m still getting cold colors.
Unlike the cartoon, Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition yet. When Manning arrives, they greeted him with his own genetic data-based faces as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA cycle is written at a lead height, which is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
“The faces were earlier on the wall, but I wanted to bring them to the crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
“I wanted to describe Chelsea’s mass movement, which was also behind his release.
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University employee are being sought for murder as suspects
Police report that they launched a national search to find a professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is suspected of being stabbed to death in a chicagolia luxury home.
The documents of the County of Cook show that the arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local report published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim who had several slices in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident, and the stabilization is being investigated as murder.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Deputy Director for Social Relations at the University, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem is now free of administrative power and is forbidden to access Northwestern campuses.
“This is a crime that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University helps in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement sent by the University and Somerville College e-mail states that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are ready to assist the U.S. investigating authorities in all possible ways.
In addition, the statement said that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
The Chicago police officer Anthony Guglielel said that he strongly urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The parties have an understanding of their location, and we keep looking for our searches,” Gugliem said.
According to Gugliel, local, regional and national authorities help in search of suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrible at the scene.
According to Gugliel, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielel says.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following information to residents: “It would be appropriate to examine the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.
He threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” he told the police.
Moffatt must carry out a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
The 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and to kill all Muslims.
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alarmed them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for the threat.
The threat was not related to the transactions in the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same position as the suspect in the bookstore, the police reporter said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in interviews.
As a penalty, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid social services and pay £620, i.e. around €690 for legal expenses and £85 for compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are left unreported.
“We will bring the WADA’s road map to a final conclusion in the near future – Prime Minister Vitally Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Office’s WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
“On the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which defines the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA’s powers. The second part of the road map was published recently on the organization’s website.
However, it does not involve anything of concern to Russia.
“All has been announced, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, Muko added.
However, one aspect of the map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the alleged proportion of Russian sports in doping.
Mutko said: “The study is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we can't admit something that didn't exist.
Mutko said that the statement by President Vitally Smirnov of the independent Russian anti-doping committee was echoed.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport Sports Media on the same day, admitted that there were problems in Russia’s anti-doping systems. “We have said several times that the report has controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015 after the doping scandal's scope had been revealed.
However, it was authorised in June to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited the head office of RUSADA in Moscow in July. After his visit, he stated that the organization was on the right road – towards the restoration of powers.
British organization as a skeptical for Finnish loved innovation: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packs.
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, who is fighting against the hidden organs, prohibits the use of his own brochures in British maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack would reduce the risk of death.
Weight loss means an inexplicable sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust works as an expert at the UK health authorities on a child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow us to pack our official brochures on them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland is one of the world’s lowest children’s mortality readings, only two dead thousands of births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of a number of different reasons, such as a small number of teenage attacks.
The fact that there is a box for each family may be one of the factors.
However, it cannot be said, Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden mortality.
The maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for a free period of 80 years.
The package includes a variety of items, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, its distributed boxes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says there is no security standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no framework or surface bed available.
The organization recommends that the packaging be used only for day-to-day sleep and stop using it at the time when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of packaging and ensuring that it does not water or dirt.
The wild frog ran away from the Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has been surprised at the speed of the staff and has already been scratched in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa zoo in Okayama, Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told us.
The 35-year-old frog is female, 55-pound, and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the conductor as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the frog will be free to walk in the tarde area.
The zoo hasn't been given eye-to-eye observations from the turtle.
Last week, there was an accident.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid Uber’s mistakes
Amy so far wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online trading startup company, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
“The facts were simply not consistent or objective,” says Madison Reed, a hair care company. The company has 75 employees.
So he decided to go outside for help.
The market has become more and more new start-up companies in the personnel administration that help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can carry out surveys and target them to specific teams and groups of people, and provide anonymous reporting services for their employees and in some cases direct contact with the senior management over the government.
“Our health can be followed by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where you stay with Fitbit, the founder and CEO of the Glint start-startup located in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
This has been using Glint’s software for three years, and he says he’s got a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can draw up a map that can be seen at a glance, with which departments employees are less dissatisfied and which leaders have received the weakest estimates. On this basis, this could have caused the problem to the core.
Companies have realized that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. Around the transport company, the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and punished for problems.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value can rise to over $11.7 billion by 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent is a startup located in Colorado, Denver, which helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate use. The attachment to the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently reached an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to make customized surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and map the problem areas.
In addition, employees may declare inappropriate behaviour by means of an anonymous text message.
And if there is a reason to doubt the manager, the complaints go directly to the company’s government.
“The general opinion has been removed by the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if the company treats its employees poorly or acts as inappropriately, the consequences can be expensive, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose workers and become challenged in law.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 offices. The company has used Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and easily connect to the main office.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that could make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a scary and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, the lawyer of Ruby Tuesday.
Previously, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now, problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated faster.
“I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the worker’s reality,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“In order to protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment relationships,
According to Quinlan, companies started to react more seriously to ethics, values and employee engagement after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of an ethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only with social media, companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public polling of their slippers.
“The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics,” said Quinn.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by capital investors, and Glint and Convercent have the support of capital investors.
Convercent collected $10 million in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised capital for a total of $47 million.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million.
Investment is not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, employees expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market such as Tiilaakso, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they will give their time to a truly useful company.
“Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, manager of the LinkedIn company responsible for employees’ remuneration and well-being.
Investors get returns when companies succeed, businesses succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, information on employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken based on it.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not happen quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to conduct four thousand discussions,” said Russell Raath, Director-General of the Business Management Consulting Company, Kotter International, who has seen companies expect too much to collect information.
“If the company does not take action, the employees begin to wonder if they were heard.
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to Madison Reed, current personnel surveys are taking place every month and are able to address the problem on the same day as announced in Glint.
After receiving feedback from workers frustrated with decision-making and communication quality, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the stability of staff in the long-term industry, which is known for the high degree of change of workers.
“If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of painting his naked female girlfriend, says TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from a shower when she had noticed her window outside her cell phone hanging away from the bitch.
According to a woman, the cell phone camera shot in the apartment.
The woman who was afraid of the case had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that, it was recuperate.
A 20-year-old man who was suspected of being a detective has admitted to a woman who was photographed.
But he said he only described the face of a woman.
The video described on the phone had been deleted, and the police had not been able to restore it as evidence.
In hearings, the man has admitted to the act, but he has refused to commit a crime.
His description of the man was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor as a madman.
According to the news agency TT, a man is charged with the case.
Teachers are asking for more lilac in the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cuts in the public sector’s holidays emphasize the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which there is no way involved in the transactions.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded after private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
For example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets of Luke did not yet reveal.
It is also the Chairman of the Public Educationed Consultation Organisation.
Linked: Vacation cut increases earnings differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of the public sector earners is declining while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday cut will further increase the difference in earnings.
In Finland, how many students per teacher can be
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the best and least successful differences are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are declining, and differences between students and regions continue to grow.
Bruins players’ day was held when the NCAA reduced daily exercises to two
It's about eleven o'clock. A bunch of UCLA American football players left to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs shine on the hair after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this couple of minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training at the University’s summer courses, the students will return to the dorm to read the final exams. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center.
“The three days will come to these friends,” says Jim Mora, a writer of Bruins, a little before the change on Monday.
The University Sports roofing organization reduced the number of daily exercise sessions to two. The aim of the change was to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests are held.
That is why the three first exercises in UCLA began to take place over seven nights, and it was hard for players to find space.
The limitation of exercise times in one day means that there is more exercise days. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six-long Westwood coaching season when the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Exercises are planned to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the season opening match begins: UCLA will meet in September at Texas A&M University.
Mora says she supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made the schedule of players even more stringent.
“We’re going to load them very much for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
“But the players are ready to work, and they are great friends.
I think the situation will be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the training fields in the parking area and the Luskki Center, a flat-rate hotel that has already been bombarded by football on the back of the paint shop.
Bruins players are going to change the hotel for the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available outside.
“We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
“The problem is that people can book the room and describe the exercises there for the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video described in the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and parking area.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom in Rwanda
In Central African Rwanda, the presidential elections are held on Friday, whose winners are already considered clear.
Paul Kagamem officially strives for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country’s leadership since 1994.
At that time, a rebel group of RPFs ended the massacre of extremists.
Kagamem was the RPF commander.
Kagamea has been criticized, among other things, for breaking the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of counterfeiting of poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, Kagamem will be able to work because the two-year constitutions of the Presidency were amended.
However, in Rwanda, Kagamem is also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investments have flown to the country.
In addition, Kagamem has played a major role in combining the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether the liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamem has promised to his people more freedom after the land has been raised to its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against false news by enhancing the verification of facts
Facebook intends to send potential false news more and more to independent facts inspectors and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
On its website, the company published an opinion stating that it will start using updated machine learning in the identification of false news. Possible false news will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being the greatest publisher of liars. Many people believe that liars had an impact on the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded by false news before May’s presidential election and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan to break social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the review of facts is being carried out in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
“People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background data so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share,” said Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook news feed, in the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles function and make other changes to its news feed in order to reduce false news.
The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent's Count is now known as the Squeeze Music Video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming spot in the Bewlin River Valley is a theme for a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned gypsy writer interested in old documents.
“It’s great to be able to study over 300 years ago a text written by a dead person,” Rhodes said.
“I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the edvardian era. Each story has imagined a different artist, promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
“I cried in tears in my letter to the thumbprint, and the letter had written a double agent working for the jacobites in the 17th century,” Rhodes said.
It was his print!
And the letters smelled like smoke because at that time the fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell will make the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives.
The author of the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admitted that he was not able to be in the castle without delay a little longer than he had been expected.
He spent days studying the Victorian-new - castle, archives, treasures and rares, such as the hyenas hung on the wall and the bottles in the wake of centuries.
He walked the old castle with ruins and facilities and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes the book with imaginary artists.
In the evening, he “took whiskey and began to write,”
The closer history of Scotney is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir Elizabeth Hussein in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff was just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held in the same method for hundreds of years: by taking all the extra to the swimming pool.
In the archives there were journals, letters from the time and maps of who owned anything. “It could be imagined that the earthworms are boring,” Rhodes says. “In this time, however, the families fought for even one hard ride.
I was wondering if we could give it to you.
Some of the stories of the book progress from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon relates to the castle after graduation in 1381.
“The Knightly Familyes of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes said.
“The English peasant rebel began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with the riot.
Perhaps these events are connected to each other.
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest, hidden by Darrell family for seven years during the religious cleansing of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He says he staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with stone (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotland. “The men of Perheen seem to have been some kind of freaks, and they were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn’t afford.
Darrell's family's men solved their debt problem by getting married to wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who knew how to ease the inheritance.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life, a paratole of the early 1900s, which has only left a relaxed plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this evil day.
The worst of Russia’s Cold War
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could work closely with Russia.
But, in particular, following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the East Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, Nato is still committed to working so hard that tensions don’t get high.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the collapse of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the US and Russia were even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on the countries to thank the poor-minded Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitzko stop - replaying against Anthony Joshua will not happen
A long-term heavy series of world champion Vladimir Klitskko quit his career.
The Ukrainian Klitzko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klitzko was considered a professional 69 times, winning 64 matches.
He held different MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury found him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitzko met with Wembley's stadium in Anthony Joshua, and then lost the game at a whirlwind in 11th.
Joshua and Klitzko were expected to meet in November in Las Vegas.
Klitzko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitsko told me in his announcement.
As an amateur and professional fighter, I got everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never imagine having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitzko's reasoning on the video.
Klitzkon Manageri Bernd Bönte reported that the termination decision was difficult for Klitzko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitskko has been dating American actor Hayden Pantheier since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitzko's brother Vitali is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles at the same time.
The Finnish weather breaker will pick up the conditions: “Vie from the file”
Minna Nikkanen has been suffering from conditions during the summer outdoor period.
Minna Nikas has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman from the file.
The London World Cup also has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkinen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer’s warhead against Minna Nika.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it wasn’t understandable that I couldn’t even get the little ones to move properly,” Nikkinen said after Innsbruck’s race.
I've competed and practiced here on the way to how many times and I've never experienced one different wind in this place, Nikonen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, the standardization of the jump has been really difficult when the exercises have also been so unstable wind, Nikinen said in Kalev’s competitions.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been challenging to get the technology into a pile of stuff, whether it's a cold drink or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken from the file.
It doesn’t make sense to spend energy in a bad situation.
He got his headway 455 thanks to the World Cup.
It's been 445.
Being in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to have a toast and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don't you change your training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I've got to jump in and standardize technology.
I should have done the same now.
Normally, the rule has been trained, and now the regime has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
A little wind goes as long as it's standard.
Experienced ex-wife bored politicians at the top: “We have nothing to share now and for many years,” he said.
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the Board of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in its hat and beware that the government's budget is exacerbated with debt money, the Ministry of Finance warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared the budget for decades.
He said there was no sharing.
Yle interviewed Virta, who lived in 2015, in the middle of the week.
The next year's budget is just beginning.
Recent proposals by politicians to increase the guarantee pension, to reduce car tax and to support electric bicycles Virtanen will be regarded as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that elections start to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now and for many years.
I even have a fraud to talk about sharing when I owe it, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen pointed out that all debts were owed to children.
Virtäs has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget Department and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Employment and Economic Affairs.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the projected three percent economic growth is likely temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a pitch that will be taken next year to become a minor, and Finland will expect a 1% increase for tens of years.
Washington is changing the rules on permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the Green Card will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal migrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to nationals of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have useful skills in our economy, Trump said according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareta were shot in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and Prince Henry of Denmark, 83, is not buried next to him, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King’s Room has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Rosilde Court of Judgment, the court notes in his announcement on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the prince’s role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his roles and titles in a Danish monarchy, Hovi’s communications chief Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
The decision of the Prince not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated as equal with his spouse.
According to Hovi, the Queen has long been aware of the desire for her spouse to be buried and understand the decision.
The moment on the road: the car was on the highway
Tom had two children and two young children.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive money from insurance if the other party is not targeted.
It happened at Keimolaport in Vantaa.
Archived from the construction site of Kää III.
Vantaalainen Tommi says her family survived on Tuesday with a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, his open-minded wife Riina and the couple's two small children drove on a highway to Keimolaport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinlinna.
The body III joined the Hämeenlinnaväylä, driving an acceleration ride along a white car that was driving a family car to the village, says Tommi.
Without the press, the car would have come on according to Tomm.
I broke up and turned the car at the same time, and it left the hand, Tommi says.
The family car ran into the air at high speed.
The parents and the two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, the other is less than one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed was even driving towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident happened at around 17:00.
According to Tomm, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The ambulance and rescue staff arrived and the family's condition was reviewed.
The car went to the rescue.
Tommi tells him and his small income in the open house, and they got some support for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family doesn't get the money from insurance.
That's why the family is hoping for observations from the viewers of the car, which is why the family drove to the head.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
In his opinion, the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or something knows about it is connected to the police.
The U.S. Police Department and the Central U.S. Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday evening at the scene of an accident.
The title and story was corrected at 21.15 p.m.: Unlike the case originally told, the second car did not come to the front of the opponents, but was driven from the acceleration bar to the side of the family car.
The presentation directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships by means of humor - Self-sacrifier can be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvolaa, brings his premiere guide to what? theater.
The self-sacrificer is a musical theatre presentation about past relationships and inadequacies.
According to Director Lotta Jäppinen, it's still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
The old feelings don't stay in debt, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the tour of the summer theater performance has been carried out with a long-rural budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the show is asking you to consider what a person reveals when you get to know a new person.
Maybe he's taking a role or is he approaching another jacket open?
A drinkless presentation confuses the fact and fiction
The latter has both directed and dramatized the presentation.
He also responds to the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation is about the thinking of young people, it speaks of all kinds of things.
The latter emphasizes that the self-sacrifier does not directly tell about his or her own relationships or the relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own values will care about the show.
I don’t think relationships would be bad, but I don’t think that relationships, especially relationships, would be a condition of happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
The latter believes that the self-sacrificer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He said that many people have learned a lot about relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.

Love of the Theatre Fired in Kouvola
Lotta Joppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is a director of the theatre free-of-the-art theatre at the University of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's been two years, and there's another mess.
The enthusiasm for the theater has begun over the years of Kouvola.
The teacher of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and played in Helsinki for example and the last time in the City Theatre in Turku.
Control has started to be more and more interesting.
The self-proclaimer received his first night in Helsinki last week at Narr's show.
For about 45 minutes, the presentation was also seen in the future, at least in the study town of Jäppinen in Turku.

The Finnish Olympic winner recovered from the terrible Motocrossonnetto - the necklace broke
Few athletes in Finland are similar to the uninterrupted natural power of Janne Laletta.
At the Kumparevosä, the world circulated for hundreds of days a year for a couple of years, hunting its dream of the Olympic Gold.
The dream took place in 2002, but Lahtila's movement continued.
He was not only a tired trainer, but also an experiment of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired you to practice.
There's always something new, Laletta says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Latela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was injured in a motorcross accident.
As a result, his neck and both his hands broke.
I wasn't at work.
I've been licking wounds in my home for a year, says Lahtila.
There was bad luck in the box.
He also admits that the age might have been a part of the trouble.
Driving a girl can sound great.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just as a species so hard that you don't want to do too much of this 40-year-old thing!
After the accident, Lahtia was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
It was a long runback as the main coach for the Japanese freestyle country team.
He started in the nest immediately after his career ended in 2006.
The first time I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, she says.
At the time of training, Lahtela often challenged her protective clothing in the slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts were not reasonable either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it because I was only able to be once.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtia as the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd been burned.
It’s easier to find places that have gone away than the jewelry!
Without an accident, I didn't realize I needed so much rest.
He started the Finnish freestyle team as a coach about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of the speed species.
I changed the motocrosses to the frisbeegolph!
He left the flat right away.
At the worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Laletta has always been a superintendent trainer, he does not require his coaching to be the same as he does.
I don't force everyone in the same fashion.
In our culture, there is room to be their own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, says Latela.
Sex robots come and we have to worry about
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just when it began to feel that 2017 can no longer become more strange.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
“We must begin to take seriously the generalization of sex robots,” says Professor Noel Sharpey Sheffield, founder of the Foundation and Emerior of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingertips.
“We’re looking at the slexirobots, but they’re already selling quite a lot, and we’re going to see them even more,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Sexholes have developed from breathtaking dolls to robots with a warm-looking silicone icon and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble the use of man.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingertips.
It is also more worrying that robots have “personality,” which makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexholes have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the nature of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even as shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigit Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is an adventure and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is adapted as fully as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same thing as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It may be tired, chat or wind.
There are many worrying features in the generalization of sex robots. They replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous are women's underselling and direct rape fantasies when users approach, for example, a programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
“Women have a vibrator. Why men shouldn’t have a sex robot?
Sex robots are not just fetish or new sex toys.
Their generalization and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subordination is one alternative among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become widespread at the same time as women’s rights are threatened around the world and the White House is sitting in a president who has been blackmailing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Orjattares) is not the most concerned of its powerful image language, for example, pictures of the hanged body and out of the digested eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are tried to do as much as possible with real women (the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements mimic as well human movements as possible.
Their personalities, however, are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or situation.
They do not have their own will or history – nothing that is relevant to independence or that violates the fantasy of complete surrender.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were designed in Australia, the team led by Chief Isis.
The chief of the Äri organisation Isis led a group of Australian men who were suspected of planning to take a bomb to the Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person who was in charge of his father’s leadership had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspects, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company stopped before the security check.
The police don't tell us why the company broke up.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas-extinguishing device and take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport tool.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police patrols on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
Trump's good side?
Get Mitt Romney to show a healthy sense of perseverance
The Trump period has already been repeated until the end of the day, that the powerful chauffeur of voters has also broken families at the level of the everyday level.
On the Christmas and Thanksgiving routes, the American newspaper’s advisory boards were guided by how Trump and the voters who voted.
We all want to get some information.
Less attention has been given to Trump’s ability to combine families.
I'm gonna tell you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet who's been in Chicago for a long time with the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy could have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins are familiar – including Republicans - a sister with whom he has been arguing for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more widely considered it involves significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we are talking about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to do his tricks.
In the long term, there is even a more terrible possibility that Trump will normalize the real extreme Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I would like to remind Mitt Romney of the slow version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and at least his tax returns) and compared to Trump, they seem very mild in violation.
When Trump’s season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be only clear, and it immediately seems to be a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to Central Park's carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park department, and the best thing that New York will get for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of Karusell are huge, middle characters – loose clowns and animals looking back in the terror – they are malicious, and the underlying music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s characteristics are becoming disappointed over time: the views of high buildings begin to get bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality does not correspond to dreams.
Not yet, after 35 years, it has come to the fullest of the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a great driving circle in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-citizen pub, but it is not counted.
The carousel of Central Park is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two-four-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the furry a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week, I was asked to evaluate my payment experience – at a scale of one of five stars before I put my credit card on a reading device.
The same thing in the café at my home, but there's also an opportunity for me to combine 15% of the service money when I go to the coffee box myself.
This slows everyday interaction and pressures the customer server to put their person into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The dealer of the square smiled sorry when I was tired of giving my credit card five stars to my experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from Interi - \"There was no leadership confidence--
Today, FC Inter has released the mission of the Hefki Kuq Society’s Mission Team coach.
The coaching responsibility will be taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who has previously served as an assistant coach.
Other training groups will continue their current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in the English Sunderland.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter Coaching Group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
President Stefan Håkans, President of FC Inter's Board of Directors, is sorry to have happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq had no more confidence in the management of the club, when there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the board's press release.
The Piccarireta agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are already responsible for the home match against the HIFK tomorrow.
According to the news from the evenings, the team has crashed along Thursdays.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that the club’s assistants Piccareta and John Allen were moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a lot of time in an Inter match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released a youth picture from the 80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
In Instagram, Viulutaituri Linda Lampenius published a youth picture.
A number of puzzles have been added to the picture, making it possible to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius also wonders about a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, serious, he communicates.
If the picture doesn't show, you can see it from here.
Lampenius has previously published images of his past and also spoke about painful subjects.
A year ago, he published a couple of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, and in the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his image, Lampenius is considering his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders he suffered younger.
It was 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to the English hashtags of life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his past years of eating.
He was at the hospital when he was 14 years old because of anorexia and Ortorex.
A little later, he also got sick of his bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
The healing began with a little noise.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped with new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for the slices on his wrists, according to the prison authorities, after he fell in the cell.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder by the accused of the original killing sentence.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they are going to complain again because they think the six-year sentence of Pistorius is too mild.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If the complaint is accepted, the sentence of the Pistorius may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country’s foreign ministry’s BTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that they later released Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and already give noticeable fines to anyone who is camping in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The minister announced that the right may be fined.
Neste’s share sinks - has already been -7,7%
Oil refiner Neste’s share has increased by 7.7 per cent about 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has left today on the packaging side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening up of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index was reduced by 0.2 per cent.
The total index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had decreased by 0.3 per cent to 959.48 points after a half-hour trade, and the OMXH25 had increased by 0.3 per cent.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritant bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
A recent study, however, argues the opposite: a diet containing a lot of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate an irritable bowel syndrome.
An increased intestinal syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 30,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers of the Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the tolerance of the intestine.
According to the study director Marco Colossa, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that the harmful microbes in the food do not get into the body.
Inflammable cells balance cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too close to inflammation, the result may be an irritant bowel syndrome.
In the experiments, it was found that the immune cells that are resistant to intolerance are in mice with a specific bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria need tryptophan to start the immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building materials of proteins.
“We found a connection between the Lactobacillus reuter and the development of cells that promote tolerance. The Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbim of the intestine,” says Professor Colonna.
The more the mice diet had tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells.
If the same thing works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a high typtophan-containing diet may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation.
When examining the immune cells that strengthen the tolerance, Professor Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that, although one mouse group had such cells, they were not in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomas of mice, i.e. the gastrointestinal community of normal bacteria, fungi and viruses.
Six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were administered to mice growing in a sterile environment without intestinal microbim and who did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – to the immune cells that were isolated from mice.
Immunous cells developed to be resistant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indoli-3-mitoic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the treatment of mice, the number of cells that confirm the tolerance increased by about 50 %. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same anti-stolerant cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether other products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuter bacteria are able to develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, gene errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with acute bowel syndrome.
“We would probably like to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate inflammation in the inner areas of the intestine,” says Cervantes-Barraga.
The high levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalization.
Jose Mourinho said Manchester United had a contract with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United was awarded a contract with Nemanja Matic. The midfield player debuted in Manchester United's matches against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Mact, who moved from Chelsea to 40 million pounds, started a two-time win in Dublin, in the last round of the United, before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression against the stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Mact was not in the best condition yet, because he was not involved in the blue shirts on the Asian tour before the start of the season. He was only on the field for 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, there is a change before the start of the elective period.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and way of thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football mindset,” Mourinho says.
“We will help him to be ready sooner than later.
In addition to Matic, the arrivals Victor Lindelof and Romel Lukaku were starting a game with Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to slice its initial composition for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more players, even though the company had already done a great job – by acquiring three of his four priority players.
“Three out of four,” he added.
“I’m more happy to have all four, but they did a great job.
Air balloons have been bullying Germany for two batches
The Finnish Women's Balloon team lost its fourth World Cup tournament to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German routine in playing is high.
Their game was in every sector, the Finnish chief coach Tapio Kangasniemi told us in the press.
In the first two paragraphs, Finland kept its opponent in a hole, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to play with it, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective collection of 14 points was Piia Korhonen.
Three of the four games have been lost in Finland on Sunday.
Reuters: A large jury has already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr's Russian meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to meet Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury, called by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer known for the Kremlin connections with Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The news agency Reuters, which, at the same time, confirms Wall Street Journal’s request to gather a large jury of information previously revealed on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges related to the meeting of Trump Jr and the Kremlin known as Veselnitskaya, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, the current advisor to the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has summoned a large jury in Washington means a consolidation of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to assist the great jury in his investigation to investigate Russia’s involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump’s campaign or his immediate circle cooperated with Russia.
The great jury extends Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, to send challenges and force people to testify with authority.
A large group of common people are working behind closed doors.
A large jury weighs on the evidence that the prosecutor investigates and decides whether the case should be brought up.
British inventor microchips himself in order to get home and in his car with a tear of his hand
The British inventor has been the first in the whole country to microcirculate himself so that he can open his home on the outside door, get into his office and start his car with a tear of his hand.
The microchip is 33-year-old between Steven Northam's thumb and front finger. Now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq company technology.
Northam co-operates with Geoff Watson, a physician consulting the Royal Hampshire Count in Winchester to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and the installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also transforms the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has placed microchip technology in both his home and BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
Your White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House was to pay the taxpayers $24,000. The information appears from the military documents received by the TIME magazine.
Green White Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on its way. It was a attraction in the event held at the White House on 17 July 2017, where American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials took a look at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter prepared in Connecticut, the samples included sailing boat from Maine, fire truck from Wisconsin and truck from Mississip.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter to be placed on a specific order only about 36 hours before its landing to the southern lawn, an exceptional event. This is evident from the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the Navy.
“I just wanted to make sure that you’re aware of this because it’s an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail to his boss, an assistant commander of the Marine Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17.7.7 p.m. in the morning and the event would begin in three afternoons. The helicopter would leave the place only after the lawn field would be cleared between six and nine in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House would be delayed, another crew would be required due to the limitations of the service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the time of the event, and the security staff of the unit was at the helicopter when it was in the country.
The documents received by the TIME magazine do not determine whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked, breaking the law of the event.
“One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was broken, and we were told not to break,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But the official events also have political tone.
At that time, the President spoke for a health reform at the time of the Senate and for a smoother state regulation.
The use of Marine One Helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their trips,
But their use is unusual only for photos.
Trump's actions raised attention in February when Air Force One ran the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
“The White House is very satisfied with the Made in America event, which presented American workers’ products made of American materials from all 50 states,” said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The crews of the HMX-1 unit regularly carry out training flights in the Washington area and train the President on the southern lawn with the accuracy of the centimetres in the White House.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 exercises for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly training quota for the crew.
On that day, helicopters of the unit also had 11 hours for non-presidential support tasks.
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s informant said the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have an accounting record of flights related to the duties of the President, and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence 2017 hourly compensation for VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 unit documents, flights from the state of Virginia to the White House in Quantico and returned to a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating a helicopter is clearly lower.
“The calculation of the costs incurred by taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters said.
‘The required level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called 'accumulated costs', which are taken into account in annual appropriations.
According to the report by the RAND Research Company in 2015, the level of compensation does not include personnel costs, but takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended helicopter use in the event.
“The idea is to present American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is absolutely appropriate to bring it up.
It's not sure if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he was sitting in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky camp.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. “I have three of them.
The lightning hit the Vaasa Rada - trains must be replaced with buses
The passenger train traffic between the wall and Vaasa is different due to the technical fault, the Railway Traffic Centre informs.
Trains are now replaced by buses.
The failure of the traffic control system caused the failure.
In the morning, the railway station did not have an estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuelan state prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new country's representative.
The state prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has announced that last Sunday’s vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative was elected to the country, which, among other things, could change the constitution of the country.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent is requested because of electoral polls.
Ortega has also started a polling poll.
He appointed two judges for the task after the British company who held a representative vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million higher than the number of actual voters.
There were only the Allies of Maduro, and the chosen 545 members include Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representative may break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitution to be the way Maduro strengthens its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, the UK, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise a new representative.
Maduro claims that the new representative group is a solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
The rest of Venezuela has continued for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela suffered from the economic crisis after the fall of the price of oil.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show its opinion on Friday, when the new representative will be expected to begin.
The Russian man who gave up Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis Court of Justice in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Maxim Senah to four years of imprisonment from a worldwide computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US requirement.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland gave Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, says AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of a computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was imprisoned for 46 months.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after the sentence of imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs deeply blamed Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which was infected with tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish users and passwords.
After that, they used the data by continuing to direct Internet traffic, which was used to conduct click-offs and spread spam.
According to Director Kenneth Blanco of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.

Narcos's third production cycle trailer: Pablo Escobbar is away from the patterns, so Cali's cartel rises to the main part in Netflix's ski series
Although Pablo Escobari's killer was discovered during the second production period of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The direct reception service has already confirmed that the series is seen in the third and fourth season of production. The trailer of the third season has been published and presents the new frogs of the series.
During the third production period, the DEA, the U.S. drug police, has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trading organization.
The four rubber-led organization operates as much as Fortune 500 companies, except that there is a little more corruption and violence among the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) has its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) works in New York.
In a recently published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian policemen in the war against drugs.
The new faces are Matas Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola implements an extraordinary work of light art in Paris
Joensulainen Light Artist Kari Kola (in the form) performs an extraordinary work of light art in honor of the first Light Day set by the United Nations in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola works in Paris for a photo art book called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - the day and night - the sun and the moon.
In the work, the UNESCO headquarters is illuminated by Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I also want to emphasize the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise the important things of my chemistry to be concretely visible, says the photographer Kari Kola in his work.
I have been well taken from the invitation to be involved in the first international light day and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Valo Year in 2015, when he would celebrate the celebration day in honor of the UNESCO Headquarters.
I feel very privileged to get my art back to the UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may continue to expand significantly.
We will inform you about this later in the coming autumn, Kola will continue.
The goal of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to increase people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought at the shopping center in Espoo
Two men were born into a dispute in Espoo in the shopping center at the Iso’s Omena parking facility on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally went to a forbidden direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
The driver in the forbidden direction of driving would scream the driver of the other car, resulting in the car moving into the car of the batter.
After that, he hit another car in the machine game.
In the preliminary speech, the man has admitted that he has caused the damage and has done wrong.
Timo Soin’s article titled: “After that, the flood came.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday, titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven political parties.
After that, the flooding came, now all the floats, Soini writes.
The Soin text has references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the waterfall version.
Depending on the interpretation of the history books, the floodings of the water after us have been left.
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are representative only if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the Director of the United Nations Embassy in Afghanistan Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Director of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women, three women are seeking to become Vice President and more than 30% of recently registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be stressed too much,” Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghanistan Council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
Taliban has made threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving towards a consultative role.
The elections of this year are the first time the power to move peacefully from a democratic elected government to another one.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the independent electoral committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

In the metropolitan area, the weather is rainy and rather windy.
In the afternoon, the cloud cover is scratched and can develop worms.
The night is clearer and clearer.
There are plenty of rains in the southern and middle parts of the country, and there can also be a hole in the south.
In the south of the evening, there is a lunchy and clearer, a rainfall can still come.
The evening temperature in the rain is about fifteen degrees, with a more uniform rain on the south coast near twenty degrees.
In the north, the cloud varies and becomes local afternoon resorts.
During Friday and Saturday, the matalaine dominates the weather space in the southern and middle parts of the country, and the rains are common.
In the north, the rains remain low.
Saturday, in the southern and middle parts of the country rains in many places, including the hole.
The rain also extends to the part of Kainuta.
In the north, the cloud is large in the afternoon and becomes individual rains.
In the southern coast of the wind from lunch, in the middle and north of the country, air flow is eastern.
On the north side of the British Isles, there is a powerful lowland, with the associated sails bringing plenty of rains to the southern part of Fennoscand.

The flood of certain tourists is a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly targeted at cruise ships in the form of tourism.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it \"hot and free\" tourism: there are only a few hours to go through the sights of the great crowds.
Venetian is a threat to tourists who travel to the city for a quick day trip.
On the streets it is difficult to move and the fine doors are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice are no longer fit.
They have been forced to move further from the historical center, while hotels have become available for the replacement of their homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian wrote about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a poor tourist - low-quality tourist.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the guide to Piazzale Romalta Rialton Bridge and the St. Markus Tower, and you turn back, describes the tourism that is taking place by Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the city's identity.
The St. Mark’s Tower is also part of the most popular places of visit to Venice’s historic centre.
The Church of Saint Mark is located on the side of the tower.
Local anger is also mainly targeted at cruise ships.
At the historic center of Venice, 50,000 people live.
In 1951, the population was about 175 000.
In July, it was estimated that 2 000 Venetians were against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income it needs and create the need for a number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been designed to allow cruisers to go beyond the historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change if the Veneto administrative area, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on its own things - unless complete autonomy is met.
There are about 20-30 million tourists visiting Venice every year.
Are you heading towards Kuopio?
High-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed, low-speed
On the road between Kuopio and Siiljärvi, the lane on the north has been a million miles from the work of Thursday afternoon to the time of return traffic.
In the area, we work on the stretching of motorways, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
In the case of road works, there is a 50-mile hour speed limit instead of the normal 120 km hour speed.
However, in the 50-kilometre restricted area, traffic had been moving in practice on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday night, the roads went on the side of the Lake Siilin in the case of the Revelation statue, or the golden curry.
I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of the public.
Amalie Iuel has released wonderful pictures of herself in Grand Canyon.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen into a popular athlete in Norway in his current country, not least because in March he broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run by orbiting the wheel cycle at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-meter adjux at the time of Norway’s record of 55.38.
The Iuel, who used a very social media, soon became aware that fame and publicism had a shadow.
The men around the world began to send Iuel pictures of their genitals, apparently, in the hope that young runners would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close off his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of “breaking photos” from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what pictures he received.
You can guess, Iuel.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, her father is Danish Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved first to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were on their way.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three trainers, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than the United States.
Coaches in the United States don’t ask anything but give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record at 400 metres and 400 metres in the garden train.
The footman Janne Korven took the whole career to the stake - now he's involved in the World Cup: \"A lot when he doesn't hurt anything.
It's been nice to count when nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, who reads Finland’s most successful snowboarders, 31, has been able to enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the career continued to be at stake.
The weight loss of the table had forced Korve to cut the table in January, and the foot did not want to heal.
The hand also took a hit on the track.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was gonna do, whether I was going to go on board or not.
The sponsors were broken and many things open, Korpi says.
But that’s what they say that things are going to be okay.
The foot improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back to the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, \"Oh, shit, yes, this is so fun, let's pull through a couple more.\"
The cart was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long period of counting, only painless training has been a big deal.
There are only a few people around the hall.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding.
I've never fallen for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think that way, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi races in the middle of the Spanish World Championships in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races don’t like him on board, in a hard association, he’s always on fire.
According to the cart, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Association has increased over the past few years, although some of the planners chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
These are important races, the visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-year team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's bumps, the 17-year-old Rene Rinne Fabric and Emmi Parkkissenniemi, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow the way younger friends go.
I remember when it was at that time that everything was new and was so sick about everything.
It brings a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the line, but otherwise I don't have that much power in my friends!
In the background of a boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sport career.
Pekka Korven’s son has been involved in medical sports: the director has his own health care horses for whom he does training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But I watch at least the results every day and usually something from the beginning, Korpi says.
Treatment management and treatment training are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the ferrying career is completed.
I don’t want to plan that far, but it’s at least a likely option.
I'm going to experience it just as much as I'm learning it in addition to snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep my time nervous and develop, and in the summer maybe drive something out of the way.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to start when it’s already done inside the species.
The treatment is also part of the Elitloppet treatment course with Jaajo Linnoma.
The twin has rented a cruise ship that is heading to the Stockholm Elitloppet restaurant at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
Riding has gone very well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, it is hoped that the ship will be filled,” Korpi says.
Attendon's nursing home project for Kite has surprised all
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new, 41-season nursing home for Kite.
The building of a large 1,700 floor-earth building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighboring health roads.
The subject of general wonders is where customers are enough for the new treatment unit, because now during the wars of Siu many private nursing homes are taking the customer shortage.
Anne Flink Attendo, Director General for Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the choice of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kite in Kanervikkola and Eerika last year.
The trade concerned business, but there is a five-year lease agreement on real estate.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to remove operations from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union applies from the leaders of McVitie's chain manufacturer to strengthen its long-term commitment to production at Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Department of the UK General Trade Union, the company has not told us about its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea have more than 500 employees in the manufacturing factory.
The company owned by McVitie's brand, Pladis, said he invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will certainly be the first to meet if there are any changes to the business.
In a letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company to respond to the concern that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines.
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, is very concerned that the factory manager will not be able to obtain clear information about the business needs of Tollcross and future investment plans.
“Perheet has worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly focused on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow. Tehtas is a significant employer in the area of high unemployment and poor living.
From the point of view of increasing cost of living and production, jobs, wages and income and Brexit, the Eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production.
According to Pladis, the factory manager received a letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company is directly responsible for the letter because it values continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees, among other very competitive and uncertain companies in the market, so that we will constantly assess all of our business operations and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the reporter, the company has invested over £5 million in Tollcross’s factory in recent years, particularly in its production lines and in the improvement of its operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production facility and are sure to tell the first employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to the operation of the plant.
Did PSG warn Barcelona of the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's target after the end of the $ 189 million transfer agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most spoken summer case. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of migrants. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG will offer him more than £500,000 a week’s wages after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry about the activities of PSG and the way Neymar has left the club. The source near Barcelona tells us that Neymar has been very well cared for since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they bother our players, we’ll be their opponents and we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We honor all the clubs.
But if they bother our players, they will have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of just this: it expressed its interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verrata earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italians to leave under any circumstances. It can well be that Barcelona loses its star player Neymar.

NYT: Trump's glowed calls were invented - the White House reporter: \"I wouldn't say it was a lie.
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, says New York Times.
Trump's smoked calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the party organization have proven to be invented.
The White House reporter Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many political leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump, president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, spoke to Trump at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
These discussions happened, not just on the phone, but on the face of Sanders.
The speech to the party awakens evil
Trump told the Mexican president on Monday to call him and thanked Trump for his successful illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will come across the southern border of Mexico, because they know the trip is going to go to the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a statement saying that this call had not happened.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump said his speech at a large meeting of the national patrol organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the patrols, he said it was the most wonderful speech that has ever been held to them.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the group announced that it was not aware of the call made by any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the statement, the previous statement by the director of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had asked Trump to apologize for the speech from the political parties, speaks on his side.
Trump’s speech at the meeting of the party organization raised a lot of strangeness, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He made the results of the last autumn presidential election.
