Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have become confused with the recommendation to turn their title into MWP (member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Wales Parliament).
The topic has started with a plan to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Parliament of Wales.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly of the Laborists said that his groupmates are concerned because it is grumbled with the words \"Twp and Pwp\".
To explain to readers outside Wales, the word daft means naps, and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the Board said that the whole group was not happy and has offered other names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his group treats the change of name “responsibly,” but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to “Muppet”.
To be clear, the volume of the letter w is similar to that of the English language of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drawing up a draft law on the amendment of the name, said: “The general decision on all the names of the National Assembly members is made by the members themselves.
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public poll on the proposals concerning the name, on the basis of which the ideas are widely supported to be renamed the National Assembly as the Parliament of Wales.
In relation to the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name \"Wales Parliamentary Members, WMPs,\" but in the public poll participants supported the most popular option \"MWP\".
Members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should submit a bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform act also includes other amendments to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of the members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly remains in the discussion of the legislation to the members themselves.
Macedonians hold a referendum on amending the name of the country
On Sunday, voters vote whether to call their country “The Republic of South Macedonia”
The referendum will be held with the aim of resolving decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province in Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its name represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of EU and NATO as a member of the EU.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, those who voted for the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the name change is only a price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's watches are silent because the Churches of Harlem are in trouble.
“The more people I’ve talked to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
\"There is no one more--
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhood, where people stay every day.”
As for the churches, however, he is concerned that the money he receives from the sale of assets does not continue as long as the leaders are hoping, and “more or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment houses, whose apartments are full of people who do not pass the hand of the remaining pilgrimages in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore accelerates the arrival of this day when all these churches close their doors, because it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of these churches.
Both churches built white churches before Harlem was built in 1870 by the Black Metropolitan Community, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, who had worshiped God so far, took over the property right of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was occupied by African-Americans in the forefront of reverence with John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th- Street shoppers in Harlem, if they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the Father Johnson congregation planned to restore the building, they introduced a carilion, or a watch game.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's Church, David Johnson, called the Lambion with pride, \"for the watch of the poor people.\"
However, an expert who played the faculty called another: \"cultural value and \"inevitable historical tool\".
From the University of Tiffany Ng Michigan, the expert also noted that it was the world’s first carilion played by a black musician, Diosio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger carilion in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, the Church of St. Martin has played a series of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved with the secular leaders of the church, other bishops.
In July, the head body of the congregation, composed of secular leaders, complained to the bishop, in writing, that the bishop “will seek to pass the costs, even though the position was not even related to the salary of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the acts of the bishop.
In California, the shark was injured by a boy diving for 13-year-old lobsters.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived to California for the lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy's help and then swim in the place with others to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially believed that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the homber, but “he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I was bitten.
His entire rank was bare,” Hammel described the picture of what he saw when he reached the boy.
“I told everyone that they would come out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
In a life-threatening position, the boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The shark species has not yet been known.
At the press conference, Vettel rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but then it was established that this was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablanca to Swaziland.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered hazardous.
Saisbury plans to take power on the UK beauty market
Saisbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-like beauty products that also work with expert advisors.
As part of an important invasion of the United Kingdom’s $2.7 billion beauty market, which, as the sales of fashion and home goods continue to increase, the wider loopholes of beauty products are tested in 11 stores across the country, taking them into use in other shops next year in case of success.
The beauty products are invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the previously separated shelf space for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Saisbury said that it plans to double the choice of its beauty products to up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The available range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in brands such as currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its series of makeup products Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding more and more.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will be opened in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
Online shopping and transition to daily shopping of small food supplies from local food stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Saisbury, has said that sales sites are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight cheap chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
In Saintsbury, Argos has placed sales locations in hundreds of shops. The same has been done with Habitatis sales sites, as Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier attempt of the Supermarket to update its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Saisbury attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a row on how to share the revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold his 281 son drug business for 125 million pounds for Celesio, which belongs to the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trade chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding its four shops to the range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business leader of Saisbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on special training for employees who are always willing to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need. The attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trading, which can change old shopping methods.
Peter Jones is maruvihane because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of a deal.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left the “morning” when TV director Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of a transaction in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has enough time for the brand Truly.
A couple of businesses are compared to Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
The leader of the 37-year-old TV show “This Morning” announced in Instagram his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star to get in touch with Peter Jones' anger by steping out of their luxury lifestyle brand activity in the last minute to focus on new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The aliens said that Jones was “marivihane,” when the star girl on television recognized at a stressful meeting that took place in Marlows Buckinghamshire, the headquarters of the man’s business empire on Tuesday, that her new contracts in the value of 1.5 million pounds mean that she no longer has enough time to devote herself to the brand of houseowners and clothing.
The business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated 11 million pounds of property.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK in one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure her far-reaching future, so she thought she would do it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in connection with the matter was a complete surprise.
No one could believe it was happening on Tuesday because it was so close to placing a series of products on the market.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sales.
Experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid celebrities in the UK can be paid millions to the company, because the choice of products ranging from sofa batteries and candles to clothing and domestic clothes has been invested in a captivated amount of money. It can also lead to the later placing of the product on the market.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. The 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go together on vacation trips and Jones has a 40% stake in the Baldwin teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes a member of the M&S brand and replaces Ant McPartlin’s ITV TV series I’m A Celebrity
One of Jones’s closest sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
“For what we fell in love with,” he said.
Trump joked about the criticism that was directed at him in the news for his comment, which some considered to be “concealed to the President,” and the over-positiveness of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his somewhat “new-street voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards the abandonment of North Korea nuclear weapons, interested in the second meeting.
However, nuclear ceasefire negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations on Saturday that North Korea did not see the U.S.-responsible reaction to the initial desarmization steps of North Korea.
He pointed out that the US will continue to put pressure on the country.
Trump's orientation was much more vibrant.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now it’s all very well between us.”
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have brought good results: there have been completed rocket experiments, has been a promotion of the release of hostages and has been arranged to bring American servants’ remains to their homeland.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for access to this full-fledged stadium, it’s better to have almost 200 people here,” Trump said.
The tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the event of the destruction of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared a prerequisite for international aid.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international help, so that the stories are a little complicated,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children brings together a team that would go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
The press representative of the National Disaster Board, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation in Palus, in order to decide whether international authorities will be allowed to contribute to assistance.
Considering the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the state is surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural resources.
Although Acehis has been built for the tsunami, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning about tsunami was given, the absence of the siren of tsunami warning probably increased the number of deaths in Palus.
Traveling between numerous islands in Indonesia is also quite a challenge in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship that stopped to treat the victims of the earthquake in Lombokis is headed to Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at a new crash site.
President Joko Widodo turned Indonesia into a central part of its electoral campaign to improve fragmented infrastructure and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, the deficits in the budget threaten Mr Joko's government, as new elections will take place next year.
Also, the tensions in Mr Jokot Indonesia are under pressure among those who are left, where members of the Muslim community in most have turned to the older form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the struggles between Christian and Muslim forces on the streets, where maths, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons were used.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturrridge hits the violin gate in the game against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturrridge saved Liverpool's loss to Chelsea in Premier League, citing the status on the 89th gamer in Stamford Bridge, London's Saturday game.
Sturridge was eaten by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from Chelsea Gate, when his team led 1 : 0.
He created the ball on his left before he hit it in the direction of a far-reaching post.
The ball flew highly over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the network.
It fell with the jumping Kepa Arrizaba and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible,” said LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, made a touch, and I gave him a little longer to think,” he said.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1: 0 was led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazardi.
In this game, the Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovac before he turned around in the middle square and fed to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic gave fast food in the middle field.
He then created a beautiful air meal, leading to Hazard's penalty.
Hazard got through the defense and created a network from the Liverpool player, Alison Becker, on the left foot.

The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument, which is “the reason for the rewriting of history”
To eliminate it would be a religious justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style, which the inhumane followers did.
But Cromwell's company described Mr. Crick's recommendation as stupidity and attempt to rewriting history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s company, said: “In the debate on the elimination of images, it was impossible to remain in touch with the monument in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster palace.
Cromwell did not attack the images in the English Civil War himself and did not tell others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man was sacrificed for the works of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation is a proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historical description of the person to whom a lot of people still think should respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Some people considered it more at the end of the 19th rather than today, as a protector of the Cromwell Parliament, external pressure and, in this case, of course, for the king’s power.
Whether it’s an accurate reflection, it’s an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the 17th-century conflict has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as the Master’s Defender deserve to celebrate and commemorate.
The Chinese farmer died with the killer
According to local media coverage, the farmer attacked the pig who killed the man on the market in Edela-China.
A man who was only identified as a family name, Yuan, was found dead and covered with blood, near the village of Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, reported on the Sunday of the South China newspaper ‘Morning Post’.
Preparation of a farmer in Qinghai Province in China on 30 May 2005 for vaccination of pigs.
He had come from Yunnan with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead and discovered that the other side was open.
He said that the intestine was a big orgy with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the trial confirmed that 249.47 kilograms of iron had been strung to death by the farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and found,” said Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found almost an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Svening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else until evidence was collected at the scene of the police.
The Yuan family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has been previously observed that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig was attacked by a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms on a farmer's tractor was nailed until a man's wife scared the animal away.
When in 2012, one of the farmers in Oregon ate their own pigs, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs would not usually attack, but that because of the taste of blood, they could go to their head.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious marathons whose goal is not to hurt.
They just have to be told enough,” the man said.
Orcan Rosa’s post-warms produce extensive rains in the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, the hurricane Rosa weakens, moving across the Gulf of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the near days of Rosa, the rain pours over to North Mehiko and the U.S. southwest.
Sunday morning at 05:00 east coast time, Rosa classified 136.78 kilometres per hour as the first category of hurricane, located 619.59 km southwest from Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean will develop a low-rise, moving east toward the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will start to move deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa reaches Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimetres of rain.
A tropical humidity that responds to the approaching low pressure will then produce extensive heavy rainlights in the south-west of the country in the near days.
At the same time, 2.54 to 10,16 centimeters of rain are caused by dangerous sudden floods, flood water, and possible paint spots in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes an increase in the precipitation of 5 to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to be between 5,08 and 10,16 centimetres of rainfalls in certain areas of the south-west of the United States, particularly Arizona.
Extreme conditions are possible due to the disperse of tropical rains with rapidly worsening conditions.
Surely, in the event of a tropical rainfall threat, you should not walk in the desert.
Strong rain can lead to rapid flow of rivers and lightning storms in some areas of breathtaking windfalls and flying dust.
The nearby low-pressure atmosphere brings with it the acute rainfalls in the southern California coasts.
It is possible that the total amount of rainfalls, which reaches more than 1.27 centimetres, can cause smaller flood water and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region.
Drunk tropical rain lights begin to approach Arizona on Sunday’s late evening and Monday’s early morning, rainfalls become extensive on Monday’s evening and Tuesday.
Strong rains arrive at Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature fluctuations in the United States are forecast to be caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while in tropical areas temperatures remain high.
Sometimes it brings great temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday’s weather is a great example of significant temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he tries to gather himself again in a long summer heat.
A large majority of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to be expected to start in October with temperatures around 80 warm maps, from the south to the northeast of the country.
New York City is expected to have a 26.6 hot map that is about 10 degrees above average on Tuesday.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern part of the United States there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people looked at Christine Blasey Ford, who was allegedly accused of sexual violence in the 1980s, through six television channels.
At the same time, the political congestion continued, where broadcasters interrupted the introduction of regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute round of the Friday: Senator Jeff Flake, Arizona, prepared an agreement with the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had drunk his head and tried to tear off his wife's clothes at the high school final party.
Kavanaugh said in his creed that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, more than 22.4 million people looked at the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels, including PBS, C-Spanish and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems with the calculation of the number of people who look at transfers in the authorities.
For comparison, it can be said that it is about the same big audience as the football final tournament or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, who has strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks to an average of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers remained in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The interest was great after the trial.
Flake was a middle character of Friday drama.
After a statement by the moderate Republican Bureau that he was voting in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man's Friday morning, when he had fallen under the protesters' whirlpool, trying to take the elevator to the courtroom.
He stood in the ground for several minutes when he was accused of being transferred to CNN.
“I’m standing right here, in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the country the truth?
He was told: “You have power, while so many women have come to power.”
Flake said that his department issued the application and added it before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected direct transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate’s plenary session.
But Flake said he's only doing this in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit critics in the political game
The Prime Minister accused the newspaper of interviewing those who review his plans to leave the European Union, in a “political game” with the future of Britain and harming national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
Another interview with the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson put pressure on Johnson’s attack on May’s Brexit plan, saying that the proposal to collect the British and EU label is “free of charge”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims dead.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison for the second-degree murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported WAFB on a TV that belonged to CBS.
After Simpson's interview, the police said the man admitted the shooting of Wayde to death.
The lawyer said the man's bail was set at $350,000 (308 600.30 euros).
The governor of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday that killed a bullet wound in his head in the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Force, the State Police Criminal Lab, the Southern University Police and the people living in the region for the assistance given to the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, the leader of LSU, thanked the regional law enforcement authorities for \"shalling and justice\".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1,98-metre man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
The average of his previous season games was 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team was hit by Wayde’s death – and “shock.”
“That’s something you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcanic ash in Mexico City
Popocatepetl's volcanic ash has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disasters Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday, telling them to stay away from the volcano, as the crate started again, resulting in a record of 183 cases of gas emissions and ash eruptions within 24 hours.
The center of the wall has several noises and vibrations.
The pictures in social media portrayed the front glass of a car covered with ash in different parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
Geophysics noticed an increase in volcanic activity of 72 km south of the capital after the 7.1 magnitre earthquake collapsed in September 2017 in the middle of Mexico.
Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police have collisions with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the collapse of the protestors of independence. Thousands joined the protests to celebrate the opposition vote on the withdrawal of Catalonia.
A group of masquerading fighters, who were holding back the martyr police, attacked the last eggs and powder color, causing thick dust clouds to the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later, the police had to use knives to control the fights.
For a few hours, “No forget, no forgiveness,” the semi-finalists of independence collapsed with the state’s unity with the advocates who called “Elagu Spain.”
According to the local press, 14 people who had suffered a minor injury were treated with medical care.
The efforts will continue to be in the region that supports independence one year later, when Madrid declared the referendum illegal on 1 October, but supported by Catalans.
The voters decided to take over the benefit of independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the opponents refused to vote extensively.
According to the Katalaan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote against the polling stations throughout the region, which led to violent collisions.
The parties to independence had stayed in front of the polls on Friday night to avoid national police-supported demonstrations.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take another way.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, who participated in the separation demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hope of seeing Catalonia as independent.
“Last year, there was one of the best moments in our lives.
“I saw my parents crying out for joy, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the independence of Catalan to maintain their work this year, as a number of more well-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been detained and are waiting for judgment on their part in organising a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who stores a demonstration to support the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was driven by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he will participate in the next year in the elections of the European Parliament.
“The European Parliament’s election is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure statements of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was ravaged with the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car in Londonderry was repeatedly raped.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. at the British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was made to the gates and buildings.
It was also possible to shoot vibunol in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga hits Livingston 1 to 0 wins in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston's victory
Published in Livingston's Open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to the second loss in 18 games, when a man has been a manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will win in the first league during this season and will be standing on the next Sunday with the leading Hearts, eight points on the earth.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Visits on Thursday in Euroliga.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss from the month after the replacement of Kenny Miler.
Livingston loses the opportunity for Nürs guests
Holt's team should have been leading the gate a long time before they hit the gate, as their direct play style caused all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts were raging in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to capture Craig Halket's headline across the gate.
The strangers were calmly allowed to play in front of Rangers, knowing that they could cause problems to the guests in certain places.
And this is also a way of hitting a determining gate.
Rangers gave up the free play and Livingston had an opportunity to play with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the sentence.
By then, Rangers mainly dominated the ball, but couldn’t break through the defense, so all of Liam Kelly’s side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate one time.
The Rangers gate wagon Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's hit and Lithgow shined brightly in another crew of Livingston.
The strikes were constantly reaching the Livingston penal area, and they were constantly kicked off. They were also directed to two punishments, one of them, Halketti Glenn Middleton's replacement attempt, and the other for touching the ball's hand.
Fenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macron Stadium
Fenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder up to the full expectations of moving up.
Their game style and players have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt needs to be honored by how he has escaped the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing an excellently organized defense while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers got inspired.
Despite their good intermediateness under Gerrard’s leadership, it remained limited according to these examples.
Their last possession of the ball turned out to be incomplete: reaching home was only a time that could be used as a alarm to Rangers located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there were smiles and concerns when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
It is President Erdogan's controversial last day of Germany's visit to improve relations between NATO allies.
They are excluded from issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan Cologne then headed to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the collection of 25,000 members in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s minds, many of whom are deaf, also made their voices heard, condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to host Turkish President in his country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude to a guest is divided: some Turkish in Germany greets him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self-government.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: the bicycle was killed as a result of a collision with the car
In London, the car was killed by a bicycle.
The crash took place at 10:15 a.m. on a fast road to Deptford, near the Cross of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide ambulances, but the man died at the scene.
A few months after the second bicycle was killed in a crash, about two kilometres from Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver who ran off the bicycle fled from the scene.
The London police said the authorities are dealing with the identification of the man and the reporting of his loved ones.
Traffic is closed and buses are re-directed, motor drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartini Prison: Six prison officials have been injured in the calms.
The Prison Office reported that six prison officials were injured in the unsafe men's prison.
His Majesty Long Lartini's prison at Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 p.m. according to British summer time and not yet finished.
One of the intertwined riots related to eight prisoners is involved in the handling of experts in homing police officers.
Prison officials were treated with milder facial injuries at the scene.
The president of the prison service said: “The prison workers with special training have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartini’s prison.
Five crew members received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible for it will be transferred to the police and their imprisonment may be extended.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison leader was told to be taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, he was called to the prison to silence the serious unrest that attacked prison officials with billiards.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with a sudden explosion (orcan be useful for subregions)
The tropical low pressure isn’t often hit by Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the raging hurricane Rosa moves over the east of the U.S. desert, leading to a sudden threat.
The National Weather Service has already organized a sudden follow-up on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa is headed straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on Monday with rainfalls.
The Phoenix State Air Service states that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept Phoenix 321.86 km in a radius of tropical storm or low pressure levels since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest national orcan centre models predict a rainfall of between 5,08 and 10,16 centimeters, which can reach Arizona Mogollon Rim in restricted areas up to 15,24 centimeters.
In other desert areas of the U.S. east, including the central part of the Kaljumäes, and the large nebula is likely to have a rainfall of between 2.54 and 5.88 centimetres, ranging from a limited area to 10.16 centimetres.
Rosa rains can be a blessing for areas that withstand acute droughts, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be useful as droughts in Southeast America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona’s extreme, i.e. the second-largest category of droughts, informed Weather.com.
First of all, the Orange Rosa Baja California Peninsula is crossing Mexico's land.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest windshields at the hurricane level, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour north.
The storm is exposed to the cooling waters of the Pacific, and it is therefore slightly shrinking.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will arrive on Mexico’s land with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja from California to Sonora can expect rainfalls with a total volume of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres, ranging from 25.4 centimetres to 25.4 centimetres,” said Weather.com.
Then Rosa moves to the north of Mexico's tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical low-rise that moves across Arizona and reaches the south of Utah on Tuesday's late evening.
“The greatest danger followed by Rosa or its subsequent events is a very strong rainfall in Baja California, the Northwest of Sonora and the desert of the U.S. southeast,” said the National Orange Center.
These rain lights can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in the deserts and paints in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four arrests related to attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspected murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A young boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00, according to British summer time.
The victim was transferred to a hospital in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested in the Radstock region in Avon and Somerset, the police said.
Officials ask to contact anyone who may have mobile phone recordings.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was a member of the Democratic Party under the influence and hatred.
“The support of Commissioner Kavanaugh is a voice against the unrelenting and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his speech in Wheelingus West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was in charge of his appointment during the process of appointment under the Democratic Party's \"Worry and anger\".
Kavanaugh gave testimony to Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasay Ford's accusations that the man attacked him decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also issued a certificate of charges at the sitting.
On Saturday, the president said, “Americans saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
The voice given by Judge Kavanaugh for the appointment of a judge is the voice to appoint one of the legal witnesses of our time who have an impeccable background in public service,” he said to the people supporting Western Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the election activity of the Republic in the mid-term elections.
“The last five weeks have remained one of our most important elections in life.
I am not a candidate, but I am actually a candidate,” he said.
“I am therefore everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that Democrats were on a mission aimed at “sitting and preventing”
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's application is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, said the senior CNN of the Republican Party leaders.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths rises
At least 384 people were killed and many threatened when the giants attacked the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in the town of Palu, when, at the time of the wilderness, the six-metre waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that remained on the road.
Tsunami followed 7.5 magnitical earthquakes.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still carried out their activities on the beach, not immediately escaped, leaving it as victims,” said BNPB, a press conference at Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, a press conference at the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but took the cars, the logs and the houses, sweeping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km per hour before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed out of the tsunami to escape the trees and survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to the center of Palu 24.
The air photos published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and water-circulated mosques.
The trails in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In the region with 2.4 million inhabitants, the earthquake wave was known.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPT) said in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake was almost 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb destroyed in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of a city located at the edge of a long and narrow bay could increase the strength of the tsunami, BPTT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extractive,” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found under the rusty of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead may be greater than the number of Palus on the coastline of the north of 300 km, called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
Reports from Donggala: “There is no information available,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300 000 inhabitants live in the community,” Red Cross said in his statement adding that its team and volunteers are heading towards the affected places.
“This is already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday that it did not inform the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said the waves arrived at the beach while the alert was issued.
Amateurs in social media have seen a man on the top floor of a building that warns against a tsunami moving on the streets below the panic.
Some of us later get to the beach by carrying houses and cars with them.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the correctness of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive electrical disruption that prevented the connection in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue work.
The military has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to help, said the authorities, but the evacuationrs still need food and other essentials.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to Indonesia tsunami increased by more than 800.
That's very bad.
While the staff of the World Vision arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the presence tents of their office, they saw the pictures of the people who were going on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Although the help forces strongly began disaster relief operations, some complained that workers from foreign aid organisations with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rules, foreign funding, stocks and relief forces may only be sent if an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be a disaster at a province level,” said Aulia Arrian, a newsman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, “Oh, it’s a national disaster, we can start to receive international aid, but such a state has not yet been declared,” he said.
When the second night in Palus arrived after Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends of the lost people and families were still full of hope that their loved ones are the wonderful cases that ease natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped two days next to her mother's body under her fists.
In Indonesia, the National Sigangel Guard Coach Gendon Subadono trained two missing slippers for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of us trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, added to Mr. Mandagi.
“I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how after the release of the news of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to Palu’s competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think it means that the messages didn’t arrive,” he said.
Vargas took €23 585.88 during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Leavees
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23 585.88 from the British official who completed the Levees ATM, was published in the Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptys the ATM and manufactures more money at the entertainment facility, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy's press release.
When the man acted, “a man behind the back of the Brink employee, and he stole a bag for delivery full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, writing a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about early persons are asked to contact the Newport police on the phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
The rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
On Saturday, a man wrote: “Edine Kanye West
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while, and the man used his name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his performance by sending Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yanth.
He replaces Ariana Grandet, a singer who canceled his concert on the “feel of feelings,” said the author.
In addition to the shortness of the current name of the man, West has previously said that it is a religious word for him.
“I think that ‘ye’ is one of the most popular words in the Bible, which means there’s ‘sina’,” said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, they are us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means “this one,” called Ye, which is merely a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West is not the only rapper playing his name.
Sean Combs is primarily known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has also used its name with and without the thought crisis, big and small letters.
Mexican politician AML promises not to use military forces against civilians.
At the time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks against students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatellco Plazas that “he would never use military forces to control Mexicans.
The army attacked a peaceful demonstration on the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people during the time the entire Latin Americas had to carry left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening up more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” Kai-Fu Lee, a financier who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an overall formal artificial intelligence strategy.
At the same time, China introduced its plan last year to be a technician for the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The duplication of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the United States and we act for the next artificial intelligence breakthrough,” Lee said.
The double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, said the interview with Lee CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, who funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked with a artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the American best Othello player. Later, he was the man on the board of Microsoft Research and the president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee recognized the technology competitions of the previous U.S. government, such as the U.S. Department of Defense Research Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition will take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“The U.S. scientists have to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“China is not the one who takes over the parents, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically provide a green card,” the man said.
The Chinese National Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
“China’s National Science Fund distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Research Fund and other government institutions allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a unified artificial intelligence centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions.
DARPA announced this month that he started to finance a two-million-dollar AI Next initiative.
But the state research fund is funding more than $100 million per year for artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the amendment of the national name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country into the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve the disputes of decades with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its name for the Northern Neighbourhood constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed on the new name of Macedonia in June, but the opponents of the nationalists claim that the name would undermine the national personality of the Slovak people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to participate in the referendum and the anti-discrimination campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity would achieve the 50% participation rate necessary to apply the referendum.
The referendum asks: \"Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid by Macedonia, one of the countries established after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure the accession of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgijevska, 79 years old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament's vote is required for the name change.
The National Electoral Committee said there were no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, electoral activity was only 16% compared to 34% of previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital of Macedonia in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duskko gave Strumica a vote on 30 September 2018 in the Macedonian referendum on the amendment of the country's name, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small stage, raising the chairs to those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We’re a poor country, but we’re still in a state of injustice.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we may turn to others, such as China and Russia, and receive European integration in Asia.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments in Macedonia with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will support the modification of the name, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of membership in the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said: “The word, yes, it would be “the confirmation of our future”
The results of the poll published by the Institute of Political Studies in Macedonia on Monday revealed that the referendum would take part in 30-43% of voters under the necessary electoral activity.
The survey conducted by Macedonia Telma TV announced that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would respond, “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The brutality of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense on behalf of the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's defense by ensuring Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguero left an impression as his 65th-game gate came ridiculously easily.
Argentina's attacker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the order.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before he ran through several players on Brighton's border.
He then put the ball on his left, where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit the Brighton Gate Guard Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” said Manchester City’s manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We told him he was playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he hit the gate at this time.
However, Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the original success of the Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got hit a ball a few times before he led Sterling further.
Sky Blues put the ball on the net just before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester City plays at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game of joyist Rockies.
When the Nationals were out of the final tournament, there was no big reason for the new beginning.
But Scherzer hopes to do the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockiesel, who runs the Los Angeles Dodger game in the US West, is still hoping to get to the final.
On Friday night, Rockies guaranteed at least a jockey place to win over the Nationals, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in this audience and another team in the atmosphere in Denver is probably higher than any other game that can wait for me this year.
Why don’t I want to compete here?
Nationals have not named the opening player yet, but are allegedly inclined to the Scherzer feed in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feeding, made a warm session on Thursday and fed normally on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player runs between 18 and 7, his ERA has 2.53, the number of strikes 300 and favorable opportunities for your 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's on the West Virginia cheering call
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Mr Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the election activity of the Republic in the arbitration elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event in which I do not apply, but I really apply, so I am everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible extreme group of Democrats, seeing this happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back the power of any means. You will see their nursing and dirty game.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don’t give them that.
Democrats are, according to his statement, on a mission aimed at “receiving and preventing”
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “women, means, naked and false.”
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, who screamed out loud among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, huh, what?
No, no, wait, it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.
The Leibrian Party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable to those who express their opinion.
When my local party activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour Members to whom you are told that you are not welcome, and all this for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, became a part of the same treatment as he was strongly opposed to Jewish.
As far as I am concerned, the judges criticized me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are, in a strange manner, similar to those in which Jeremy was dissented with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party’s Communication said: “We want meetings to be inclusive and creative.
In most cases, my eight-year local Labour Member experience with the meetings of the General Assembly of Friday nights is exactly the same.
Unfortunately, as of today, it is no longer valid for most meetings and the promise to be “the brighter and brighter” policy has long been forgotten if it was ever remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that, for each opinion, it is assessed who is acceptable to the Party’s Board.
It started immediately after Jeremy became the leader, and the co-worker, whom I thought was sharing similar political views, now waited for me to change my mind and take the views that I would never have agreed otherwise, whether it was a matter of national security or a single EU market.
Whenever I step up publicly, no matter what I actually say, it follows the condemnation in social media, encouraging my return, disregarding party politics, and saying that I should not be part of the Leiboristic Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my fellow workers because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those employees who face sexual or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer so large a community and that any “untrustful” initiative or electoral rules will become more narrow.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and “it would be fine.”
But it wasn't what I came to do in politics.
From the moment I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the Thatcher government, which had left my high school classroom at the point of direct collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services for those who need it most, acting as a member of the local council as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my policy, including in recent elections.
In no way can anyone in Nottingham East be confused about my political views or the areas of non-consistency with the local government.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, there is not the only message that I have, intended for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Leibrian Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one of the threats or political considerations of reconnaissance will stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moving to the top
Two late events may have been somewhat cumbersome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves victory in this wonderfully fun tennis first league game.
They are now the only unbeatable team in the top of the table.
After all, it was the team's high level of protection and better risk taking, which was the way home team won, and coach Peter Murchiel has the right to be fully satisfied.
“We’ve been tried all the time in the game and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: “The story of Ayri, they used their opportunities better than ours.
Grant Anderson's 14th gameminut experiment, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri a success, but for the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who gave the game Warriors, the yellow card gave Melros an opportunity to do a failed test.
At the end of the semester, Climo increased the early years of the Ayr with a penalty bar just before the end of the semester, reaching the position of the individual half-time for the benefit of the 17-5 Ayr.
But Melrose successfully began the second half, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which took over Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then a long delay took place due to the serious injury of the Ruaridh Knott, followed by a man's move on the deck. As the game continued, Ayr's development continued to increase thanks to the Stafford McDowall test, which was transmitted by Climo.
The CEO Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but again, Melrose’s player, Bruce Colvine, paid for the failed transmission of his experiment, after a strong pressure.
However, the team at home gathered strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advanced Ayries.
Climo gave the ball on, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's cast iron and sent the side guard Gregor Henry to go to the fifth test of the team playing at home.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the field of hospitality services after it was discovered that the man was appointed Director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a famous BBC TV series, which he writes and plays with Greg Hemphill, a long-term comedy partner.
A couple have announced that the first nine seasons will be the last of the series and that Kiernan will make life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan would want to enter the Glasgow-Swimming restaurant business.
“Meri is ours: Bolivia without a sea border hopes that the court will open them again along the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol the Marine headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags flying above the premises of the Authority.
Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the Marine Bases, has a leading statement: “Our master is right.
It is our duty to restore it.
The full sea border in Bolivia is a memory of the coastal line that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, still living.
These hopes are sometimes the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision taken by the International Court on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Boliival is a spirit of momentum, unity and tranquility, and the state is naturally waiting for the result to be shared,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat in Bolivia.
The Hulk Bolivists across the country look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades to give the last independent way to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Moralesel, who is expected to be re-elected next year, will have a lot of weight on Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court probably does not vote for the benefit of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and have provided that they do not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that a decision by the international court is made only six months after the final statement was heard suggests that it was not “a complex case,” said the expert in international law in Chile, Paz Zarate.
And, beyond the further causes of Bolivia, the past four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by current authorities in Bolivia,” Zrate said.
Morale's wary beauty speech has lost the charity of the remaining Chilean, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unnecessary.
On Monday, Bolivia is an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in the country’s relations with Chile, and the opportunity to “end the conflict of 139 years with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known Presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue to express political error.
“Bolivia never abandons his right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“It is possible to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea said there was no release from nuclear weapons until the state could not trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called upon the United States to review the promises made by the leaders of the competitors during the Singapore summit.
He comments when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be starting nuclear diplomacy again for more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, it is airlocks that the U.S. continues to restrict and refuse to claim a cease-fire war with Korea will give up North Korea.
Washington is careful about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang plans to seriously abandon the weaponry that the country is likely to see as the only option to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to meet another Kimi and Trump summit.
Paris Fashions bring to the viewer a series of massive headbands that bring buyers to their neighborhoods on the shopping scene
If you want to increase your cybercolony or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer have to look for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange supersonic main roofs to the stage during their summer season 2019, which blinded Paris’s fashion week.
High and impractical hats this summer are fashionable through Instagram, and these designers have sent their footwear to fashionable works.
Valentino’s top work was a brand-new overpacked beige hat that was decorated with a reputable wide edge.
Other great clothing included archbishops, wizard hats and even ananas, but their goal is not to heat.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it at exactly the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had a mixed mouth, so they remembered more Hannibal Lecter than high.
One part of the work reminded the diving costume with the air pipe and glasses, while the other reminded the melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the gigantic moorings, you're lucky.
Moeguras predict that the super-sized main roofs can also reach the shopping streets in your vicinity.
Supersized hats come immediately on the Channel of La Bomba, a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimetres, seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created a highly unconventional hat in social media sent another large piece of work – a beach bag of shoulders, almost as large as the model of the bikinis that carry it.
The Dark Orange Rafficote, which has ruffles and white leather strap, was the top of the 2019 Summer Collection of Jacques La Riviera in Paris on the fashion week of the week 2019.
The famous style of Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the next summer. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for huge clothing.
John Edward: Language skills are important to the citizens of the world.
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of the academic excellence and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, which will strengthen personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students study all over Scotland, and represented by the Scottish private school council (SCIS), are trying to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as a world citizen.
As a education sector that can shape and implement a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we can see that modern languages are still known in schools and the desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it will reach his mind.
When you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we see that the front end of the tables are languages with the highest rate of examination among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
The study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find workers for free employment, 17% of respondents to lack language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
As more creative job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage immediately.
According to YouGov’s survey conducted by more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak enough foreign languages to chat about it. The only language that was two-digital was French with 15 percent.
It is therefore important to finance language learning at this time for children today.
The knowledge of many languages, especially those with developing economies, gives children better opportunities to find good work.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at each school.
Hulk school focuses on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered most important in the UK in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what the future brings to them.
It can no longer be denied that languages in a global business environment are essential for the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be regarded as \"international communication skills\".
Private schools continue to offer young Scottishs a choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish private schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Intrusive respecters no longer have to wait to see LeBron James doing his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James is playing in a Sunday-day opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of his toys needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell's statement that James is likely to play a number of minutes.
After the training last week, James was asked about his plans in connection with Lakers’ six-player pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need my career in the current stage of pre-season games to warm myself up,” he said.
Trump West Virginia Election Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign event series at Wheeling in West Virginia this evening.
This is Trump’s first campaign event for the next week, including stations in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the confirmation vote is held until Trump elects who will be appointed to the Supreme Court's free office, he shall endeavour to increase support for the forthcoming arbitration, as the abolition of control by Republicans after the vote in November in Congress is threatened.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump’s campaign event in Wélingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 19:00 at the eastern coast.
The campaign event of Trump West Virginia can be viewed online through YouTube streaming.
The Trump Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, is likely to talk about the meetings of this week that became tense in relation to charges related to sexual abuse. At the same time, the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main goal of the campaign event series is to help new momentum for Republicans who face complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign manager said that their five-week event aims to “enforce volunteers and supporters when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“The control of Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible as the season of election campaigns,” Reuters told Trump’s campaign spokesperson who did not want to mention his name.
Today’s campaign event planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wesbanco, can bring supporters from “Ohiost and Pennsylvania, and also a reflection in the Pittsburg media,” said West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it is another time when Trump visits West Virginia in the last month. It is a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote of voters in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the protagonists on the basis of polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is nervous to compete, keeping hopes high in front of Sunday alone games
After three single sessions, the games that were held on Saturday afternoon were sometimes what Ryder Cup needed.
The evolving turning point pendele is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this here.
So where do they think it would be a turning point now?
“They led six points, which have now become four, so I think I can think of it as a turning point in a small way,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, as it is managed by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of courage, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomase, who played together all day, and either of them got three points of four.
Spieth has been on foot for both the pond and the grin and shows an example.
These beats are becoming more and more pronounced with each round, by emphasizing a determining tube that would have led to the fourth match's figment after he and Thomas were in the ground with two.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed the man's belief that the Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days have Ryder Cup at the undisputed stars of Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s strange but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood – was the only couple who didn’t hit the boyey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the boyeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into a noisy crowd as well as back, reinforces the view that players who compete with them on Sunday, and that if the sun is created over the Le Golf National, it is not possible to be the most famous player for the European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both of them are at the same time in different holes.
However, the stories of Europe’s glory are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, today with four-ball hero, a quick job when a man was put in a couple of Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine mined a Spanish and a Swedish so deep that they had no hope to dig themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out in August.
Four balls and pairs of games are extremely attractive to look closely at the interaction between couples, advice to each other, unsolicited advice, and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team and has been leading a strong success for the last day, but this nettle session showed that the U.S. team is divided into a fight with a few, especially Americans, in doubt.
Europe is located in Ryder Cup on the last day of 10-6
On the last day of Ryder Cup, Europe will be able to lead a good success, following Saturdays’ four-balls and a pair of games in front of the United States.
The great duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two winning tiger Woods to raise their current score to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European party, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the lost cartoon in Hazeltine, ruled the American side of the morning in the four-ball, winning series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the match, winning two games, but they could not replace the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points to maintain a single game of 12 single games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who is called Molliwood after that weekend, they are the second couple who have won four points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the four ball, they continued in the same spirit by subjugating Woods and American beginner Bryan Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost his 29 four-balls and a pair of 19, getting seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had sunk out in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who is the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was considered a pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a firm victory in the four-ball for 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahman and Ian Poulter, later on, and winning a pair of Poulter and Rary McIlroyd 4-3 after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going to individual games, although as owners, Furyk needs only a week to preserve half of the cup.
While being on the other side of two days, after the Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says, “Not in any way,” they are not armed unilaterally because of lack of trust.
The foreign minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions were exacerbated by their infidelity against the United States and that the state would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that in the last year, North Korea has taken “notable charity measures, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, destroying the nuclear test site, and giving the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the U.S. responding to it,” he said.
“Without confidence in the U.S., our country has no security security, and under such circumstances, we do not agree in any way to make ourselves unilaterally the first weapon.”
While Ri repeated a series of North Korea's familiar complaints regarding Washington's resistance to the \"reward-stage\" approach to nuclear-free change, on the basis of which North Korea was rewarded when it took gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pjongjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore for the first time on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards the nuclear ceasefire of the Korean Peninsula and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the formal termination of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relaxing the strict international restrictions used in North Korea.
“The U.S. requires “first-hand cease-fire of nuclear weapons” and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their objective in a forced manner, even against the declaration of war ending,” said Ri.
“It’s more important that the limitations are on our knees, it’s a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions will exacerbate our infidelity.
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted earlier by the U.S. leader in the United Nations this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between three Kim and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-ini in the last five months and added: “If one of the parties to the question of nuclear weapons was South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear weapons would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s statement suddenly differed from last year’s previous year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that turning with North Korean missiles to the U.S. continent was inevitable after “Hr. Bad President Trump called Kim’s suicide mission “a rocket man.”
This year, North Korea has completely destroyed Trump in the United Nations, Kim, for his courage to take steps towards becoming armed, but added that there is still a lot to do, and that restrictions must remain in force until the North Korea ceases to nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not have a schedule, saying: “Does it take two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter –
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should pay tribute to the measures taken by Pyongyang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"The enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue to be forcefully and unpunished until we can fully and finally confirm the nuclear cease-fire.\"
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by attempting to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with the Jewish Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea understood it only within a few hours of \"gangster-like demands\".
This month, North Korea promised to destroy missiles and nuclear complex at Moon’s meeting if the United States of America were to implement anti-dumping measures.
He said that Kim had told him that “the appropriate measures” meant security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the movement towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to relax enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course in which students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture where they learn to study with caffeine-rich night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basic principles of self-care.
According to Professor Charles Czeisler, the designer of this course, the Harvard Medical School, and the specialist professor Brigham and the Women Hospital, considered it to be the first person in the United States.
He was inspired by the creation of a course after he spoke about how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of that, a girl came to me and asked me, “Why do I have to say this now, in my last school year?”
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it created me as a priest,” he explained to Telegraph.
The course that came for the first time in the curriculum this year explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, said the university decided to take the course’s curriculum after it was found that the students were in serious sleep loss at the week of work.
An hourly course includes a number of opposing tasks.
In one part, the picture is presented from the joint platform. Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books, and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleep shortage affects the sporting results and the importance of the practice of sleeping.
The second part explains how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The university city map, along with the opposing symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily practice.
“We know it doesn’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the night learning marathons are still feeling proud, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students means that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
“The provision of high-quality sleepfalls should be a student’s “salive weapon,” which combats stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “It will even help to rise weight, as sleep shortage puts the brain on hunger, making the person constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler create a course, having participated in one of his first Harvard years.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a alarm clock for both sleep and wake-up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting caused by “blue light” because it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate under Gerrard Men
The Rangers suffered from another poor guest game when Dolly Menga was hit by Steven Gerrard, who was sent from the side, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox party hoped to win its first visit from February when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, remaining eight points behind the leader of Ladbrokes Premiership from Hears.
Menga created his gate seven minutes before the mid-term and the poor preparation of Rangers could not recover from it.
Rangers will therefore fall to sixth place, and Livingston will rise to the third place, leaving Hibernan with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problem may not be over, because Calum Spence, their attacker, needed a head wound after he was probably hit with a lost object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that led to the Ayri and Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, however, went on with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy with how his well-trained boys warmed their opponents every step.
Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate already on the second opening, when Menga's first exchange sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor Gate, but the half-sitter didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep-bodied Kaaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halketti, but this defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a large-scale shot in the back of the post.
The Rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he would have had to get a punishment strike when he bumped into Steven Lawless on the 15th gamer, Judge Steven Thomson was not satisfied with the appeal of Columbia player.
Rangers managed to target only two hits in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about Lassana Coulibally’s headlines or the Ovie Ejaria event.
While Liv's 34th-minute opening might have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performances.
Another time Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher created a ball for Scott Robinson, who maintained peace and chose Menga, who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted in the meantime, changing to Coulibally Ryan Kent. This exchange nearly paid off when the edge player split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fed his place to retreat.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the kind of game that fits those where Lithgow and Halket picked up long balls.
At the end of the day, he could have promoted his leadership, but McGregor stood firmly, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow made a big corner.
Rangers’ substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again applied for a penalty when he went to the door with Jacobs, which Thomson did not meet again.
Almanahh: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanhis: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger also became a popular culture in the 1950 film, called Coronado Watches, where the main parts were seemingly unlikely to have come from the cowboys, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What else is this?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear the aatomical pod that is released from the radioactivity of minerals. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s just going to pop.”
\"Hans - Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see - pettur cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to feel as part of the treatment of pettur cells
Methods include taking immune cells from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
They will then be able to “see,” a common protein for many cancers, and they will be injected back.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect pettur cells disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers, and then they are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 - is guided by the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, in which patients receive immune cells and are taught to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West began with Trump's supporting tribe, wearing the MAGA hat directly from the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
You will receive the Saturday Night Live studio at Kanye West, after his mixed speech, in which he approved US President Donald Trump and announced his application for the same position in 2020.
After his third song, which was named Ghost Town, and where he wore a hat letter to Make America Great, he began to scream against Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“I’ve been talking so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a race?’
“If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the setting with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made a joke about Bert Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judges' committee on alleged sexual violence against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show did not go into the ether, West’s embroidery cameras were loaded in the social media of Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West.
He also complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes in connection with his hat.
“They mocked me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat in my head.
They laughed at me!
And then they say I've drowned in a place,\" he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the drowned place? I’ll put my Superman’s stick on, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love.
His comments fired the viewers on at least two occasions and seemed to be embarrassed by the SNL team. According to Variety, one person published: “All studios remained deadly.
West was brought to the scene to replace Ariana Grande, because the former boyfriend of the singer, rapper Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
West was amazed by many songs, “I Love it,” at which time he appeared as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who said: “To one brave soul: WE ARE HELPED BY FUTURES
But CEO Karen Hunter said West was simply “the one who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I decided to honor ME (including my music or clothing or supporting his “artist” to someone who, in my opinion, believes and distributes a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West”
He is not the first singer to change his name by following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has also named the Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly-spoken music legend Prince, who has transformed his name into a symbol.
Murder investigation charges related to loading of the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.

The charge is examined by the public prosecutor.
The fame of the Trojan game Kit Harington does not approve of masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his flashy role as Jon Snowina HBO in a violent medieval fantasy series of Trojans.
But the actor (31) puts down the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be harsh.
Speaking of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “what has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Troon game with Rose Leslie (31) admitted that he feels “hardly” that this problem needs attention.
“I feel quite personally that we have gone wrong somewhere with masculinity,” he said.
“What we have taught men, when they grow up, in relation to the problem we now see.”
Kit believes that the increase in the masculinity of the bet is partly responsible for television, because it shows superman characters.
He continued: “What is co-born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be the same as they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
“For something has obviously gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview he also admitted that after the end of the series, no Troon game would ever participate in the next summer, saying that he was on the one side of his battle fields and horses.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepardi participates in the revitalization of True West, a story about the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actress recently announced that she considered meeting her wife Rose the best thing to do about the Troon game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played with Emmy in the prestigious fantasy series Ygrette, Kit's character Jon Snow loved.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
According to health care professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have come from having sex, changing the past.
HIV spread in some parts of China via blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed the conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
HIV spread through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was established in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBTs is allegedly high.
The study shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transfers of diseases are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking the data of the employee GOP senator, saying that it is “safe to lie and “conspiration theories”
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by ‘ultra-paremales’ trolls and their websites.
“The lies, the lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information published included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (Luna-Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate panel in connection with claims of sexual overthrow against the Supreme Court’s candidate Bret Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked a little after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pound and RedState announced that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was linked to the Waters office and provided the membership information of the employee under Waters, Hill said.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are at risk due to their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way liable for this information breach.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie.
Waters’ statement was quickly reviewed online, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is caused by anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has a conscience that is not appropriate for the Congress member.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be angry.
They must not be trotish.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticship of Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry at the time of the Thursday hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who will apply for Waters in the interim elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It was true that it was true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims”
“We do everything we can to identify criminals,” he continued, “and that they would be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees,” he said.
An overview of Johnny English Strikes Again - the under-represented Rowan Atkinson spy parade
Today, it is the custom to look for Brexit in all new British films and it seems particularly appropriate in Johnny English’s bachelor’s parody series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became consistent with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to joke about how clearly stupid we are in the country's new export facility?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things again in his crafty way - and that this broad comic creation is designed for non-English-speaking film areas.
Of course, it’s a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smut glamour, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a little character who gave a tone to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the character traveler and international mysterious Atkinson, once played in forgotten Barclaycard television ads, which only leaves chaos behind.
This last JE film has only one or two pleasant moments.
I liked Johnny's approach to the English helicopter when he wore a medieval iron wart and the helicopter's wingers for a while, and he threw it against the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift is shown to make a physical comedy, but humor seems to be less important and wonderfully overdosing, especially when “truths” spy films such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves offer a self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English’s clever adventures are not as inventive and focused as the Atkinson dark films Beanina.
Today, there is an ever-ending assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker has invaded the UK’s highly secret spy network, revealing all the personalities of British secret police officers, making it a great disappointment to the on-site agent – regrettably a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and in need of a character who suffers from political un popularianism: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character perfectly, but there is not much to work on.
His intelligence advisors recommend that, as all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a college master in one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English will be returned to Whitehall for extraordinary information and will be reunited with his former long-time partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service obstetrics, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurõlenko's bodyed beautiful femme face with Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling under the arm of the charismatic technical billionaire. He claims he can solve all the British computer problems: the unhappy Jason Volta, who is playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their thirstful ideal: hiding themselves as a waitress, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, curbing the secret Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a genuine fit when he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and stormy as it is, the whole thing is on the side of children's TV makeup.
It's a pretty mid-range stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I found myself thinking: Is the British film industry not really giving Rowan Atkins a role that would be fair to his talent?
The working party denies the preparation of a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has considered a radical plan that provides that Britishs work four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s superiors to transfer the savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional free day.
This is how employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would get the same salary.
According to the subject, this idea would be suitable for a party’s economic agenda, and this is how the country intends to tilt to the benefit of workers.
The four-day work week has been approved at the Trade Union Congress to enable workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
The working party’s source told The Sunday Times: “It is said that the Bill’s review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This does not happen overnight, but Thursday’s work week is an effort that is consistent with a party’s approach to balancing the economy in favour of both workers and a party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such ideas, because the Green Party also promised a Thursday week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The president of the Labour Party said: “The working week of the party has no party policy and no party will discuss it.
Vice-President John McDonald used the Work Party conference last week to clarify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back power from communal companies, seen from leaders, and “Castum Serviceers”
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire participation, because the Labour Party could make ‘conceptions’ in relation to the perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the board of directors of the company and to create ownership funds to give 10% of the private sector’s equity to employees instead of providing annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about “60 Minutes” whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The investigation of accusations filed by the FBI against the judge, Mr Kavanaugh, has delayed the final vote on applying to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the conclusions of the Bureau could affect the termination of the support of Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, you can ask “60 Minutes,” co-sponsor Scott Pelley from Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
\"I said I'd go to the interrogation, and I said, \"I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, confident, and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems to be bald.
“I’m confident in my decision with Mr Kavanaugh and could only be changed in the bombing,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know that Brittany denied it forcefully,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people he has appointed could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Civil Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the annual music event is organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a hugely impressive participation of celebrities and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
The Global Citizen Festival now sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn for the seventh time not only enjoying such singers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a global poverty project for the expansion of the Global Poverty Project, which is an international law firm that hopes to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How successful has Global Citizen been when 12 years have been to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to give people a free concert a real way to convince them to act or is it just another click error, where people feel that they do something important by signing a statement online or by snoring?
Since 2011, Global Citzen has registered more than 19 million of its supporters, trying to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of their commitments and policies that affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to the 390 commitment and notification resulting from their activities and of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The Group appreciates the direct impact of guaranteed funds on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main obligations include the partnership of investors and implementingrs in the UK, the Power of Nutrition, committed to “to help children take advantage of all their capabilities,” allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help the country stop malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 calls from Global Cities.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical feature of social injustice,” the Ambassador to Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, said in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities in the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which reaches the 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website asking, “which makes you think we can stop extreme poverty.”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-parheid movements, we are sure to succeed because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, is just a few performers who take up this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the naval strike to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy, if necessary, to avoid the impact of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has published.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s participation in Syria, especially if it is called upon by a legitimate government, is a pretext in the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to exchange energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity to ensure that the sealines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement was translated into the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance. It is a non-profit company, which represents the voice of the U.S. energy consumer.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-tripping poni” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is tasked with increasing the exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to dispel the “ineligible” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin Moscow into a prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $111 billion, doubled the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce response to the project has been driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of publishing pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said US Energy Minister Alexander Novak at a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. attitude has received a feedback from Germany that has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Union (BDI) called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and Berlin and the bilateral agreements in Moscow.
“It is a big problem when the third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union, after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would seriously consider a presidential candidate in the interim elections.
At the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the weight of his application.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and it also includes the first widow,” said The Hill.
“From November 6th, I am seriously considering applying for Presidentship.
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s activities in the Town Hall, saying that he “takes the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published criticism for Trump and its candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said: “We need an FBI investigation before we vote.
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents do not think he should be nominated in 2020.
According to the political research centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe poll, 58% of the likely- Massachusetts voters thought that the senator should not be nominated.
32% supported this application.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, 38% supported possible applications and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with the possible application for 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decided by January, Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump’s collection of Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruiting from September to September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with the case of domestic violence and charged with charges
“What my son lives through, which he experiences when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who feel the consequences and wounds of PTSD that our soldiers are returning to,” he told Donald Trump at the gathering in Tulsa.
Palin called for his son to be arrested “in the living room,” and said in connection with his son and other war veterans, “they come back a little differently, they come back to be punished, they come back to think of whether there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all other military forces have given to the state.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the police officer Dan Bennett, said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, domestic violence report in intervention and possession of a gun in a drunk state.
18 states and the Columbia Region challenge a new asylum policy
The eighteen countries and the Columbia region are supporting the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits asylum victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 countries and regions presented a statement of court friends in Washington to support the emerging policy of the asylum seeker, NBC News said.
The full name of the applicant is Grace v Sessions, which was submitted by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August against Union policy, has not been published.
She said that her co-worker, and her violent gang members, abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to submit asylum applications.
Karl Racine, Chief Prosecutor of the Columbia Region, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"is not going to be a state, union and international law for decades\".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle,” the Court said.
In the short statement, the lawyers also claimed that the ban on the entry of immigrants would harm the US economy, saying that they would likely become entrepreneurs and \"will offer the necessary workforce\".
Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions told immigration courts in June not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence.
“The request for asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or a certain social group or political opinion,” the Sessions said in a communication of 11 June.
The aim of the shelter was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Spiritual rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled by finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very stressful,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kuuma, who comforted her fever at the evacuation center of the town of Palu.
“Every minute new people arrive with ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the things that they found, and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been damaged by a 7.5-grant earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including broken back and shoulder, were rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were still treated due to strong extremities in outdoor conditions.
The tears filled his eyes when he remembered how strong the earthquake shook his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It was time to save yourself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in ruins,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're not in danger.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of bullying the media.
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four pages of advertising under the US daily news about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the addition paid by China Daily at Des Moines Register - Iowa State's largest pioneer newspaper - after China was accused of in intervention in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing attempted to intervene in US elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other's import tariff is adjusted.
China's counter-measures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to catch states like Iowa exporters, as they supported the parties of the Republic of Trump, Chinese and US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China’s largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing torture ads in our free press.
“In the distribution of the propaganda, the Chinese government uses American expensive freedom of speech and free press practice, placing its paid advertising at Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, there are only limited votes in the Beijing Street Cake, and there are no real differences in opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is under the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say what kind of newspaper it was.
Analyzers warn that the Republicans will host women’s electives before the interim elections with Kavanaugh’s fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a return in the coming interim elections, especially women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in stock, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on voting.
“These things cannot be taken back,” said Professor Grant Reeher of Policy Sciences at the University of Syracuse, at Maxwell’s school, in his article published on Saturday at The Hill.
Reeher suspected that the last minute's attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI would be sufficient to calm the hate voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said the senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn according to the newspaper Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning, the protestors repeated the statement of protesters, “November is coming,” as Republicans who control the judges’ committees decided to go on with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic ind and internal damage begins to be out of graphics,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But this can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters aged 18-29 who do not like and often fail to vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a return when Republicans were moving forward with confirmation.
“This has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week.
“This does not only concern the Commission’s vote, the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh was appointed, it also concerns the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” said Chief Guy Cecil, U.S. (a group that helps the Democrats to choose) to draw attention to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in Ford and who, after the testimony, Kavanaugh, are a little more supportive of the first.
YouGov’s new poll showed that 41% of respondents believed or likely for Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh would probably or probably have lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims and at least one other accusation of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Last week, Ford admitted to the Senate's judge committee that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his family life when they attended a party in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet that would put the breast on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a start-up company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The final project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds up the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to information.
In exceptional polling to Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal is to “govern the world.”
“Let’s do it now,” he said.
\"This is a historic moment.\"
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online database” or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online dataset makes it unique that the user can choose who can access this information.
The company shall designate it as ‘for the provision of personal powers through data’.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company generates sources, processes, and relevant skills to help all of Solid.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM purchased security platform, some developers hired to work on the project under the contract, and the voluntary coding community.
From this week on, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google whether to introduce a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask their permission,”
In a post published in the media, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the network's impartiality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will become the founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the spiritual monument of Victoria was opened in World War I
During the First World War, the Church of England, which was baptized in Victoria, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Lieutenant-General Bernard Vann fought for his honour on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglis and Lehaucourt attack.
But he died four days later through the sniper's bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military rank.
His two sons opened a monument on Saturday in Rushden at Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “Genically symbolic,” if the stone opened exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s award-winning struggle.
According to London Gazezet, Colonel Vann led his Battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentini on 29 September 1918, with a very thick mist, and a bullethole of bullet pilots.
Later, he rushed to the attack line, and led it to the “greatest galaxy,” before he rushed to one bullet pilot alone, and created three opposites.
Lieutenant Vanni killed German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when only a little more than a month left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s action was “what I know I can never repeat, but for which I always thank you.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set a parade for the duck, led by Brentwood's conspiracy youth band.
Michael Vann said he had “very great honour to participate in this parade,” adding that “the presence and support of so many people shows that the true hero is appreciated.”
The MMA fans looked at Bellator 206 all night, but only saw Põrsa Peppat
Imagine that you’ve been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but that’s not the main event for you.
The San Jose match included 13 battles, including six main maps, and it was shown on Channel 5 throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussis and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other, the UK viewers had their mouths shut down, because Põrsas Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not inspired by it, especially by those who were awake until early hours to see that fight.
One fan described the transition to children’s comics on Twitter as “a joke of everyone.”
“This is government regulation that at 6 a.m. the content was no longer suitable and they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of Bellatori on marketing and communication issues when they were asked about the transfer.
“Peppa, yes,”
Bellator President Scott Coker said they intend to work on drawing up their schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about replay, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we can’t do it before our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was the rule of government.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show the reference - as we usually do - we tried to offer fans more and we just went over time.
This is about the situation of the clairvoyant.
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality.
Tom Daley, the Olympic winner, says he grew up feeling that he is inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to achieve success.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn’t understand until high school that “some of them aren’t like him,” he said.
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4 sent Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed his attitude to winning the Olympics, giving the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You will receive a regular long-term escort from Kirsty Young due to his illness to take a few months off.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that when she grew up, she felt less valuable than others, because it wasn't socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, the feelings that I am not worthy and feel different have given me power and strength to be successful.
He wanted to prove that he was “whatever” worthy, and did not disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time pronks-Olympic winner has become a leader of the highly rated LGBT campaign, using its appearance in the games of the People's Community of the Year in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky that he could live openly without the consequences and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - \"Blessed him as a surprise.\"
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you live so much when you were young,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar elevations and swords.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all prospects” have changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything had to do with winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are a lot more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that “Father, you can’t sit in the front row, because by then you won’t be able to,” he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted he was not invincible,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of the people of the home in the Olympics, it’s not a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still creates chicken skin for him.
Desert Island Disc is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mockelson was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid a miserable milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday match and a four-ball game.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into two, an incentive and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hiter, not even at the peak of your career, is especially suitable for playing on a narrow Le Golf National Golf course, where a long karm of the trail is constantly punishing a lost hit.
And if the square itself is not very scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth contest with the exact British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, at the beginning of the 12 single games, start with four points, the competition of Mickelson can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he did not have much more to add.
“He fully understood his part today, pat me on his shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said that he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“She’s very confident.
He is famous and has given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but it went like this, and we had to choose such a path.
He wants to be out, like everyone else.
Mickelson passes from Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the best player in Ryder Cup games.
It can mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven figs, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team an additional spiritual contribution.
“She’s funny, mocking, breathtaking, she likes to have fun with people, and she’s just great in the team room,” she explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see it.
He offers much more than just a game.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great country of success will soon disappear.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup in the last day can easily become an unpleasant experience.
At the 1997 competition in Valderram, the Danish public, where, along with Captain Seven Ballesteros, five-point successes were held before the Americans, but at the end of the final line it was dramatically reduced, the victory was won only with a result of 141-2 : 131-2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had a great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderramas, where we won it very badly,” Bjorn said in the picture after Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 Fridays and yesterdays with 10: 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can repeat.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal to win the cup, and so we focus on it.
I’ve always said, I’m focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who are our opponents – the best players in the world –
With the satisfaction of his players playing on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to get ahead of things.
Tomorrow is a new obstacle.
Tomorrow we read personal performances, and so it’s something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent, if things go well, but if you're there in person, you'll be tested as a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to the players - to do your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's got to go and do it himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act better personally than their opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four points.
Furyk has experienced both in these last days, being part of the Brookline victory team before becoming part of the loss of Europe's \"Medinah miracle\".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw urged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start with a fire like Brookline and like Medinahis.
When the momentum goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team according to and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel that tomorrow can be born wonder.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the contest and is the best match with Barry McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the race.
“I put my boys in this line, because I think we’re so well covered,” Bjorn said.
Germany’s new warship was postponed again
The German navy's latest high-speed sailboat should have come into operation in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War with the early warships, but this will not happen until the next year due to the damage systems and the increased costs of the snowball, the local media said.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuertemberk class high-speed sailboat ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four ships in Baden-Wuertemberg, ordered by the navy in 2007, replace the old Bremen-class high-speed jets.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, and some hidden technologies such as reduction of radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed parcels should be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that high-level warships, which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad, are already becoming old at the time of the occupation.
The failed F125 high-speed carrier appeared in news last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into use and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Vossi shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important \"software and hardware shortages\", which made the warship unusable if they had been used in the fight mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the navy to add future innovations.
The 7,000 tons of “Rheinland-Pfalz” is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project, including training, will also become a problem.
It has been said that it will reach EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest high-speed sails become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy's capacity is declining.
At the beginning of the year, Mr Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy had actually \"exhaustible ships run out\".
The official said that this topic has grown as a snowball over time, because the old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He was sorry that none of the high-speed jets in Baden-Wuertember were able to join the navy.
National Trust explores the secret life of bat mice
The purpose of a new study conducted in Scotland mountainous land is to reveal how leather mice use the landscape to find their own food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protection measures.
The study of the Scottish National Trust researchers monitors the traditional and soprano pillars in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-earnings and Daubenton bats.
Special recordings are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activities of leather mice throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers also carry out field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency and species of skin bites.
A map and report of habitats will then be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
The NTS Natural Protection Officer Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show what habitats are most important for leather mice and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for leather mice and other related species.
In Scotland and the UK as a whole, the population of leather mice has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a threat, as well as flying papers and chemical processing of certain construction materials, as well as attacks on cats from pets.
Leather hair isn't really dark.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch the harvest.
They use complex echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
More than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, NTS is very serious about batting.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, surveys, and sometimes save.
The organization has even created the first and only special leather mouse reserve in the Threave area of Scotland in Dumfrie and Galloways, where eight of the ten types of leather mice live in Scotland.
David Thompson says this area is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave, we have a big area for bat mice,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still a lot to discover about bats, so that the work we do here and in other areas will help us to better understand what they need.
He emphasizes the importance of controlling skin mice before starting maintenance in real estate, as the unwanted destruction of one of the breeding and delivery sites can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Leather mice are protected and killing, harassment or destruction is illegal.
The Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said, “We still have so much to learn about our skin mice, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their bodies feed.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, while lawyers are planning to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected rape charges as \"criminal news,\" saying that people \"will advertise themselves,\" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue for the accusations of the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of rape of Kathryn Mayor in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid EUR 330 643,10 to the women’s money, so that the incident would not be discussed, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
By turning to Instagram’s direct video of its 142 million followers after accusations, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “the debtor news.”
“No, no, no, no.
Today is the wrong news,” said the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel’s court for “unauthorized disclosure of suspicion in relation to privacy.”
Advokat Christian Schertz said that the player is requesting compensation for “moral damage, which corresponds to the difficulty of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event occurred in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in the night club, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly returned to the hotel room where he allegedly was raped, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged case and told him that he was “99 percent good man,” of whom “one percent is wrong from the bottom.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution, because he was afraid of “hands tax.”
Now, a 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United during the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to the giant Juve with a transaction of EUR 100 million in relation to Italy.
Brexit: The U.S. can begin to regret the exit of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom, for the last time, would lose its position as the leader of the world’s automotive industry after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota KK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily be suspended at the production plant near Derby in Burnaston.
“We have a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the cross-border stops without Brexit agreement can be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures vehicles in Toyota Auri and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop of the production process in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says he closes the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of Brexit agreement.
Toyota’s production line works according to the need for spare parts to arrive from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement signed on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and shortcomings in parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day’s stock at Derbyshire’s factory, so the production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future relations with the EU is “fully calibrated to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We want the best solution that would allow us to do what we want, and not only to use the current success, but to take advantage of the whole opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4 show today.
“Thinks not only about Toyota, but also about other producers show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain kit.
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalari, a representative of the Union of Unite, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From our experience we know that when jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government spokesperson said: “We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's big bets meeting with Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest candidate, Bret Kavanaugh, said.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, investigating the intervention of Russian elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the possibility of blocking the President’s justice.
Whether Trump triggers the chief prosecutor and thus threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's rumors have been lit for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of surveillance tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing President 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reporting that he was going to step back.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then at the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate's judge's committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both lessons.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press release Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
If he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep an eye on the press, as always.
Some journalists would challenge this statement: Sanders did not have a White House press conference from 10 September.
Captain Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information lessons was not due to the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I am not arguing against the fact that they are disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president will make more questions and answers to the session than any president before him,” he said, without adding evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that and you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks, so it's happening during the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, before the gathering of journalists, he was on a free trip and sometimes with a strange look.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU employees in NHS Scotland regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish for their post-Brexit stay.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when the UK has remained less than six months before the withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of the status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the return between the UK and the EU, headed towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also prepared for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I value every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie passed after the head trauma to the emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers Supporter Christion Abercrombie passed an extraordinary episode after Saturday’s head injury and defeat 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the mid-term.
“He fell on the side and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before he was placed on the carrier frame was taken away from the field for further inspection.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV-Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center is over.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/range of injury, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State during his first season after his arrival in Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay higher temple fees when purchasing real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay higher temple fees if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will damage Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to 120 million pounds per year to assist homeless people.
Foreigners must pay a higher rate of temple tax if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to assist homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to harm Jeremy Corbyn’s desire to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable living opportunities and target high-income people.
The tax is taxed by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, referring to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The additional fee, which is in addition to the current temple fee, including higher levels, established two years ago on the second home and on the purchases related to the development, may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the non-UK residents purchased in London, which raise prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get their homes down.
Many wealthy regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become “immigrant cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices if they buy land, but do not use it, and he called May to give up the allowances for affordable homes in order to improve the shame of Britain’s housing.
Corbyn has announced a review of the reform of the residential economy, including rent control and termination of the exploitation of innocent people.
He also wants to empower councils to build new homes.
May said: “In the previous year, I promised to devote myself as prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
However, it is right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies from abroad, are as easy to buy homes as many people from a busy British population.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and tough sleeping conditions are a normal reality.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland,”
The head of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his “last goal” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scottish (42) rejoices in the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, who is currently in the third place in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Master League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and it was limited,” Ross BBC said to Scotland.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hamburg, and it’s always something that has drawn me back.
This option will only come when I’m in the leadership of a successful club.
Ross's predecessors were head of Sunderland, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear of such great and well-known names, had previously been opposed by Barnsleys and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it’s a success when I can take this club to the Masters League.”
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Masters League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I can only see myself successful if I can bring the club back to it.”
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, prior to being Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among the management staff of the Hears.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third level and made the lowest position of St Mirren the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirrenis and Hamilton Academy.
“This was a true crossroad,” he recalled.
“I really believed that driving was more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange, because I did it, I got a reasonable income and enjoyed some peaks.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do every week.
I’m still experiencing this in my work with tension and pressure, but the management just seems to be right.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I’ve ever been in adulthood.

According to the study, the best time for the surface is on Saturday at 17.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of British pubs in trouble, but more pressure has come to restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars went up by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA consulting company, composed of these figures, said: “The continued participation in the world championships of sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ turnover increased by 2.8 percent, except for the fact that restaurants were even more difficult.
In June, trade in reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and are the least liked restaurants.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not so dramatically as restaurants.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food fell by three per cent –
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events remains the greatest factor in sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the drop in sales is 4.8 percent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressures.
Long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August give some vital relief.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing of the brand-related institutions.
The sales monitoring of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses 47 operational group performance data with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is a benchmark for the industry.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study found that one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study conducted among 20,000 gymnasists found that “sells Insta - Pages Growth
The news elevated the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a “based account” for showing parents.
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study conducted among 20,000 gymnasists found a significant increase in the accounts of Insta (reference to Instagram).
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic account to show their parents and accept them.
One discovery of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret page saw that a teenager called on others to rape themselves.
Digital Awareness UK and private school association Headmasters and Headmistresses – Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds owned two profiles and half of them recognized the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchananan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online, where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilith Doyle becomes a sportsman at the Scottish Athletics Board
Yesterday Doyle was elected a non-executive director at the Scottish Athletics annual meeting.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most renowned winners and Chairman Ian Beattie described what happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Neidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the U.S. and elsewhere in sports communities, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of calling his leadership,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I wish to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can contribute to Scotland’s sport in real terms and contribute to its development.
The American who won the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 meters of total Olympic gold and now shares his opinion in the BBC often failed to walk after the trans-irritory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a robbery a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I was back and when, to what extent, only time will be displayed.
I've done a rough job, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for encouraging messages.
Breast pump advertising, which compares women to cows, divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertising, which compares the nursing mother to the milky cows.
“To mark the world’s first silent breast pump, the technology company Elvie’s ironic music video, published a similar advertisement to the world’s first silent breast pump, to present the freedom that this new pump gives to the mothers who wanted to live.
Four real mothers dance with the hay-filled table with cows and sing: “Yes, I will shorten themselves, but you won’t see me in the tail,” and “If you didn’t notice, they are not uduras, they are my breasts.”
Repeats salm: “Pumpa, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my lady’s cakes with milk.
However, advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has produced opposite opinions on the internet.
77,000 times viewed and thousands of comments video viewers are in disagreement. Many of them say it illuminates the milk industry’s tents.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and born for milk production, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in the days after birth,” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not stick to the breast-feeding bra in the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “It is quite traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to advertise the breast pump of the mothers who have received them?
Someone added: The absolutely inexhaustible ad –
Part of it's for advertising, and one woman thought it was a pleasure.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it for myself if I still had my breasts.
The pumping of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It is a generic product,” wrote one.
Another remarked: “This is a fun advertising (including in your workplaces or toilets) for pumping and self-recognizing mothers.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all danced in bras with non-obtrusive pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel cowy.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and does not look like a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move, keep children and even go out during the pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and annoying introduction.
With women’s ability to express and compare milk industry cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of the breast and all its challenges, while presenting in a entertaining and familiar key an exceptional amount of freedom created by the new pump.
It's not the first time the news has reflected the elvie pump.
In London’s fashion week, the mother of two children was released by the designer Marta Jakubowski.
Thousands of migrant children went quietly to the Texas border camp
The number of children of injured migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because Trump’s administrator’s enforced harsh rhetoric and policy has made it difficult to establish children with sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they are afraid to violate their country’s possibility of further staying, so they demand the child’s right to care.
The threat increased in June, when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult households could present fingerprints and share data with the resettlement authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior agent for immigration and customs organization, admitted last week to Congress that the Agency arrested a dozen people who did not seek financial support for the accompanying minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have a criminal past.
80 percent of sponsors or sponsors are illegally staying in the country and a large number of them are criminal backgrounds.
So we continue to follow them,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month after the arrest.
Many protect immigration judges from their legal content by videoconferencing, to show up.
The disappropriation will quickly be sent out of the country.
According to the asylum staff and the reports of the system published in recent months - the longer the child stays under custody, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which may lead to violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more current in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s weight loss may remain between two eyes due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without having enough time to get used to it or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, many of which are already in difficulty.
Syria demands immediate departure of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, although the state has been in war for the eighth year.
Moualemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces on the Syrian surface were unlawfully pretext of the counter-terrorism and are dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said at the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war against Syria was almost over – more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “war” in this sacred war until we have cleaned the entire territory of Syria, both from terrorist groups and from “any foreign force that is illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war.
Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused of unconvinced fears that prevent the arrival of refugees from spreading part of the Western countries.
“We came to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their faces,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that recovery aid will not be granted until there is no cease-fire agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent treaty between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer for the last rebel base in Idlib, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the widespread capture of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the three million provinces.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty has “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would be hit by jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be destroyed.
United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convince the new committees of government and opposition members to design the post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for choosing.
Moualem called on the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to looking at the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is also selected for second term
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next election in 2020 if the office and the scandal had not previously completed its presidential office, as the liberal viewers probably want.
“The most exciting ending of the President’s Office”
Currently, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled in CNN to over 1.05 million and MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the top hour. Compared to the 1.7 million viewers of four years ago, their number has increased. MSNBC gets “The Rachel Maddow Show – 3.5 million cable viewers have kept this rating high during the main night news.
“This is the tension that we are involved in, because we do not understand it,” said ABC drama, “Designated Survivor,” the head of the government secretary, who will become president when the attack is destroyed by the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys- Club,\" has another theory.
He remembers the pre-election of 2016 elections in Boston.
The leader told him he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why,” he asked.
“He said he would make me laugh,” said Mrs. Scovell.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not as the other TV shows, Washington’s rumors can become a fate for the future of Roe v Wade and reunite the desired immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the theme is just the luxury of viewers.
However, a six-hour story show of Bob Woodward’s “based background study” for his book “Fear” and Paul Manafort 13 225,73€ of the city’s Jamber jacket (Washington Post said of this “excessive self-confidence in an exhilarating dress,” and Stormy Daniels’s findings with a description of Mr. Trump’s anatomy’s wealth, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a real life series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the director of the series “Pandikuns,” the creator of Brent Montgomery Trump’s performance with the immediate actors and day-to-day plan of the show with his trousers (the norming with the NFL, the praise of Kim Jong-uni).
You can't leave any part of it in between two eyes or you're down.
At Fleiss this week, his home on the north shore of Kahai had a warm 80 degrees, but he was dressed in the room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not give up on how Bert Kavanaugh will act in the Senate's Legal Committee and how the Supreme Court's fate hangs on his hair.
“I remember at our time doing all kinds of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

On the other hand, cash flows to the hottest White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania will receive a cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the Congress Area by bringing two dominant operators to the same place.
As a result, the first number of the suburbs of the district of Pittsburgh was re-elected from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the second district in the last spring of extraordinary elections.
Lamb's opponent is Keith Rothfus, the Republican, who is currently representing the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in the larger section with the new 17th.
The maps were changed after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, so the old districts were divided into anti-constitutional electoral areas, favouring the Republicans.
The elections in the 17th century have saved the power of a campaign where the financial departments of the largest political parties are more than money - the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after winning a lot of viewed March 18 in Pennsylvania in extraordinary elections.
The Republican has been doing this for several decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political polls have given Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small return to Washington.
Mr. Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and owned the Panama hotel until the partners threw Trump out the company’s administrative team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to call back the leaders of the United States of America from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, as the Ministry's press agent Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, the plan was only to punish El Salvador, who received $ 140 million from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic momentum.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level consultation aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent the relocation of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the meeting and to end the discussion on any El Salvador sanctions.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being reviewed, speaking in the middle of October to talk about government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions at the request of anonymity.
Their discussions confirmed the government’s close analyst, who also spoke on the requirement of anonymity.
History of study
Next, it may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on the possible jurisdiction of Trump, for which there are many evidences in the state archive.
Mueller also claims to investigate whether Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress should change the party, Trump must report in this institution as if he would go back to talk to voters and perhaps even his peers with judges.
There are many however, and I do not want to point out that either Trump or his European colleagues are inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean that affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We missed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual killings.
History is going around with such an unloved march of revolutions and democracy coming closer or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump triggers Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the boiling water since it was announced that last year he made a proposal for the secret recording of the President and speculated on the inappropriateness of that position.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to react if the newly requested FBI’s investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, do we vote for Congress in the central elections if Trump should be held responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter holiday.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was the Czechoslovakian Jew who was strangled by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz who ever took over and used our ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me the light of the Sabbath candles on a table with a hammer.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic before the Battle of Rapid Vienna
Rangers organises Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was previously followed by an impressive link to Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, puts them in a strong position to become a European League G group.
The fire injury did not allow the central player Graham Dorrans to play the first game of the season before 2: 2 weeks of the end of the game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result to get better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went to the game, believing we could achieve something and leave the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and again in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but because the people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave behind the previous season and be successful.
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said he had talked to his children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance activities of Nationwide.
This should begin.
Tell your wife and children: You can’t prepare to care for your family if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for their expenses.
Your funding opportunities for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid financial life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or early self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the es.
Make sure that you have a healthcare credentials to determine a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow you at the time of your wish if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the trust in your finance.
Choose a reliable person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and she’s on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you can be ready if necessary.
“This is not only about the financial side, it is also important for those who are doctors,” Martin explained.
What medicines are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu in the city of Indonesia on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths still increases.
Since the connection has been interrupted, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala Regent on the north side of Palu, which remains closer to the epic of the 7.5-magnite earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
The request is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located at the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and the population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it suddenly hit the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regents is a region that extends over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the island of Sulawes.
In the Regents, which is the administrative area under the province, there were an estimated 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawes province, especially the Donggala coast.
In the province, it is also important to mine nickel, which is mainly concentrated on the Morowal, the Sulawes opposite coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggaala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in Donggara in the tsunami, destroying hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the tsunami hit the west of Donggara, killing nine.
Indonesia is a seismicly located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Next, we will bring away the biggest earthquake and tsunami in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the western coast of the province of Acehi in North Sudan triggered tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the shore of Sumatra.
2006: 6,8-degree earthquakes hit Indonesia’s most populated Java island south of the island, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of the province of Lääne-Sumatra, was hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Sumatra Islands - Mentawa Island, firing a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regent Acehi, causing destruction and panic, reminding people of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami destruction.
The tsunami did not occur at that time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombard, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in the cage.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and former Vice-President Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested for the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with the suspicion of domestic violence, the intervention of domestic violence and the provision of resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
The ball will be held at the Mat-Su pre-research facility and will be held for a $500 guarantee bail, KTUU said.
He came to the court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “no fault in any way,” said the news network.
Palin faces three grade A-grade misdemeanours, which means he can be expected to be in front of a year of imprisonment and a fine of $25,000.
He has also been accused of a class B misdemeanour, which is punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking the father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother Sarah Palin called the police.
The case is currently being discussed in the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon, of all this in a drunk state.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
The Veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when he tied his son to the violent behavior of PTSD, which is due to his service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia followed the tsunami: the dead are hundreds
After the earthquake struck by the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday, at least 384 people have died.
7.5-degree earthquake triggered tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not functioning and an increase in the number of deaths is expected in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the suburbs of the city centre of Sulawes, which is located in the churches of Jakarta from the capital of Indonesia.
The social media is broadcast by videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
During the fall of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered to the festival on the shore of the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors in NYC apply for a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, killing eight people. This rare punishment has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack bicycles along the West Side highways in Alam-Manhattan, causing both pedestrians and bicycles on their way in October.
According to the death penalty application in the southern New York City, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious physical injury.
In both cases, it is possible to commit a death penalty on the basis of the case documents.
A few weeks after the attack, federal jurys filed a 22-point charge to Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal crimes, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack expected “a massive planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s activities as “defensive, cruel and gloomy.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alessandro Damian Pagnuccic family and friends,” he said.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
The last death proceedings of the Southern District Court in New York have passed for ten years.
The guilty Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the end result was his life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in 1953 in the Federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple was executed after the execution of the conspiracy to perform the spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War for two years.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, an inflamed worm showed a lack of doubt in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he had told the investigators that he was happy about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to put the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be released in his hospital palace.
In 22-point charges, he has not taken the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defenders, said that they were “very disappointed in the procedural decision”
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty extends the trauma of all those involved,” Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Mr Tory said that the NIGEL FAAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
At the time of today's Tory protest, the Nigerian Farage promised to \"mobilize the people's army\"
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, because one of the members of the Theresa May's own parliament advised themselves to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative minor, said on the march in Birmingham, that the UK would be out by now, if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May is facing a problem in the reconciliation of his deeply divided lines, which were highlighted by the conservatives in favour of remaining, joining his anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers’ plan on track in the midst of Brexit supporters, icers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that they continue to trade with Brussels despite the counter-attack and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and the chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to \"stop Chequers' plan,\"
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
\"In his responsibility, we'd be out by now,\" he said.
Wellingborough said: “I am out of Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers’ plan.
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not compete in World War II in order to be accountable.
We want to create our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: “I hope that British people have changed their minds and want to remain, it is not true,” he said.
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: “I would like to say just one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unfavorable among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unfavorable among our party and our activists who actually walk along the streets and choose at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and listen to
May said: “The prime ministers can keep their jobs if they stick to their promises.
Farage said that politicians at the gathering should be made to feel “hot” when they plan to betray the decision made on the 2016 referendum.
“This is now the question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that “We won’t let it happen.”
He added to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to put our political class, who is at the edge of Brexit betrayal, uncomfortable to feel.
“We will mobilise the population of this country, which gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved independent, local, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the remains marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering held at the city center.
In the hands of activists, the Toors against Brexit were suffocated after the group was created this weekend.
In the Lord of the Liberals, Adonis mocked the conservative for the security issues that became part of the opening of the conference for their party.
“Those are people who say that IT systems can place and take all the technology to Canada and more, for smooth border crossing, for cross-border trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete tail.
There is no such thing as good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering applying for president
According to the US Elizabeth Warren, after the elections in November, he will be seriously considered to be president.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, President Donald Trump's frequent critic, will be nominated by GOP's national representative, Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of the 2016 Trump Massachusetts campaign in November 2016.
It is recommended that he may be against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the Town Hall after Trump was appointed.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that it’s also on the foreground.”
LSU Sims shooting took place
In LA Police Baton Rouge, Saturday, the suspect in the shooting death of the LSU basketballer Wayde Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson's arrest at the ET news conference at 11 a.m. in the morning.
They released a video of Friday shooting, asking for help to identify a man visible on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University in the early morning.
“Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and died behind it,” Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, having a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in their initial composition, an average of 17.4 minutes, sketching 5.6 points and taking 2.9 tables for the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team record gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this moment it became clear that Valtter Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas started a good start and left Hamilton almost bored when he was on the first two occasions defending his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went to a box stop and left the Hamilton group’s back end in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead after the second stop, when Ferrari's leader left the barrier free after the third curve's attempt to protect it with a double click.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back row of the grid and was on the seventh place at the end of his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving the rubber to the finish, and passing from Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally went to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman in my children.
“The team has done a great job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump questioned Senator Diane Feinstein at Saturday's gathering because he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused the Supreme Court's nominate in the sexual harassment of Brittany Kavanaugh.
Speaking of the gathering of Western Virginia, the President did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment showing that people were \"witness, contempt and lies\".
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate for a few days, is that you see angry and angry, wicked, nasty and false people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks that are said to be: “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, “Did you leak the document?”
Oh, no.
I didn't leak...
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, he added with the image of the senator.
In July, Ford sent Feinstein a letter of charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said, “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” he told the Feinstein Committee.
“He asked me to maintain confidentiality and, according to his request, I did it.”
However, his denial did not suit the president who commented at the time of the Saturday assembly: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.
By continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take the power back without choosing the resources.
You see this cruelty and shame. They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to drive over to get power and leadership,” said the President of the Media.
Title: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giantis Patrick Dwyer created two gates against Dundee
Dundee Stars won a re-confirmed meeting with Friday's elite, Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5 : 3.
Giants started the game early with two gates to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took home team to the Viking before Dwyer took Giants back to command.
Francois Bouchard equal Dundee's status before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
This was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men. They came to Belfast on Friday night to win Dundeed at 2:1.
It was the fourth meeting of half of the season, which Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate came at 3:35 in the fourth minute with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the successes four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in the first third grade 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Bownie hit the fifth gate in 15-16 minutes.
Dwyer assured Giants to lead before the first break by hitting his second gate at the end of the first third.
On the home square, players gathered again, and Bouchard put them back on the level, hitting a number of overweights in a minute at 27:37 gates.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the first time leadership at the end of the second third of the game, securing the last third victory in the attack zone of his team.
Giants, who have now lost four out of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from earthquakes.
One Indonesian airline driver was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure a safe flight of hundreds of people.
On Friday, the Great Earthquake hit the island of Sulawes caused the tsunami, after which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom have remained unknown.
The region is surrounded by strong tracers, and many people are trapped under the ruins of Palu in the city.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agungi colleagues fled the evolving air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on the post to ensure, at the same time, that Batik Air flight 6321 was safe to fly.
Then he jumped out of the air tower, thinking it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's press agent Yohannes Sirai confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We made a helicopter to transport him from the Calimantan Balikpapan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it,” added the spokesman.
At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could increase to thousands, and according to the state disaster relief agency, access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesperson, said: “The number of deaths can grow because the bodies of many victims are still under the ruins and have not yet been reached.”
The 6-metre waves destroyed the city of Palu, where mass destruction takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kushuma told Sky News: “Kiirab will bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
All over the small market –
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we can’t tell them what they can find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the state military: “I’m going to ask you to work nights and days to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready for this, CNN said.
At the beginning of this year, Lomboki, the city of Indonesia, was hit by an earthquake where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia Air Niugin said one man was missing after the lagoon crash.
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flying plane, the airline now claims that it was led by a plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia that one man was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn’t find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the details of the traveller, such as the questions concerning his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the air carrier and the US Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon airport.
A few witnesses thought the plane was flying from the airport.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was on a very low plane.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to handle the sinking plane in the water to the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin staff was panicking and screaming and that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and the sailors who worked on the shelter near the sea also helped rescue, using a full-blown boat to bring people to the shore, before the plane poured down about 30 meters of water.
The data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died of air accidents related to air carriers registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor closed the case for a review of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Justice Department, spent several hours as an expert reviewer in the analysis of intelligence data.
He pointed out to the jury how he used mobile phone calls extracts to reboot the movements of the 29-year-old victim Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers at the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis had been with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said that Tellis “delivered because my car was in Nashville,” he said.
Another implication was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before the girl died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after the death of Chambers, in Telli, he deleted the messages, calls and contact information.
“She erased her life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to make a trial on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would go to the jury in the same day.
The High Breed: What is known for hyphop?
Hipphop trio wants to combat negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hyphop has been removed from the beginnings of solving its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of the hiphop and make the conscious hyphop again popular.
The bands like The Fugees and Common have recently gathered popularity in Britain again thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York Babysitter is suing a couple of courts after a racist message.
The New York babysitter complains of a discriminatory dismissal to court after a couple of accidentally received messages from the family, where the mother complained that the babysitter is “ordinarily black.”
Couples deny that they are racists, compared to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his misconception when he found out that their new laser service provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work in 2016.
Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “IIIIIIIII, MUSTANAHALINE,
But instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, an uncomfortable understanding of his Prophet, claimed that his social babysitter, who was an African American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice complains to a couple of courts to get compensation for dismissal, which he wants to receive every day in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same work he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them to see, so to do,” he said to The Post, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.
A couple have rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that ending a relationship with Maurice was a reasonable thing because they feared they could no longer trust him after insulting the girl.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think of.
He's not racist.
“We’re not racists,” the wife told Joel Plasco’s newspaper The Post.
“But would you give your children to keep the person you’ve been rude to even if it was impossible?
Your newborn?
Come on, come on, come on.
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “very difficult in the situation”
\"Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice,” added an investment banker.
Although the case still goes on, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple of social media where they are highly criticized due to their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not interact with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born immediately after the book was adopted, said: “It’s hard to put himself in the shoes of a man who read it for the first time before publication.
It’s very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.
He said that his father, becoming inspired to write a children's book of small toys, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was due to his father's death.
About the Paddington he described as a “very significant member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“She was a very quiet man and was not a proud person,” he said.
“But since Pfgyton was so real for him, it was as if your child achieved something: you’re proud of them, although it’s not your achievement directly.
I think he looked at the success of Paddington in this way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the planets, his daughter was quickly transferred to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked unnecessaryly to save her life.
“They called regularly, to say that their daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperous said.
“Then I got a call from Nadil, who said my daughter would die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, \"Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep beating his heart had started to disappear quietly and he left the body.
He was a little dead before that, and now all the systems started to stop.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what happened.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now buried his daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who did not know anything about his experiences.
“No one knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible sympathy for him on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him.
Embroidery women's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide can work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have wrapped up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13, when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydneys, said that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine.
Despite this, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with his own.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms Davis created these maps to let people know there are people to turn to and talk to, even with their friend.
Don’t shut up – you need to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, with his 15-year-old partner not long after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or was depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas season – when the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
Ms. Humphreys said that the man's death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: \"It's tearing the wound in the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to go on and continue fighting.
If you have difficulty dealing with problems, you can call the Samaritans at 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland), contact jo@samaritans.org or go to the Samaritans website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair while the FBI starts the investigation
“I believed that if we could actually get something that he wanted – a limited time and an extensive study – we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the EESC would “take together” in the middle of the permanent block-season congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their opposition was due to age.
Mid-term elections are only in five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans do not go well as expected, they will be greatly weakened by their intention to become the most wanted man in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in a Senate with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea’s troops is “dealing” under Kim’s government.
South Korea’s legislation has said that the number of North Korea’s troops to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citeing the data of the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 power drinks (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr. Park said the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North-Western rivers have been offered the citizenship of South Korea.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escapes through China, which has the longest national border with North Korea and is easier to overcome than a heavily protected demilitarized area between two Koreas.
China takes power drinks as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to home with force.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally promised to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho the U.S. blamed sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, our state has no security security and in such circumstances we have no agreement to make ourselves unilaterally the first armed,” Mr. Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh \"hysterical\", and said that the man was inappropriate for the Supreme Court judge.
President Nancy Pelosi of the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court judge Bret Kavanaugh as a \"hysterical\", and said the man was temperately impossible to work as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered an opinion on Saturday’s interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I realized inevitably that if a woman had happened in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelos said about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate’s Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time, and he was sometimes spoken.
He also expressly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling for charges against him against the loss of the presidential election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 as an organized “grotescé and co-ordinated reputation” of the hate liberals.
According to Pelos, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man was not a judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was being bullied against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifys himself with their statements and the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
The games remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw him from office if he was confirmed by Kavanaugh if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he doesn’t fit in the court where he works right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court judge in the Columbia District of Appeal.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about decisions against Kavanaugh's possible Affordable Care Act (health law – translator's note) or Roe v. Wade (abort's legal case-law – translator's note) because the man is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not a time when a hysterical curated person could become a judge and wait for us to say that it’s not great,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, months and years of intense anger, and it can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's unusual, or \"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she cried as well as when she became angry, but she developed a method that stood in that when she became angry and cried, she said to someone she was talking to, “You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry.
And he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears are partially accepted as a wasteful output because they are misinterpreted.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early workplaces in most of the men's offices where I found myself inexplicable feeling of being angry when one of the older women – a strict leader I was always afraid of – carried me by a collar and a staircase.
“Don’t ever show them how to cry,” he told me.
\"They don't know you're a mascara.
They think you’re sad and it gives them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, the Tollist Democratic Party Congressman Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart at the male presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart caught up with an extramarital love story on the board of Monkey Business, and the campaign ended, Schroeder thought deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think of being a president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” he told me 30 years later.
“The seven candidates were nominated and the last thing they needed was to join someone else.”
Someone said it was like, \"The snow and the seven thumb boys.\"
Since the campaign was over, he was late to collect money and he promised not to be nominated if he didn’t get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 gave him $250.
“Do they think I’m going to get a promotion,” he said.
When he gave a speech, where he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, the feelings received – the feeling of gratitude to people who supported him, the irritation of the system that made it difficult to turn to voters instead of collecting money and delegates, and the anger against sexualism – he was so won that he had tears of throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder reminded him of the reaction of the press against him.
“I could have thought Kleinex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking about what they write on my gravestone.
\"He cried \"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Useful to Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were cursing, and although the battle is far from over, experts said that the interstate gap between Beijing could be beneficial in the long run.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning shot this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs that concern 200 ml of dollars (150 ml of pounds) by imposing taxes essentially on half of the goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded to the same every time, with the last five to ten percent tariffs at $60 million for American goods.
China has promised the US to respond to the threat, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to be reflected as soon as possible.
Getting back to Washington would mean giving to demands, but worshiping publicly in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s cards go out correctly, the trade war with the US can support China in the long term, reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the other spectators have previously admitted,” said a researcher, Abigail Grace, who focuses on the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Minister of Foreign Affairs said Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the state is ready to volunteer for refugees and asks for more than seven years after the war to rebuild the country.
When speaking with the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation on the territory of the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the normality to restore the destroyed areas of terrorists.
Now there are all the conditions that refugees who left the country could voluntarily return to the country due to terrorism and the day-to-day life and unilateral economic measures.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country still need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help to build the inhabited state.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating France near Le Golf National Golf Course with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on the surface of Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe became the crown again when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team received the 14.5 points to win the United States.
Throughout the tournament, the American star Phil Mickelson was attacked by a brick on the par-3 trail in 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have won the tournament in the current format in 1979: 5 : 0 : 0.
The American Jordan Spiethi, with a result of the 5&4 European team's lowest position, made Thorbjorn Olesen.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was going to have Ian Poulter, who could have been the last player to play Ryder.
Eight of Ryder's cartoon contest veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the 25,5 most won Europeans at the careers of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t keep myself back.
It's been a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It’s about the team’s spirit and I’m glad I could help,” said the emotional Garcia after the victory in Europe.
He's going to give him a toad to co-worker Jon Rahman, who won the US Golf League Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel very proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking up,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France, and now he has a career in Ryder’s cartoons 13 : 21 :3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 major competition titles, leaving Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team had a weekend with finding fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team was disappointed, “I’m proud of guys, they were synics.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
He broke up in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Competition Committee and go ahead.
I love these 12 types and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pick up the hat.
We played better.
New information about waterfall: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Livestock Commission (FWC) shows a decrease in overall flowering algae concentrations in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, there are reports of a lack of flowering in the counties of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, referring to reduced concentrations.
The water walk is about 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The warehouses can be found from the coast of Hillsborough 10 miles (16 km) away, but compared to the previous week, there are fewer places left.
Water walks have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the area of Pinellas has been reported with a medium concentration on the coast or offshore, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough county, a background to high concentrations in Manata County, a background to high concentrations in Sarasota County and an offshore area, a background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, a background to medium concentration in Lee County on the coast and an offshore sea, and a low concentration in Collier County.
Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties will continue to report the irritation of the respiratory tract.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation over the past week in North Florida.
