European inflation fell on food
The rapid inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to a rapid increase in food prices.
The price rise in November was higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, after 2.6% of October, the annual inflation rate was registered, reported by the European Union's Luxembourg statistical office.
The official forecast is only 3 percent probable,” Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base mine, unlike the British and Canadian central bank, saying that the reduction would lead to inflation spirals with rising commodity prices and reduced unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps: “Don’t talk about inflation, so that you don’t have to act on this topic later.
In Germany, the value of inflation in November is 3.3 per cent as a twelve-year record; in Spain it rose to 4.1 per cent.
Eurozone inflation has been increased by rising food and energy prices.
The time-limited wheat notes increased by 88%, and the soya bean exchange rate reached the highest value since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay significantly more for oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world oil market price increased by 52% this year, and last month it has cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent of this year is declining in 2008, but already by 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to the figures, the rate of 12 monthly inflation remains around 3% for the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will have doubled its interest rates in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After the long stagnation of Fidesz's sponsorship, it has grown significantly, so since 2002, it has the largest camp, while Gallup has not measured such a low, 13% socialist support before.
In particular, the difference, due to the greater determination of opposition voters, would be more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support for the support of the MSZP of one fifth (20 percent).
According to the survey, MDF and SDS are below Parliament's threshold: their support in the whole population is two percent.
There are a percentage of supporters of both camps among the Commissioner's voting parties.
The economic expression has further deteriorated to the previous depth – it has never been so high, 41% of those who considered the country’s economic situation to be particularly bad, while the situation is quite bad, according to another 46%.
The change in their own financial situation is now more pessimistic after the spring and summer hopeful prospects.
For the next year, the larger half of the population will be reduced by further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey by Gallup, 71% of the respondents believed that the prime minister was rather ill than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
54% are not trusted at all, 27% in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much society thinks it can be treated without a change of government to dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.
While 35% of the government and the head of government have been willing to stay after last October, this rate is only 20% now, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution.
60 percent of the respondents respond to the question that they would certainly go away and another 20% say they would probably leave.
As a comparison, at a “now Sunday’s national elections,” only 55 percent would be sure to participate and another 15% would be likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be relevant based on the current intentions.
74 to the tuition fees, 79 to the vizitus, 84 percent to the hospital daily fee would say no.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who are sure to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would withdraw the introduction of tuition fees, visa fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive of Auchan, he raised Tesco in almost five.
In the trade triangle in Budapest, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference between the fact that the VAT rate this year did not rise.
Article of the Solar Economy
This year, the usual Christmas basket in Budapest has grown by an average of 16%, but in each hypermarket there has been a much higher growth of over 1,000 forints.
As last December, the prices in food stores have already been \"exploited\", so compared to the previous high base there has been no dramatic fertilisation.
But it is obviously terrifying for consumers that what they received last year under 9,000 forints, they are not getting it for tens of thousands.
The sun’s kosara has crossed the tens of thousands of forints with less than 91 forints in the researched hypermarkets.
The highest level of basketball was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the cart was added to 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost the same as last year, but also the turkey juice, nuts and raspberries have been heavily fertilized.
KSH's data was followed by the price of flour and bread in stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product under 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre reversible bottled Coca-Cola was 200 forints, so only 257 forints were requested with a deposit fee.
However, this year, Auchan showed the most expensive in the solar basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by about 18-18%.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and cheapest baskets, the difference was 12 percent, while between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive, 21 percent is growth.
In Forint, the average increase was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came out to 1206 forints, so that at last Christmas it felt its effect on prices the increase in VAT.
This process was broken down by trade, and apparently it was not possible to decide on how much price to use in one product, because it was impossible to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If you plan the speed of a product wrongly, then you can make a serious profit at the price adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
As a result of the VAT, the price increase in the solar basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive 1720 forints were more than the 2006 value, while only 844 forints were the cheapest.
This year, this extremism did not show itself, as the most expensive 1630 forints were more than last year, and the cheapest one was expensive with 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, the catastrophy increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months, with daily consumption items in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily prove the data of KSH: the statistical office will increase the price by more than 30% over a period of 12 months for some essential foods.
For example, in addition to the flour in the egg.)
According to the Napi kosara, this seems almost impossible in the latter, as the price level of a rather expensive product already produced a price increase of less than 10% compared to the base last year.
Listrators are in a stronger position than the egg owners, and the dramatic price increase on the multi-group has been overcome.
In the gold triangle, hyperes do not complain, they report a good year.
According to our experience, in the three shops we visited, the customer’s bulk is no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantity from everything, they take durable foods on platform.
In the morning of Wednesday, all three stores had a lot of stories before the cash prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic in the countryside is more expensive, and there are several complaints to research companies that even their plans are not only for food, but also for long-term consumer goods.
There are many places in the fertilizers.
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The conditions of hygiene in hospitals, the greasy of beds, the overexploitation of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, says the Head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
There are many places in the fertilizers as well.
Recently, MRSA was diagnosed with traumatology at the John Hospital.
After a serious accident, there was evidence of a bacterial resistance to antibiotics in men.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
A serious car accident injured him was allowed home from the hospital, but shortly later he had to return with MRSA infection, and his major surgery had not been completed since then due to the bacteria in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1094 multi-responsive pathogens have reported hospital infection in the National Nosocomial Survey System, the National Epidemiology Centre’s chief physician Böröcz Karolina said.
This means that many infections caused by multiresponsive pathogens have definitely been registered in hospitals, and the rest is not known.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by a third of people without causing the disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, mandulaitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics, they are well cured.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or inadequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop from the bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly in the event of inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is functioning temporarily or permanently, severe hospital infections in patients with weakened, elderly or small body weight, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, can be caused by septic disease.
According to the doctoral director of the John Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the flight, MRSA is only not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Antibiotics
“We separate such patients, the nursing staff see the patient in rubber cells and masks, and have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but no infection can always be avoided.
No fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be prevented, but current hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-responsive pathogens, Böröcz Karolina claims.
Once this infection occurs typically in hospitals, elderly patients should be monitored by hospitals and patients carrying MRSA should be immediately separated.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, there is no microbiological sampling in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies.
Most cases thus come to light when the patient is infected with MRSA, the epidemiological center’s chief physician said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also national guidelines for the healing of certain infections and pathologies.
It should be sought to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. to conduct microbiological studies, so that there is no resistance to medications, but hospitals do not keep it in any way.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the accompanying patient or basic care, Böröcz Karolina said.
Spórol on fertilizers
Scientific evidence suggests that MRSA is most often transmitted by healthcare staff from one patient to another.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in handwashing, gloves, the use of masks, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA has a drop in infection, contact, but it is not always possible to separate the infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, hospitals are often crowded, often very close to each other, from an epidemic point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, it is also experienced, noted by Böröcz Karolina, that in unfavorable medically hospitalized hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients, so there is a greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there may be less evidence of such infection, or it may be stopped by the extension of the pathogen.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes enormous costs to health insurance providers, so they fight everywhere.
In England, for example, it included a government programme to prevent or reduce the occurrence of MRSA.
Based on the data reported, the program shows a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include multi-responsive pathogens (including MRSA) and prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
There was no drunk police officer who caused a fatal accident.
An official expert opinion has been prepared on the case of a fatal accident caused by the XXII district police officer.
It is forbidden that he would have led his post in a drunk state or in a blocked state, in the meantime, to resign from the 21st district police officer, who had killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, told Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the Capital Office on Friday after the expert opinion on this matter was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the primary test result, which has already found that the former police captain did not consume alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The commander of the 21st district police station with his own car hit the 55-year-old man who didn't want to get to the other side of the road at the designated footing.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian does not pass through the zebra, according to the rules of KRESZ, would otherwise have to give the car driver a priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transporting to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the police officer resigned from his post and asked him to rest, according to the police, because the incident was so shocked.
The case is being examined by the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also found out that the former police officer worked with the prosecutors who were investigating the investigation from the beginning.
Another €400 million infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements were signed with the Minister of Finance of Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, from which 100 million loans were previously concluded by the parties, the contract signed now concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
Education-related projects also provide budgetary funding for the EUR 150 million credit agreement.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, 50 million Euros were signed by the parties, which is primarily used for research and development projects at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the EU’s metro financing, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to John Veres, this may take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan portfolio is provided by the EIB with an 8-year patience and no deposit fees.
Bulgaria is the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe's attention to the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are the EU buying at the cheapest, but fast-deprived market?
Analysis of Re/Max Bulgarian division.
The most popular Eastern European property purchase destination now undoubtedly is Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and coastal houses.
Among the mountains is the most vibrant region of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and Albena, the ‘Aranypart’, the ‘Napospart’, the ancient Sozopol and Neszeb, but more and more are looking for properties in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will pick up the interests of investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will buy it in the very cheap Rusz area.
The capital city, Sofia, is also an attractive option for goat, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European golf clubs, so next to the summer and winter season, it will be the road goal of the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying a lot, such as in Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate in Bulgaria is also sought to change their lifestyle.
Most customers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Malta and Cyprus investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers or refurbished properties are purchased at a price of between €50 and €100 000, or are refurbished old houses for €5-15 thousand, and then refurbished.
It requires good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to a big city, shops and, in general, to the local doctor.
The second category was added to the first 10 German holiday destinations in December (Bulgaria).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The decline of capital properties is constant, as demand is becoming stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices were in the European Union, but in the last five years they increased by 21%.
The rise in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in payments.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister for Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and after the formal opening, the meeting of the ministers will continue with the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from the 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period designated by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a fierce debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although the agreement is going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question of the conference is whether developed countries are committed to reducing emissions, in addition to providing both financial and technological assistance to the affected countries.
There has also been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The fund of support provided by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by the Management Board of 16 members, expected within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), can be read in the Market and Profit.
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Water, Mr Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the creation of a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will commit to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and ready to take up to 30% reduction, in cases where other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibilities and abilities.
Mr Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the total number of countries joining the Kyoto Protocol was 5.2% reduction, including the EU - then 15 Member States - committed a minus 8% reduction.
Hungary's commitment is 6% greenhouse gas emissions reduction compared to the 1985-87 period, which our country will fulfill. - Recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
High bets in Bali, because within two years the long-term international climate policy agreement should be put under construction, otherwise its entry into force would definitely be followed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow the new international emission reduction system, which is necessary in the latest report of the UN Nobel Peace Prize, Climate Change, which was also highlighted by the International Scientific Panel on Climate Change.
This would lead to a delay in emission reductions and would be inevitable to increase the average temperature of the Earth above 2 degrees Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
On YouTube, the British Army is recruiting
The British military units are publishing recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on video distribution with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) first received YouTube: the special developments in Afghanistan have uploaded videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings with a miniature, helmeted camera will be checked on the command of the Air Force's Kandhar operation, and sent to London, where domestics will upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the Internet in this form, and their “channels” have looked at more than 75 grand.
The British Ministry of Defence (Defenceheadquarters) registered in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of National Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi international peacekeeping (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Action in Afghanistan
According to the original intent of the Air Force, he posted the videos for recruiting purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, it is also good to know the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published in this form almost does not cost anything compared to traditional television recruits,” said Gordon Mackenzie, a defence expert, but it undoubtedly carries a few political messages, as it demonstrates the existence of military actions decided by the government in a special form.
The Americans made a game
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, the army also has a problem with the distribution of amateur videos, which, for example, show the death of soldiers: in the slightly picturesque, “official” propaganda films, officers speak of the losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos from Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the Internet, which were made in sharp deployments, but the British army has just recently received it.
The Americans are recruiting a little bit differently, with a free-to-charge American's Army shooting game, where the player can directly hide into the soldiers' skin in the framework of a more or less life-long simulation.
Christmas and Christmas will be at the Ministry.
Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not appear to be emotional: instead of Christmas party, he will hold a year-to-year work experience for his colleagues who will be able to thank him for his time in 2007 with a plagiarism and coffee.
There is a ministry where there will be a live music party, where there will be a Christmas atmosphere elsewhere in the hearts of the officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and coffee table - so fun with power.
Public offices are also ready for Christmas.
The largest standard miniature Christmas party is held this year, but the HM is not waiting for the employees of the Ministry.
On Christmas in the Gardens, the children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions at the Mission Christmas, but they also host press reception.
The wallet takes 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will be fired from the other stores compared to the rest of the world.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, with a total of 4 320 000 forints, and about three hundred and fifty guests from six hundred ministries.
At the festival of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas atmosphere, but they will also take action and take tomboot.
The Christmas of the NFÜ was 4 700 000 forints and was held in the National Justice Council (OIT) building on Wednesday – concerts and dinners.
The room rental cost a million dollars, spent over 400 invitations to the remaining part.
We know that one of the NFÜ’s departments is also official for another Christmas ceremony: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU money.
The building was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at the MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent authority.
You don't need a suit
The OIT building was not only visited by the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of Christmas, arranged the Luca Day Ball on 7 December.
He didn't ask for any money to use the OIT terms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the Minister's greeting and could be danced to live music after dinner.
The question of [origo] was said: the ball was not mandatory at all in the evening dress or suit.
Puritan is a party for health, work and municipal storage.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and a ceremony for 400 000 HUF for workers in its own building.
Lamperth Mónika’s Minister of Labour is officially not waiting for a Christmas party, but for a year’s work experience.
They expect a hundred guests, who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and tea, so the party will be taken out of 350 000 forints.
However, Mr Gordon's Minister of Local Affairs will simply cocint with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large room for 436 employees.
Each guest has 2500 forints for the Christmas party - the amount of a buffet bet and a cocktail fit.
Since John Veres is the minister, the employees of PM have been like Christmas every year.
However, there will be no bourgeois, not only the minister’s speech, but also the afternoon’s time.
On January 20th, the farm store gives a New Year’s Acceptance, the Ministry Christmas is missing.
The bet is held in the Vajdahunyädvár, in the City League, and according to the stock, it takes 1000 forints per hundred guests.
This - according to the press class - will be a very simple standing bet, which only foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual bets start with a short-term welcome and end with a restrained walling.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, reported with [origo] in the relevant press classes.
The price of the office Christmas of the environmental wallet could not be said in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Industrial Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are growing.
On Friday, the National Association of Liga Trade Organisations and Labour Councils will establish their strike committee coordinating the Monday-undeterminate strike.
On Monday, a conference is held on Saturday, and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the termination of work will begin.
The operation will certainly lead to significant congestion in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Trade Organizations will present the details of the Monday strike organised jointly with the National Association of Labour Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will be set up, which will coordinate Monday operations.
On Saturday, the protesting assembly will be held, and from Monday to Monday, the organisations joining the strike will cease to work for an indefinite period of time, unless they can reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been designated, on the day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act, as the date of completion of the strike started.
If the National Assembly would not accept the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted, the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On Monday's agenda, it can be imagined that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in late evenings or at night hours.
Due to the strike that starts on Monday, it can be expected that there will be significant delays in transport: there will be no time at the railways, a part of the public transport in Budapest will stop tomorrow, more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be a semi-road roadblock at several points in the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs joined the strike call, and their list is constantly updated on the League Day.
Some organizations have declared strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared temporary termination.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers (VDSZ) could not agree on a sufficient service, and more and more people travel on railways as close to Christmas holidays.
According to the previous reports, they strike at BKV for 13 hours, between 7 and 9 hours at Budapest Airport, four hours of strike are held by LIGA's Electrical and Heat Trade Organizations, 2 and 2-8 hours of work break-off, and the Democratic Association of Pedagogogians.
The Hungarian Medical Association is planning to strike nationally, in changed times, a two-hour warning strike for workers in the SZEF Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ).
The four demands put forward by the League are most important to bring the government back to the presentation of the reform of health insurance and to give rise to a new concept of social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new retirement method from next year.
The third is to ensure that senior pensioners have access to the system before 2010 for worthy working hours.
The fourth reason for the operation is that the Free Trade Organisation of Rail Workers belonging to the Liga Trade Organisation (VDSZ) does not accept the offer of railway wing lines by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport, and is waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk
The work of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year with the support of Hungary for the Right Hungary, has also increased the political risk of Hungary and the region, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company’s “risk warnings” have been described as the greatest political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Guard, that “in the short term, even violent ethnic conflicts between the Hungarian population and the population of the non-Gigánya in Hungary can develop, even in the short term, through the deepening of existing ethnic tensions.”
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to aim to provoke such an act, the research institute added.
As it has been written, all of this can be traced back to one of the main concerns of Hungarian political actors: “The public debate on Roma affairs has been handed over to the representatives of radical and extreme political groups who could build a political strategy on the anti-Gangány conflict.”
This deepens the problem, uneasys normal dialogue, strengthens extremes and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard under the influence of the great domestic and international media attention have significantly undermined Hungary’s image abroad, particularly the stability of the country and its belief in democratic development.
It is recalled that, as of autumn 2006, more and more public and momentum was received from Hungary’s radical and extreme right groups, it is part of the reorganization that from the summer of 2007, several organisations called “national self-defense” were formed in Hungary.
“The common feature of this concentration is to define themselves as a civilian organization, while the preparation of its members, whether armed, is openly declared to the defence of their defence (terrorist, defence, defence, order protection) tasks, and, referring to the failure of the police, the army, or the state, was added.
It was noted that all of this is done in accordance with the method that, based on the political and parity of society, seeks to put various political aspirations in a civil suit.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association are therefore not only intended to avoid the legal failure of the court entry in the case of these associations, but also to provide a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-boosting factor for neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, there is a potential threat to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring countries, and the ultra-nationalist political actors in certain neighbouring countries want to demonstrate their own anti-Hungarian policy with reference to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union on the extreme right side (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian barrier, there are mass Roma disruptions that broke out in one of Sofia’s quarters (Crasna Poljana).
By taking advantage of this, the BNU decided to establish a barrier, saying that the organization is aimed at ‘national self-defense’.
In the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a \"cigarette terror\" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained improbable and indifferent, reminds the Political Capital.
He added: The initiative has sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that resistance is likely to create their own barrier.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities with the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma, similarly, react to the threat of their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of Political Capital research, said in the interest of the telegram office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue their risk analysis annually, and if they experience something that can affect the change in the risk, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is a red letter of the holiday
In Hungary, the law specifically defines the red letter days, and around the holidays there has become a general practice of working day planning, from which there will be fewer futures.
There is no uniform holiday in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Most of the holidays can be linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We also celebrate the new year: the last and the first days of the year are both holidays – the latter is only in order to get the sylvesters out.
We have a total of eleven red letter holidays all year round.
The national holiday is March 15th and October 23th, 1848 and the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the establishment of the state, the work on 1 May, and we remember our relatives and friends who died on 1 November and 2 November.
In addition, we have a two-day holiday for Easter, your punk and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall for the weekend according to the calendar, working day shift has become practical in cases where we work before or after the red letter celebration for just one day.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we will not stay away from work school on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day before or after the celebration is to be processed is precisely when, for many years, the Minister of Labour has been regulated by a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and workers employed by them, both those employed and those in public service law.
However, it does not affect companies and institutions that operate on working days without interruption.
This year, only the end of the year’s holidays change the work schedule: from 24 December, life stops in the country, as it is experienced that the days between Christmas and sylvester, most of the people are “sliping” or using their saved freedom for this purpose.
There will be more holidays in the middle of the week or the end, so there will be less workday placement than this year.
First, the holiday of work is transformed around the calendar so that workers can stay home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day to be in exchange for Friday 2nd May.
The second move will be linked to the 23 October celebration: on 18 October, it will be necessary to work on Saturday instead of 24 on Friday.
However, the end of the year can take place on the occasion of the celebration next year, as from 24 December, almost everywhere will be a nonstop break even if the Silvester falls on Wednesday.
Six terrible little things that can upset your colleagues.
E-mails that we forget to send are voicemails that we never receive, innocent lies, which we don’t almost notice: they “color” daily at work.
The question is whether you get used to the slight discomforts or pick up the gloves and consciously avoid misunderstanding situations that cause others to be offended.
Tips.
“I forgot to tell you that they were looking for a marketing class,” your colleague said.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make things right, possibly call the marketing class to tell you you you forgot to pass the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing excuses, it is worth thinking about what you can get unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid it.
Are you buying something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching for a piece of paper, office or phone, and it's not anywhere.
Do you remember that you put your lighter on the table yesterday, but it was on foot in the morning?
Maybe you'll find your pen on your colleague's desk?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without questioning, because they will be justly angry with you so that you will vacate their property.
Don’t put in a pocket of office envelopes, mails, because it can be unpleasant if we run out of time, and you’d need it right away.
Are you rumoring about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop already spreading rumors.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don’t touch everyone’s nose on the privacy of your colleagues.
If one of them shares his secrets with you, do not live with his trust.
Do not discuss with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about your colleagues’ affairs.
Are you innocently sick?
When you call in the office and you report a sick person referring to diarrhea, because it is bad for you to get drunk or feel like you'd rather rest that day; think about your work, your lifeless things, your time-limits should be done for you.
Don't stab me with your colleagues.
If you know you're not going into the office the next day, or you might want to come in to something that makes you want to stay home, signal that your colleagues and your boss won't face up to you the next day.
Dutching, Sniffing, Telephone
Did you fall in love with the work, but did you pull out of it?
Did you have an unsolicited ear teacher for a phone call that you wouldn't have heard?
Do not interfere with your colleagues with dudorization, singing, loud conversation (which you continue to do above their heads) or foot boxing, continuous defamation, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they are not immersed in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, nothing else for your forgetfulness.
Don’t refer to any chaos in the office, your loud colleagues.
You know, if you made a mistake, it's a disadvantage for someone else, and you're gonna get rid of the chicken.
Ask him how to make your mistake right, replace the flaw.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Maccakes and slippers: comfortable wear for home, but it's not for the office!
Don't get comfortable with your free time if your job allows you to do it.
Don't be a sniper, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going to the office for everyday clothes - if your job requires you, beautiful, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Flexible with the car in the usual morning plug.
There is something special about the radio: it is a violin sound that is associated with electronic effects.
I'm moving the volume up.
The music has become a pace, and the bass comes next to the former sounds, and then as a real jewelry, the female choir is connected.
Zagar Wings of Love's number is on mr2.
The Hungarian music life has forced us with a high-quality electronic pop for a long time.
But now it seems like there's a whole different plug when you listen to the new Zagar record.
The discovery of Yonderboi, a few new and exciting productions coming from the Hungarian digital underground, slowly change the overall picture, and in vain fashion the guitar-creating garage rock, the domestic electropope also proves: there is new under the sun.
Zéser started from Pécs, and he also played in Yonderboi's band as long as - perhaps, because two boobs didn't fit in a battle - he took his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, but it began to break when filming soundtracks were asked to compromise (e.g.
Ferenc Turkish Season).
At the beginning, the formations of smaller clubs were recognized by a wider audience when the first album of the wan2 magazine was ranked among the 50 most important domestic albums in 2002 and Zagar, a company in Yonderboi, called the almost single, western trend designers.
No doubt, Zagar and the band became “trend,” but no one asked if they would like to wear the label.
The band responded as it should: made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial Pécs years.
This was a series of Zöszer Balazs, one of the old orchestras.
With the airy flying reference we were in place, but, besides the airiness of music, it now appeared, according to the spirit of the age, according to the trend - the effects of the louder guitar, rock and roll.
In these songs, the song was shown by the singer George Ligeti, who is currently working with The Puzzle Orchestra in England.
The album also produced a real radio scooter, which was later created by Mr.2 Petőfi, playing popularian music from the morning to the evening, began to smuggle into the ears of the six Hungarian singer \"Unground Divas\" recorded by Wings of Love.
Everything's okay (?)
Hvg.hu asked Zéser Balazs.
hvg.hu: This new slide now raises the question: how many layers do you play?
Zéser Balazs: The definition of layer music doesn’t mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music cast; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but comedy and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, nothings and can be made for sale, which makes them comedy.
But a good pop can also come from a sincere start.
His intruder attitude also works in his spirit, regardless of language and country limits.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign, mainly from us to the west, have greater traditions of light music.
It is not only the eleventh and twenty-first-year-old classes that go to concerts, but also the older.
More closely monitor the changes in the light music around them, because it is also considered part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it's a good feeling that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not for the sake of us, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can rather be perceived in concerts, where it already works for each other, but this is only reflected in the inconspicuous changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you planning to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works in a solo and rather built his career to the west of us.
Zs.B.: We’re not really on his way, no matter how often they try to explain it to our music.
We are more team players who trust in the presence of the other music and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, because many of us made up of his band and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: On the top list of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was first placed.
Many people first heard the name Zagar.
Are you consciously open to a wider layer with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a slide and then sell it.
This song is more than that.
We were meant for the album's finale, which we tried to solve the sound theory and difficult topics that were done on the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singer?
Why are they - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a violin-like pathology.
Then the idea came to put this choir together from the good speakers of our own music scene.
This is how the six-member choir, that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Boris, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song designed or shaped by girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an instrumental version, and then when the disk material was assembled, we thought that there would be something else to this number.
The time has drawn me to make my song come true.
That night I sang the song that the girls later learned.
It's almost first and scaryly spontaneous.
I remember it was very flashy at the time, but of course, they needed it.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and on the concert seemed to be behind the girls.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short performance), they don't have their own role, they're singing together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was merely because of technical problems.
But it's obvious that we didn't want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little, where it came from, where it goes, just let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which job did most work have?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, there were actually none, rather than mixing, difficult pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a racing piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, and then he was pretty slowly standing at his place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with concerts and the fact that I’ve already allowed the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor’s small-scale feeling risks billions.
It's a terrible scream.
The owner of the Czech Trade Bank, the French Societe Générale banker, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was rather a big player who wanted to catch his colleagues.
Unlike the other banks, the US mortgage market was recognised in time.
“He’s low-temperature,” he said to the police’s seniors.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, it is clear from Kerviel’s testimony that at the end of the last year, he gained a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
Change not only in America
“I just wanted to make money for my bank,” he said in his statement.
In the summer, half a billion euros were found in the US crisis.
The opportunity has already been understood in the beginning of the year.
In February, there have been news that there will be problems with the so-called subprime mortgage for low incomes or customers who have a history of cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and made it a good horse.
The final profit of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I was looking for the first half billion, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel admitted, adding that he didn’t keep anything for himself.
In his statement, he admitted that his reports were counterfeited so that it could not be discovered.
He also managed to trick his boss, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to ask about his transactions.
The risk was profit.
Were you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billions of money for the bank, that it would calm them down.”
Where did you risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
He worked at the Société Générale Bank since 2000 after lyon University.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and his own broker was paid $90,000 a year in 2005.
He knew he would never look as much as others.
“In 2005, I knew they were looking at me with the wrong eye.
Because of my skill, professional and personal development, Kerviel told the detectives.
After his entry into force, the first great success came soon.
Thanks to Allianz’s shares, he was looking for half a billion euros in the London bomb attacks.
And it started a lavina, and he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know about everything, or rather guessed.
“As long as I made money, I lost my eyes.
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to bury me in the middle of a weekend in mid-January.
When he went to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
Because of his freedom, he became suspicious.
“I only took four days in the last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic is likely to acquire 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can acquire 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroons) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
There are about 125 billion crowns in seven operational programmes in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion crowns, is aimed at transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating programme and 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed next year by a crown of 9.8 billion.
The Business and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win innovation tools.
Companies should also acquire funds to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries within the framework of the new EU funds.
The court approved the 20-year prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the National Court of Appeal approved 20 years of prison sentence for Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, to whom it was sentenced in 2003 for the financial fraud of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and was imprisoned in his country near the capital.
Whether the former leader of the Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be back behind bars, according to the AP News Agency, it is not clear yet.
President of the Court of Appeal, Ilena Perez, said it will depend on the prison leadership to leave Alemaan's punishment at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that government funds were regularly referred to by foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their accounts were in reality related to their relatives and nearest supporters.
He then conducted some of these funds at the Foundation, which was founded to finance the election campaign of Alemán in 2001.
We have approved our budget
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
Why is this budget special?
This is the first budget adopted by the coalition majority by this government without the support of the opposition.
This year, he passed with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were not allowed to accept it.
No drama has happened this time, unlike the debate on the infidelity of the government before the vote.
The House of Representatives has generally ignored this, although the most influential law.
It's a certain contradiction.
Each government begins and ends at some chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the forces of the government and opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
Debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the former social democratic governments were confronted with three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget is unable to solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of compulsory, so-called \"responsibility\" legislation, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year are approved by ČSSD and KSČM's silent coalition, before elections.
The second is the result of the first deficiency of the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the budgets of cities and flights.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This is under public and relatively control.
Timed bombs are the budget deficits of cities and flights.
Many mayors would also be able to make money from taxes, taxes, and bank loans for other investments, and often issued bonds with which their towns were disproportionately sold.
In recent years, this debt has been abolished by the large sale of the shares of the energy and other distribution networks received from the State from the privatizations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a period of growth similar to the rest of the world for a few years, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to order public funding.
Instead, the country was increasingly in debt.
The rest of the countries were managed with one of two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, the Czech Republic in a much more reasonable way.
This is primarily the huge shame of previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least at risk of poverty in global terms.
For example, there is no need for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been completely unnecessary in recent years.
Although this year, it has been possible to eliminate the part of the illegitimate populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no retirement and pension reform in the near future, any policy will actually end in this country, and whoever governs it, it will only be officialisation.
With a little overage it can be said that the majority of the funds taxed from the governor’s politicians are generally retired and that social benefits become their mechanical distributions.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the reduction of ordinary expenditure by the administrator's expenditure.
The 70 billion deficits planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the previous governments had failed to capture everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to get officials out of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and wish peace to prepare for further reform laws, this is not too strong, it is well-known for the coalition government that the state can only get out of taxes and duties.
Only these allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the UK, Switzerland and the central banks of Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
Money markets cost more than $100 billion through stock exchanges.
This stock exchange increases the interest rate on the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed releases $40 billion to the stock exchange and makes it available to the European and Swiss central bank.
After the attacks of the eleventh September, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” said Bernard Baumohl, a consultant from Economic Outlook Group.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to about fifty percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in the United States due to loans that have not been repaid.
The myths expect further billions of losses.
“The central banks may indeed fear what might happen if they decided to do such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves are difficult to access loans, they will also lend loans to their customers more expensive.
This would reduce the need and the U.S. economy with the potential consequences of economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks then decided that the so-called LIBOR, a reduction in the interbank interest rate used to borrow money on the interbank market, was not achieved.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
“It will have a similar effect to this further reduction in interest,” said Greg Salvaggio to the Reuters news agency at Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the step of central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the basic problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change threatens the most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus said again about the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book Blue presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made the debate of the ecologicalists incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality accompanying it.
“The debate there absolutely excludes the structure, it’s just literally throwing, which is a substitute for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for his topic, which is why he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that the book is also published in German translation, as he said, “I often only meet with the caricatures of my opinion,” he said.
Now the interested ones can read their unharmed opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he believed he had enough ground to write such a book.
Because of the ability to monitor and evaluate professional meetings as a academic experience in statistics and economists.
As a testament to the completion of the book, climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and there is no equivalent opinion as to the warming of the planet, all scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too big and serious, so there is no danger, and the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, the use of unconfirmed opinions to others is unacceptable, which is perceived as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that “the environment is not against reasonable protection, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two snow days ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people could not exchange their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old license in time, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time you can ask for an exchange, so that the offices can set up a new licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will start on the road without valid rights.
According to the offices, the license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the attacks represent a fierce fall of interest in the exchange of rights, capital offices have been flooded with requests for legal exchanges for which interest has increased this week.
The General Mayor’s Office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It has to be about half an hour.
In Prague, the license was not replaced by more than 140,000 drivers.
The exhibition of a new license takes twenty days.
However, the new licence may be required by a five-day shortened deadline.
However, in such a case, the driver has to pay an extra 500 crowns.
Drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory transfer of rights by the end of the year and will start their journey with an invalid legal basis will be at risk of punishment from January.
The guilty must pay up to 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also settle the gap through an agreement.
In the case of administrative extermination, the penalty is 2500 crowns.
Based on previous information from the city hall, you can also receive a fine that is not going anywhere.
You can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry previously called on the agencies to be negligent and to impose fines of up to a maximum of 1,000 crowns.
However, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, says that tens of thousands of fines are no threat to anyone.
He said that the license is a document in which people can decide whether or not.
This is not a ID card that should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should be told off the license.
Enough to take it or recommend to send it to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually replace the other types of licenses.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can exchange for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment of Bedycchel-collective detectives
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík were policemen who were suspected of joining David Berdych's crime association, received thirteen and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of Prague has decided on a final basis, which has reduced their penalties for one of them two years.
The Pyongy Organization was originally threatened by a 14 and 12-year-old prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, and a review can only be requested at the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, it is only waiting for the first instance judgment.
In other procedures, more than 16 years have been punished.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court first found 19 people guilty of robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court today discussed 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants rejected the accusations from the beginning of the investigation by rejecting speculation.
According to the mid-Czech Senate, police members, outside Berdychel, were seen with information from police sources, covered each robbery attack, and helped the band avoid being involved in criminal prosecution.
The band therefore gave up 30% of the robbery to Opava and Koňaří.
It is about the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, it is a robbery that victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the powers of public servants and non-authorised arms.
Because the police found illegally held guns in the House Research, steel core ammunition, laser direction or machine gun.
The gang was accused of taking tens of millions of crowns with the robbery.
In this case, a band of twenty members has already been recognized as legally guilty of other kidnappings of Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment will testify to the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first stage trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial arrest in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on their release for criminal proceedings to the Czech Republic.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
For the children who have been replaced by birth, Igor Veleba requires 12 million crowns of pain and extra court expenses from the hospital in Třebíč.
For mothers, three million each, two million for fathers and one million for children.
As a parent, the hospital offers up to 20,000.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostal Veleba, essentially disagrees.
“We reject this claim because it’s too much,” Dostal said after today’s trial.
“In order to make an opinion on the opposition, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We will find out if there is any value to be used.
But we maintain our view that this will be measurable to all in hundreds of thousands,” Dostal said.
He said the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns until they raised their own biological daughter.
Venice served as the basis for the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the University Hospital of Prague.
Children’s parents, psychologist and psychiatrist experts, said they suffered various degrees of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they had met with such an eyeburn that they did not stop the newborn exchange.
Women are worse off with the actuality of the experienced trauma and the content of what is happening now.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses on 9 December in třebíč.
Last week, children returned to their blood parents - Nikola Čermák to Přibyslavic, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jabloňov.
Vysočina’s driver, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered ten0,000 crowns to families at the end of October to replace them, resulting from the flaws of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is controlled by the tour.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory liability insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must enter the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they may request the help of the founder.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for people, the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crown tables.
Polikka lost the Kingdom of Vülsko
Bolek Polikka lost the case for the title of the Kingdom of Vélsko.
According to the court judge of the Ostravai, although he first used the name of the King of Valach, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, who collaborated with color.
The police didn't participate in the trial today.
However, according to the legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the customer will appeal.
“The debate is that Mr. Harbiš and his team live on Bolek Polivika’s popularity,” said Polivika’s lawyer after the lawsuit.
He said that in the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, everyone is an actor and come to mind.
This opinion is also shared by Harabish.
“There are nearly ten years of work behind us.
Search for money and action,” he said.
He said the reason for the debate is money.
“In years, they realized that the project was successful and could win something from it.
They want to live from our work,” he added.
Future business
According to the court, the name of the King of Valach was first used in his television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At that time, however, it did not depend on the purpose of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harbiš came up with the idea of issuing latach passports.
The original student cinema operation was formed into a business and profitable entrepreneurship activity, which was then based on the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Váhsko.
In 1997, by indicating the agreed name and signature of Polivika in passports, and even by visiting the farm and theatre lectures of their owners.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harbiš only used the idea, which Polízka made public in the Manesz for his business.
“The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the Valach Kingdom project,” the judge said.
However, he added that the project’s soul was Harbiš and his team.
The co-operation of today’s competing parties continued until 2000 when Harabish’s Polágka organized an official crowning in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polivelka and Harbiš have been accumulated, which “for all time elected King Boleslav” to rescue him.
At Harbiš's initiative, he took over Jarmila Šulákova as a mother queen.
In 2002, Polítka Haribish and his associates filed a court appeal against him, which the court today rejected.
The battle planned by Harbiš could bring light to the debate for the throne and for the half of the Queen.
It should be a new king from this fight.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the date.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
This should be something like the Slovacko King's Process.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polivika can also speak quietly,” Harbiš added.
Test 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: missing prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
Its characteristics are nothing special, the quality of change, leadership and production can often be referred to as the average.
But the already present successor on the market, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the comet, called SW, goes a bit further, so there's nothing left for me to think more about.
When I tested Peugeot’s 207 classic hackback, I complained, for example, at the back seat of the head.
This time, the complaint is over, because the karossy of the Kombi means that in this regard, the two-meter-high giants are no longer suffering.
Fürgen in the World
I'll get through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It is a very successful design where I have my sole objection to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate more designers’ inventory if the car’s appearance was so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the arms.
Side driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the carosyria.
In the combia, the head disappears from the few places that have already been mentioned.
I'll put you in the trunk.
The most important part of this vehicle is the package.
This is very well available (including thanks to the running rear window) and should be assessed as a wide range.
They are equipped with empty spaces, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be scattered, and they can handle harder objects.
But let's stay at the volume.
Based on these tables, the fund is organized by 428 l, which is rather an average value compared to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after car of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the mlada boleslav, we will find that Peugeot is well behind a lot of 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or for a baby stroll, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost straight floor after the second line of backs or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
The vehicle we tested was fitted with a 1.6 l, 88 kW power four-wheeled, foreign-fired engine.
And the truth is, so you should look at the thousands of thousands of thousands that drive the family hackback.
Quiet, small and mainly pull.
If we compare it to Škoda’s fit, which often affects me as if they had locked a rag in his exhaust, then I can only enjoy it.
The Price
Car prices are not cheap.
We must remember, however, that we tested a large interior and a very good motor-powered car.
The car will go for 329 900 Kč with a four-wheeled foreign motor.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is already a lot.
The Premium equipment tested throws the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Only that we still have development bags, automatic climate, automatic window wipers, rear windows were electrical remote control....
That means the car will cost 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but calculate the additional equipment of Fabia and get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a decision by the brand.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local school affairs.
Integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of domestic residents have been raped.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well reflected in a case in the North East where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
The differences between students, the ties, are characterized by the relationships of parents.
The situation was that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who said she was a ten-year-old student.
The sinner defends the boy from insulting him with racist sparks.
The police had to go after two twelve-year-old girls attacking Slovak immigrants.
The girls said the man was strangled with racist remarks and thrown with stones.
“When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and nails, and then discovered his naked back,” the mother of Slovak students wrote the next unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents classified disputes on migrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that in British schools the mood between locals and immigrants is getting tense.
In Great Britain, there are 70 thousand jobs looking for Slovaks.
About 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is the island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be complete if you have the right answer.
The golden and white coasts, high waves, or sea, are calm like a halasto.
Pálmafák and all inclusive with cellars offering pizzeria, ice cream or mammoth cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
However, you can find much more on an island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antills.
During the Spanish, Cuba had a statue of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure store and a transfer chain that the Spanish kidnapped and transported to Europe.
The American era followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chief executives of the U.S. mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (mostly a sensation), was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
They were among their guests, for example
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, the tower houses were built, and in the broad rays, cars became a symbol of the culture of the 50s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
Bodeguita del Medio’s walls are decorated with the signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
What about today?
You can also supply the Bodeguita wall in Havana with your stamp.
A cocktail according to the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel is mixed with you.
And the culture cars of the 50s go on to this day in Havana, because once exported chips and sons have been rotting in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana is significantly rested, there is no such beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the area.
Other places are more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much money, development of the green road has been achieved.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguin and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is still offering a unique nuance in the world, which is primarily valued by train enthusiasts.
From their extended plantings, sugar cane was transported to the sugar plant by steam and motor trains.
Their motorcycle was not renewed for decades, so there are machines that can only be seen in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of the most well-known sites are not avoided by Cuba’s visitors.
It is not necessary to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we just remember that there is a museum on the Hemingway Islands mentioned earlier, and who loves the writer, he doesn't want to miss the visit to this museum.
Viňales Valley is one of the most colorful parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The poor vegetation grows from the massacre.
As wet formations, wet hills and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and the soil that is fertile in its stems, it is the result of which a dense plant is covered by a dense plant that has also been scattered.
The valley is a place where the best-quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final form, you can meet at the time of a visit to a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting to see the episode of Major Zeman's Chilean.
Trinidad
The ancient city, which was founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spanish islands.
The slave and sugar trade has brought fame and glory.
The economy is the body in the beauty and monumentality of the city.
The Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad is such a misconception between the Escambray plane and the sea that even in the 50s of the past century they were not there, which would have linked this region to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to stay outside.
There was nothing built there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy that there was a roof above his head.
If a man has more than a afternoon to Trinidad, it is worth looking at the interesting places in the area than the beach of Playa Ancón or the valley of Cucor factories.
And tonight, it's okay to go to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are considered the most beautiful city.
This opinion must have been influenced by the way itself.
Both of the roads from Guantanamon must overcome high and structured mountains, leading to almost barely affected nature by human activity.
The eastern language of Cuba, thanks to its untouched nature, has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
This is where the best chocolate is made, in the church there is the cross of Columbus (in reality, a hundred years after the shipping of Colombia) and the hill where the former castle was standing and today the El Castillo hotel is located, some of which are best known for El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plane, Disno Bay and Island of Isla de Pinos, Tropicana cabaret, the Caridad del Cobra Cuban patron saint, Santeria, African religion, which the successors of former slaves can write about.
The way they say it right, it's better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, according to Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment also affect the course of the United States' mission in Afghanistan.
Minister of Defence Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
Afghanistan's mission does not take place according to the idea, and the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, have agreed to have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries also negotiate further plans and coordination of allies.
While, with the involvement of US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO troops have been called for greater activity this week, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid as a priority.
“Afghanistan development can be touched, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other enables the population to start further development of the economy and security,” said British Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is reported to be the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27% compared to last year, and 60% in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO has about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one-quarter in southern areas.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of teams.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically asked to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think about concrete goals for the future and methods of achieving them,” Gates.
He spoke in the same spirit today, the Secretary-General of NATO.
“I’m not happy about what’s going on in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told the Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day talk with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Passive
In recent months, there are also discussions between the participating countries about whether all allies offer maximum levels in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for Passive.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least of the violence and the fight demands were so high on them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,” Gates said.
This week, Sun called German soldiers lazy.
“The Afghan Suns were featured: The Germans play while our sons fight,” Sun wrote in a material supplemented by the photo of the German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German Bild was attacked and published a photo of the roosters in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt reached one billion in 2009
All Czechs have 84.000 crowns of state debt.
By the end of September, the total debt reached 842.7 billion kroons.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroons.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by a crown of 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The government debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion kroons by the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it rose with a crown of 40.2 billion.
However, June fell by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has demonstrated today the state debt data from the beginning of October.
All Czechs have more debt than 84.000 crowns.
Last year, the state has paid more than 11 billion crowns.
“It seems to me that thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we can only go beyond the one billion crown limit in 2009.
The next year, debt will be around 900 billion and a billion crown,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek, the iHNed.cz server.
Similar to the Next Finance Analyst, Vladimir Pikora: “In 2009, we can go through the transition of a billion.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget unknown.
If it were proven that the situation in the area of politics would change, politicians would be prepared to save more, this could be the case until 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Growing Debts
Government debt is made up of debts of the central government, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by currency bonds, public loan bonds, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
This year, the state’s internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has grown by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
By the end of September, the so-called public debt was reduced by 803,3 billion kroons and by 13.7 billion kroons from June.
The average debt rate increased by 6.5 years.
“The debt between the whole year rose by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is really much more than the economy’s progress.
It is interesting that the increase is primarily generated in loan bonds, where the rise is 20%.
The bad thing is that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will be due to trade if the pension reform comes here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
It is clear from its strategy for financing and the 2007 state debt management that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan with a crown of 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach the 76 billion crown instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crown this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidated Agency planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kroons, ten billion reserves for pensions, 43 billion kroons for public loans and 1.8 billion kroon loans from the European Investment Bank.
Today, the teacher appears in front of a charismatic court because of the name given to a gunman.
On Thursday night, a Catholic court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country because of the violation of Islam, he said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six to seven-year-old students to call a plus mask called Mohammed. However, Islam religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such action can be punished by a bourgeois.
The 54-year-old British woman who was a teacher at Unity High School in Kartúmi was arrested on Sunday at her own apartment. Based on the 125th paragraph of the Sudanese Criminal Code, Islam was accused of violating and rebelling, after the students’ parents complained several times at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's püssmack.
“The children proposed a total of eight names: including the Hassaan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” says Robert Boulos.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohammed's first name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but it is also a very common cross name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary with the picture of the mask and the inscription “My name is Mohamed.”
The problem is that the representation of the Prophet is the violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague at the same school, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious beliefs. He only said: “I’m sorry that he voted with children.”
Many of the students of the teacher agree with this opinion. We believe the teacher is “very well treated with children” and “even if he doesn’t speak of religion in the class.”
Remember that the second most popular Christian name in the Great Britain and 14 different ways of writing exist in English.
This Muslim family is so often chosen by a Christian name as one of the ways to express respect for the Prophet. (This name is given by the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna conference in Wednesday.
The final result: failure.
The talks between Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo on the future status of the Separatist province ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It is regrettable that the parties did not reach an agreement on the status quo,” said Wolfgang Ischinger’s EU diploma at a Vienna press conference.
The U.S. Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region would be at a “season of peace” and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
“In the near future, it is not necessary to avoid violence, but it is a very difficult period,” he added, stressing the existence of obvious tensions.
The broadcast ends on 10 December
On Monday, he will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time, including the European Union, the United States and Russia.
In 90% of Albanians, the future of the province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko submits his report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN had re-trusted the troika in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation task to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, will continue to negotiate after the deadline has expired.
“Russia was committed and remains a negotiated solution, in addition to compromise,” Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
Once Kosovo has been under the control of the United Nations for 8 years, Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“We have not been able to reach an agreement,” said the president of the Kosovo independent province, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Badeni hotel, where we have been on Monday’s “the last chance negotiations”
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of the autonomy of Belgrade would be the continuation of the past in murder and deportation.
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that the compromise was still possible, and the Kosovo Albanian majority warned about the consequences of the unilateral cry of independence.
Belgrade’s “domino effect” still stands in the unstable region because of the wars of independence of the nineties.
“This does not exclude the possibility of compromise for Serbia,” said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again said that the decision should only be to the Security Council, where the Russian ally has a veto right.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will be the last word.”
“For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostonica.
“The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that “the last word will be the parliament of Kosovo,” he added.
Bush is calling for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas agreed to negotiate immediately in order to finalize the 60-year debate between their peoples.
Bush promised in the presence of the two presidents to support them in all possible ways in order to sign the peace treaty in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to cut off the \"terrorist networks\" and Israel must abandon its colonizing activities, and Bush reminded the two parties of their obligations with regard to the \"béke-ütter\" plan adopted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that the objective of negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, was to sign a peace treaty with which all pending problems, including central issues.
The latter concern the three delicate problems of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of the present Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the US President, maintained that future negotiations should be “global and profound” and address all areas of regulation, such as Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security.
Then, Olmert, who came to the summit, promised that future negotiations would be \"directed and continuous,\" and he would strive to \"end in 2008\".
By the end of 2008, Bush established the implementation of the waters of the two states of Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia said it was promised from Bush before he decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (the one whose participation in Annapolis as a success) initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries that guarantees peace for Israel if it withdraws from all Arab territories in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a response to the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem in the root, and focuses on central issues,” says the Saudi Prince in an interview with the Arab daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia.
The prosecutor says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual, it is common to be on such news, the official position and the speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the national police (IGPN) on Sunday, after a few minutes of 17 hours a police car went on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
“The car was parked, so it wasn’t in action. It was 40-50 km/hour at speed, without snoring,” we found out from the police source.
The two without helmets at “high speeds” were driven by a green, “not in the official register, so it cannot be used on the road – (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
“By not complying with the right hand rule, the engine struck the left side of the police car,” a police officer said.
The results of the alcohol test on the vehicle’s passengers were negative.
It shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car is rubbed, the windshield in the form of the star, and the bumper fell.
Mr. Pontois's attorney, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said in an extraordinary statement yesterday, that IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate had been entrusted with the investigation launched because of the failure to kill and help him.
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed on Sunday night confirmed the police report that the rapper arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.
On the day of yesterday, from a strip, which was undoubtedly drawn by the strollers on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles collapsed and went together for a while until the police car failed to cover.
Vehicles have been booked for technical inspection purposes.
On the bodies of the two victims, the medical examination was carried out yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, the speech spread as a running fire in Villiers-le-Bel, saying the police quickly left the site without helping the two young people.
In this regard, IGPN is careful to say, but it is not clear that the police have committed “any serious mistake.”
“This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution in this process,” he said.
Liberation met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your apartment is right at the location.
“With my cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to relive them,” the witness said.
“We couldn’t do anything.”
Then he noticed “a police officer who was completely disturbed and shocked.
The other two tried to relive one of the young people, and the fourth called.
The tension among the present people has increased, as the hopeless situation of the two young people has become evident, so the incoming policemen carried their colleagues from the site by car.
We also know from the witness that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after leaving the police.
They also used a heart massage, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help young people.
The young people did get help.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Growing in tension in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first protests that were introduced two days earlier by General Musarraf.
According to the witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, about two thousand lawyers were wounded from the tear-gas bombs used by the police in the event of emergency measures.
In response, they dumped the police with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
More people were produced.
In your Islam, lawyers registered by the Supreme Court called for a general strike, and protests were filed for arresting about 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers on weekends.
On Monday morning, streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several protests in Multan and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the great Agahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which is uniting religious parties, has also supported the movement of lawyers. The leader-in-chief urged the people to send flowers to judges who do not agree with the need-made, and the trash to those who swore before Musarraf.
\"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid.\"
The Supreme Court in Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, the Court should declare the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf with an indirect vote of 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been moved from his office and has been replaced.
“All we witness is illegal, ill-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s decisions,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he will leave the army to fulfil the role of the civilian president, after the introduction of the state of emergency, said on Monday, Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azem.
Musarraf had to choose from the military uniform until the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Minister of Information also confirmed the news on the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government, by the way, categorized the country-wide speech that President Musarraf had appointed a forced residence as a general.
More than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third of pregnancy (36%) is not planned - it is revealed from the study of the French National Demographic Institute (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act that liberalizes contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that various contraceptive methods, such as tablet or beespiral, are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, the Institute says that the liberalisation of contraception has made birth control more effective – the study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but now this rate is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancys are planned.
Each fifth is designed with a few months of precision, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season to receive the child.
Visual repair at the space station
Scott Parazynski's astronaut and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular improvement of the ship's scientific activities.
This dangerous space pattern proved to be a record in several ways: the repair lasted for a very long time, very little time for planning, and the housing modules had to be carried out by astronauts with “barked” tools.
The problem came out on Tuesday, when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see the embedded part).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
But you need to take care of your power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, that with the help of the 17.5 tonnes solar panels, one module that produced electric currents, which was already on ISS, was to be moved to its final place.
Then the crew started opening the wide solar panels of the module 76 meters.
In this case, one of the harmoniously foldable tables was damaged by a single cable in length of about 1 metre.
In order to avoid further damage, the table was not opened.
The task of astronauts was initially to take a tour of Discovery space shuttle and to repair another missing solar board. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repair the damaged solar board.
Scott Parazynskire had a choice to perform the scene on a 30-meter robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He is one of NASA’s best “space walkers”
High, strong, extremely competent, muscular in the upper body and long arm.
The 46-year-old, doctor-trained man had to “opulate the “morning” solar board.
After thoroughly measuring the damage caused, he cut the wrong cable and fixed the damaged area with some, some of them.
He also helped another “space walker,” who remained near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
The tool used by him, a mini hockey robot that was seen by the insulation of hundreds of volts of solar panels, the spaceships of the station were fused and “cracked.”
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates fully opened the table and then packed his tools and returned to the station.
In the afternoon, astronauts held a half-day rest, and today, seven years later, the Discovery Space Chloride returned to start their return to Wednesday.
The EADS share exchange rate
The exchange rate of EADS shares fell greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that manufactured aircraft and defence equipment announced that the delay in the development of A400M will result in an extra cost of €1.2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21,96 after a 4% reduction.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is why it is likely that the aircraft will be delivered later.
The delay in the transfer of the fighter aircraft reported in October will cost between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, with more than 1 billion affected by Airbus,\" said the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of this expenditure, EADS will have to report new design figures on its 2007 operating results on Thursday, when it announces quarterly results, the company added but did not provide additional figures.
The Group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’s operating performance decreased by 86%, mainly due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also put a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Stay a status quo
There is no big surprise in the Sunday election: the large majority of Russians to the Head of State of Putin will vote on the Single Russia.
In this regard, Russia’s need for self-government is shown after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Vladimir Putin, Russian Head of State, speaks through public service channels to electors already recorded, but their content is still secret.
Putin will lead the Kremlin Support Party, the Single Russian Candidate List, which is expected to win a devastating victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Prime Minister's behavior did not betray anything: he was only a new extermination against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic in the campaign.
“We know what the price for true democracy is, so we want honest, absolute transparent and open elections, without any violation,” he added.
The opposition, however, says that this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, according to which they put pressure on the electors.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gen. Zjuganov, claims that “there was no such dirty choice in Russia in the time of Jelcin.
After the fall of last weekend protests, the former chess champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized protest, and his lawyer said he could not be visited.
“The Russians are still thinking as a “homo pancake.”
The expected election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the Head of State?
The first round of the presidential election was published in the Official Journal yesterday, which will be March 2, 2008 and candidates will be able to indicate their intention of departure by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate is no longer extended.
There is no other successor on the horizon.
What role does Putin play from March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leading party of the Almighty Single Russian Party and the majority of the parliament?
No matter what happens, the outgoing power will win in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's already a leaveover.
“The Russians are still thinking of the way of “homo leveticus”: they don’t feel they can control their fate,” says Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Lavada center.
According to the theory that the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, the development of civil society is delayed.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putyin went back to the Paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. It is more than that, because this new kind of pastorism was not a intimidation, but was associated with certain economic well-being,” Maria Lipman, co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians reject personal responsibility, which was quickly demonstrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
“Why should we think”
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Single Russia are led by 65 governors, who are from the leaders of the 85 Russian region.
The freedom imported from the West often embodys chaos, as it happened in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cserednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher, said: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so we should replace them.
Emerging memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of polls in Bad Arolsen in the province of Hessen, have so far been researchable for the purpose of \"humanity\", i.e. they only provided a unique and name-specific insight for the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the Convention, the archive was opened on the day of yesterday.
Trusted information
Opening the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to carry out research – the transfer of prisoners, the residents of the camps and the health status of forced workers – explains Reto Meistern, Director of the International Committee for the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of the documents, as they contain their names and thus contain confidential information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to investigate civilians who were deported or forced to work on these grounds and to provide evidence of their intervention, which could be compensated for.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider it of great importance to open the Bad Arolsen archive.
“These documents essentially contain nothing new,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the research centre on anti-Semitism at the University of Technology in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching €60 billion at an annual level.
The EU’s number one trading partner in India and gives 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope that they will be able to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, said Peter Mandelson, European Trade Commissioner and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers have already approved last April to launch negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of intra-European bilateral trade is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU’s number one trading partner in India and gives 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India's largest foreign investor, but India is the 9th most important trading partner of the EU, according to the European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that “a free trade agreement for both parties can have an economic impact, and “India could thus increase its presence in a 450 million residential florist market.”
The ten most important products exported by India are Europe’s primary or secondary importer. At the same time, the two giants, Europe and Asia have expressed a value of €47 billion each year – and a service of €10 billion – a replacement for each other – in Danièle Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, announced that the bilateral trade “has not always achieved its full potential – the EU and India will meet in New Delhi in the framework of the eighth diplomatic summit, which will be attended by the Prime Minister of Manmohan Sing and José Manuel Durao Barroso, the President of the European Commission.

Answer to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the money market for five weeks of running time
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the unrest of credit conditions, so on Thursday, it announced that it would pump 10 billion English pounds into the money market, which would be available with a HUF 5.55% base and, unlike usual, five weeks of running time.
“We want to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered in the international financial market from 6 December to a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in the press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December, at 12:15 a.m. on local time. The offer will be valid for the central bank base and the repayment deadline will take place on 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The running of such operations is usually a week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that ‘to take further measures to ensure that interbank loans are adapted to the central bank’s basics.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it is currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest rate on the amounts invested in the money market, which has delayed the banks from receiving them.
According to the statement, many of the resources offered by the European Central Bank (European Central Bank) (which only confirms the evolution of the price of the font compared to the euro) would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank for which they could have received more favourable interest rates and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on consumer power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre Group closed on Thursday the discussion of articles of the Socialist Proposal on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text negotiated at the meeting initiated by the socialists contained about ten measures adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday. These included, for example, an increase of 50% in employment, the restoration of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of the travel check and the restriction of rents.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the review of articles, the meeting of the government party and opposition at times ended with a sharp talk of speech, which took place only a few hours before President Sarkozy’s speech on consumer power.
The Head of the Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that all his group's proposals would be resubmitted in the context of the amendment of the draft corrective financial law, which will take place next week on the agenda of the National Assembly.
The new festival is born
A number of discussions were held about the new Phidelphian Music Festival organised by the C3 Presses. However, the event-organizing and popularizing company announced that Melvin Benn will be held in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn, the Festival Republic in New Jersey at the Vineland Music Festival.
“It’s an honor for us to work with a man who is the starter of today’s American festival movement,” said Billboard.com, Charlie Jones from C3.
The C3 also organizes the Lolapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to ride.
The festival will be held between August 8 and 10 in a private area of about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s greatest honors festival organizers.
In 1989, he started organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn extended his palette with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic invited the Latitude Festival to life in the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival’s production, licensing and organisation tasks. This festival is now able to accommodate up to 177 500 people.
The C3 co-worker, Charlie Jones, called Glastonbury Festival, called the \"leginspirative event\", which he had ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn were working in parallel to enriching the region with a European-style festival.
“We have chosen the Philadelphia site before, and we have worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organise this festival in the centre of Philadelphia,” Charlie Jones said.
“We have continued to work with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, due to the political maneuvers of city management, the organization failed,” Charlie Jones continued.
“We were able to talk to Melvin Benn on the contrary, and now we are preparing to organize a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the inhabitants of Philadelphia.
The C3 Presses brought the Lollapalooza festival back to life in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after demonstrating his exceptional festival talent with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The total revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and $11.3 million.
Both festivals were held at city sites.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating a European rural atmosphere and a urban feeling of living in the Americas.
Vineland is located between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s population, and even the mayor himself, is eager to support the event,” Charlie Jones said.
Although he doesn’t talk about the details of the agreement, he says, “the conditions are good enough to allow investment in such a event at a site that hopefully gives home to the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “great-sized,” and its reception capacity is approximately equivalent to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The groups have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will be basically a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music offerings to make everyone feel good about it,” Charlie Jones said.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together with the C3 company, received the award of the “best independent event organizer” by Billboard Touring Awardson.
Montreal confronts the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator.
The “muneration” is one of the tasks sent by the montreal.
The mission is “politically difficult” as California’s governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes the shooting of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the “Terminator Governor”?
“We have to be careful because the film industry itself decides which one is the best place to be.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
It is our job to offer the best possible conditions, based on which they decide,” Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now most focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote more Québeci films at every American film festival, whether it is the Sundance Film Festival, or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'Âge des teenèbres film received a positive reception for a few weeks at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, the Palm Springs International Festival will also be launched.
Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in Santa Monica and November.
Québec also represented four short films and four film films this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will it be the end of the year rally on the stock exchange? Experts will share their opinion on the \"subprime\" crisis
Almost five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have already rubbed their palms and are looking forward to the end of the normal year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “Statistically, in December, stock exchange generally behaves positively.
But only statistical-based forecasts are not necessarily correct, and in fact, in the current situation, uncertainty is characterized by market uncertainty, at least in the short term.
Experts will not discuss the end of the stock exchange year, although they declare that “the stock exchange market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives the opportunity to invest, as there are no guarantee alternatives, especially fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the escape to quality securities, as long as in the short term,”
They therefore believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral, volatility-free movement, “mostly because it is not yet familiar with the effect of the Fed-camathal Reduction, because the price of crude oil is high and the inflation tension is also at risk.”
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, i.e. it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not generally rosy.”
Ibex’s loss is nearly 4 percent compared to the highest values registered on November 8, when the index closed at point 15.945,7.
In spite of all this, not all experts are so delusional.
Juan Solana, the analyst at Intermoney, says Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 due to the reorganization of the wallets and payments to the usual pension fund at this time.
In contrast, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be turned to the second week of December, the week after the end of the Constitutional Festival.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and can experience a decrease in the stock exchange index, which may also rise depending on the news from the USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis.
The analyst believes that they will be favorable.
The analysts agree on the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoneyy, stresses that “this year there is a series of big securities.”
The expert would put the two large banks and some construction companies on the list, which would make the electricity industry very expensive by then.
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, of course, if it is at all.
“ACS has tried to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path,” the expert said.
Cyclic consumption will be the main actor in the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, the expert says that technology companies can also do well, although the representation in the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there were only two occasions in December.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003 when stock markets fell out of the crisis caused by the deflection of technology bubbles.
This year, when Ibex returned 35 28.17 percent, 668% jumps were registered in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth post-profit year (i.e. Ibex 8.36% has been increasing since January) and whether the final rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español opens an account open for 12 hours from 200 Mondays to Saturdays
Banco Popular Esañol has decided to renew most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and make a big change for the bank.
But also for other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose accounts will be open on Saturdays until 20.30.
The other group, the BBVA, which also said several times that its accounts were planning to be extended, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he has recently made an agreement with trade unions that he would close 75% of his accounts to open up in exchange for an afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Esañol will be crucial for other institutions, as it will be decided on the basis of which they will join the initiative to promote more favourable business opening.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Esañol project.
In these places, I would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local shops.
The Bank wants to operate its 200 accounts across Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned opening hours, since it is not a new opening order, but an existing conversion.
To do this, the institution will modernise its accounts in commercial zones according to the needs of individual street customers.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new kind of thinking of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, colorful design.
The responsibility of commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that there is no need for much investment to be reorganized, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees instead of the current six.
Accounts in which even negotiations for SMEs are also available will also sell non-financial products.
Adorable experiences
Banco Popular Esañol has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid accounts.
Ángel Rivero said the experience was positive.
The selection of accounts in the streets of Madridi Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía fell and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Esañol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 works under the name Mundocreddi, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units referred to in PopularMax, it is not the BBVA model where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to make competition for our customers,” Rivero said.
They were able to agree with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antena’s 3 stock exchange value
“We did it –
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, the consultant of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the market yesterday, when it turned out that the TV tax he led doubled his rival, the value of Antena 3.
Yet, one of the joys of one of them was: “It is only the pain that this is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less,” he said.
He also stressed that the weak market “we fell less”
Telecinco closed with 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase will put its annual loss to 15.66 percent.
52% of the company's mediaset, 13% of Vocento's, so its stock exchange value is 4.488.88 million euros according to Bloomberg's data.
His rival Antena lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been able to book a 40.5% fall since January, making it half yesterday, worth 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies for Sogecable is 3.571 million; for Prisa (for the Cinco Días publisher), 2.518.53 million and for Vocento 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 can be attributed to the similarities between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can meet in the same market, with what costs, and how this is reflected in our views.
Telecinco announced last week that he wanted to be the first broadcast television channel of over 1 billion ads this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publisherspaña.
If the declared fact is realised, compared to 965,4 million registered in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its revenues from advertising by 3.6% this year.
The net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (which reached 734,4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7% (630,4 million).
According to analysts, Telecinco's stock exchange momentum is one of the factors that have been maintained so far: in 2006, 100% of the profits of the company led by the President of Alejandro Echevarría were distributed by its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it would be too early to decide, this rate may change after receiving 33% of Endemol with the parent company, associated with Mediaset.
“We guarantee a minimum of 50% of our payments, although we have always shared a lot more.
I hope that we will be satisfied with our shareholders this year, because we have already benefited them with 33% of the acquisition of Endemolol.
According to analysts, the market is currently characterized by some fall.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the profitability estimates for Telecinco by 4 and 7 percent in 2008.
According to their statement, this is due to the estimated increase in sales in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
According to the same company’s forecast, Antena 3’s profit in 2008 is reduced by 4.5% and in 2009 by 7.5%.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high rentability resulting from dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (selling) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its multi-fold attractiveness and business strength.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, under-weight is suggested due to \"risk at a comparable level\" (the regulated market and the less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID in force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary process, which ended today with the Congress vote approving the amendments to the Senate, the government has launched a social dialogue on the regulation on the basis of the law, so that both can enter into life before the end of the year.
Representatives of different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable standard for investors and to regulate the activities of companies in order to function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, enables the modernisation of the financial markets, at the same time strengthens the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new directory allows financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as to securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial service provider (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the implementation of operations involving funds, thus contributing to regulated secondary markets to multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems performing orders that compete with current stock market participants.
In addition, the Act obliges investment providers to provide market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk management and risk management methods, as well as to keep a record of all operations carried out to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Committee of the Congress has adopted a number of amendments: it is of great importance that the debt securities are treated as a “complex” instrument, due to the high risk to the investor. This is confirmed by the US high-risk mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has also been used to legally outline the scope of the activities of those with economic and business qualifications. All of this is 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Decree establishing the professional functions of economists only in 1977.
The Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as a broker’s agent who works on another account, does not need CNMV permission and can market products or obtain customers for several investors at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for November.
Its publication complies with Eurostat and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The same calculation method is used for the preliminary indicator number as for the calculation of the Single Price Index, but the statistical modelling method is different to the assessment of the information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator number is merely informative and can therefore be different from the final data published on 14 December.
“The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high value.”
Pedro Solbes, a vice-president of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the rise of the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November is only of a ‘ideal nature’, but also predicted that the price index would be expected to show a ‘very high’ value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that, although the indicator number is not very favourable, the inflation rate in Spain remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also added that the month of November – less surprised than the previous month, when the government did not account for such a large increase.
“We expected around 4 % of the value,” the Minister of Economic Affairs announced in connection with the data released today.
With Northern Rock, you want to get 42 billion euros in the next three years.
Northern Rock's deposits fell by more than 50%, and currently only £12 billion (16 billion 800 million) have been issued since they were in crisis in mid-September and had to take urgent credit from the English National Bank.
Then, he had a record of over 25 billion pounds, which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the government promising a 100 percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will run this unit under its own financial, commercial name, called Virgin Money. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of British bank revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve the 30 billion target.
In England, Richard Branson’s group of prominent businessmen became known for their advertising campaigns, with a view to spending around £50 million a year (i.e. €70 million) on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the goal set.
Northern Rock highlighted the offer of the Virgin Consortium this week as the most favorable to avoid the bankruptcy. Three other companies, along with Virgin, form the consortium.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case
Today, the Police arrested the Mayor of Totana in the province of Murcia (Nép Party), as it is suspected that he was involved in a city corruption scandal this week.
He was arrested outside of the town hall as a secretary and head of the city.
The former city representative José Martínez Andreo took over Juan Morales, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, was the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city’s offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also under investigation as the chief suspect of the corrupt scandal this week.
According to information from the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company on the transfer of 200 hectares of plots.
There are currently eight people in custody.
Bono accepts the PSOE nomination in Toledo and the parliamentary presidential officer if they win the election.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, adopted the proposal to the Prime Minister of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list of tolledos in the next parliamentary elections and to fill in Parliament's presidential officer if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Organization Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and Bono confirmed the party in the Federal Center today after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister argued that “we must count on the best in politics, and Bono is among the best.”
In addition, he added that “in fact,” the Manchai politician will be nominated by the Socialist Party to the President of Parliament if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would take over the current President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he was not intending to start in the next elections and in the political career, he would rather fight against climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister was constantly suffocating him to return to the political scene since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the electors were aware of who the economic vice-president would be in the event of the victory of the Socialists, the party would have wanted to inform them of who the President of Parliament would be.
If Bono was going to fill in the post, he would like to see the Parliament – respect and not the colour of insulting or screaming – and it would be more similar to the home of citizens.
“It seems, unfortunately, that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where there is no need to speak peacefully, that the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, Manuel Marín met the current president, his “good work,” but he did not want to be described as president, not to consider his opponents “progressive.”
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement that advertises climate change is unmistakably persecuted by both skeptical behaviors and those who prefer political or social battles must be very strong.
In addition, he must bring a political leader to himself, such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and he declares that “we must enter into a new agreement with our Earth.”
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the government's activity or inactivity has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why did the Government not seek to avoid it?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish authorities what measures they intend to take to limit climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits should the population change, what individual and social level of energy savings we need to expect and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to make a sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not received or will not be explained to these questions.
It's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has led to measures, actual measures are always unfavorable.
They are expensive, comfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even the PSOE’s gas sales would have meant so unfavorable before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That Earth must be saved from nothing, simply by propaganda texts, with empty, real-life passwords.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new officers.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so well in the election campaign, you do not demand, attack, and even build election meetings and tenderness in us.

Mayor Totana and Chief of Police have been arrested for a alleged corruption case
The Department arrested the Mayor of Totana, José Martínez Andreot of the town of Murca, the local police chief, the Secretary-General of the City Hall, and a hospitality entrepreneur for the crimes related to urban development.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, currently staying there with several police officers, many of whom are being investigated by the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of the Industrial and Laks.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on the past seven Mondays, in case of a case where 2 hectares of agricultural land were transferred to an area that could be incorporated into the territory so that they could authorise the construction of 4,000 apartments for the Galician Nuaria company after having paid the leaders illegally in their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation according to the notice of the Court of Justice of Italy No. 1.
The first six people arrested were transferred to the court.
According to official sources, the former Mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who is now an independent representative of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the center of Murcia Province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), along with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, Pablo José M.G., and the latter company is also part of the Nuaria Group and through it, has been disengaged.
The investigation is carried out by a group of crimes committed at the self-government level of the Police Operations Central Unit, whose members held eleven domestic investigations outside the arrests, in particular those related to the detainees operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reviewed. The project would have doubled the population of the population of the population of the population currently living at 25,000.
Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigoban, Conycase, which is responsible for managing the parking facilities of the Coruna, Venezuelan streets and the Catholic Ferdinand Square, the sale, promotion and installation of Hogartel and the building elements specialising in direct marketing.

If you agree, let’s turn aside the Book of the Month and see if we can master some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I already installed one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can think of something themselves.

Our Finnish reporter found this comment in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (Imputably the world’s educational level at the head of the PISA report), in Sanomat Helsinki, referring to the criticism of Blackburn’s book on 18 November.
“The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela High School.
The killer quoted Plato and Nietzsche's writings in a student's preschool.
Pekka Elo, a teacher of teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with critical eyes on the daily pages of the Helsinki Sanomat, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge was not necessarily important for the compulsory basic philosophy of secondary schools.

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a liability for Internet downloads:
A. Download a music number is considered a sin and can be punished for a year from six months.
However, if you steal less than EUR 400 in a store, it is only a breach (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, theft is already a sin, but your punishment still does not reach the level of punishment applicable to online downloads (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty will still not reach the level of punishment applicable in the case of Internet download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a smaller punishment if you get into a fight than you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you will receive a penalty for three months from one year (Article 154 of the BKT), but for copying CDs from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the TFEU).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as the download of a DVD movie.
F. Sales of copyright-protected films to minors without the consent of authors is more punishable than selling pornography materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's got a lot of trouble getting out of his hands.

My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following title: “The money causes brain activity, especially if others have less of it.”
In other words, the employees’ feelings on the pay day depend on how much others have received.
The experiment was conducted at Bonni University by measuring the tomograph of magnetic resonances and published in the latest number of science.
The author of the study and the head of the Neurokognation group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participant responded correctly, and the partner made a mistake.
The researchers found that if both were given the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, activity was also enhanced.
I have no idea why such a great science had to be so simple.
Governor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been persecuted for eight years by the balcan war criminals in the Hague and the Criminal Court in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter mouth mass, as he is responsible for srebrenica's bloodshed, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radova Karajinics are still released.
Their name is on the list selected by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach for his documentary: Carla's list (not yet presented in Spain) and the film follows the work of the Swiss chief prosecutor from Belgrade to New York as soon as he tries to pressure the governments involved to put the loop around the refugees.
What insurance is equivalent to me?
Motor insurance, which is a security of the vehicle owner’s significant expenditure against the various damages and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type and nature of use of the car to be provided.
Getting a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often harder than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to know what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes compensation in the head of the fixed insurance fee in the event of damage.
The insurance fee is virtually the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the certificate, family status, type of car to be provided, use of it and others.
Insurance companies determine the insurance fee on the basis of statistics, i.e. they pay a higher amount of the person who represents a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why women over 25 years old or women pay less, as statistics say they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the reports, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of use of the car is crucial.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When establishing the insurance fee, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look at the choice of the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
We will then present the most important elements of the choice to best adjust and make an acceptable price for the needs of the guaranteed.
Upon conclusion of the insurance contract, the under 25-year-olds must have a number of backgrounds, such as lack of management experience and updating of the licence.
Although the most ideal is to ensure that we are safe against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
The more cautious leaders can make a complete insurance with self-sustaining, ensuring that they are safe against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In such a type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The level of self-payment to be paid by the insured person depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the part itself,” says Luis Noguera, head of the Internet insurance intermediary First Europa in Spain.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties when the client provides himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, it will also be secured against theft, fire alarm and car loss.
A good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as soon as possible, because this is an impact on the bonus and so you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
A bonus is called discounts on the basic tariff of the insurance company.
The punishment for the basic tariff is called Raspberry.
\"The level of bonus and raspberries depends on the company and its profits.
If the company has been a good year, it can allow you to increase the amount of bonus,” explains Noguera.
If you have already crossed the 25-year-old age limit, it is easier for the owners to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience acquired over the years.
Then we advise you to take full insurance with you.
“In general, young people are not able to properly apply their experience during an accident, even when driving,” says the Spanish director of the European Insurance Company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of management when leaders have gone beyond the fears of beginners.
If the insured is already female, but you don’t have children, it’s best to make a complete insurance, of course, if your financial opportunities allow this.
Insurance companies hold children’s couples to the lowest risk customers, so they also pay less.
In this case, the best complete insurance is self-sustained (it can reach 300 euros) or if they have a higher bonus, the insurance can be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the harm caused by others.
“They lead more calmly, but they can allow themselves to be higher than their own,” says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we offer a complete insurance (which is around 150 euros) or can be extended to liability insurance for higher bonuses.
Motor insurance is a very important thing, not only because it represents protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a great issue, so it is essential to properly choose a personalised form of insurance.
Celtic wants to get the point in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will measure the power of the San Siro stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point at the end of the League of Champions. The Italians can be the first, and the Scottishs can qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round, they have provided the way forward with a tie-in with Portugal, and Celtic has nine points, but one more should be that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight with the four-point Benfica, should not be prevented.
The D Group will hold two matches a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play at the Club World Cup in Japan, where on 13th of the year he will try to fight for the 16th final.
This group of D will end sooner than the rest, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the final, the two teams will strive to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and Celtic can start from a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team is even losing enough to qualify themselves if the Shahhtar won't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's a score equality, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2-1) last week, but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to confuse the evening of the Scottishs, who would like to be involved twice after each other in the eighth finals of the League of Champions League, after receiving a goal in the previous season from the Kaka in the subsequent extension of 0-0.
The “Rossanders” win the Shakhtar would be most pleased, because if you lost Celtic you will be in the eighth final and remain in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in the last place and inability to stay in the European Championship, can still get the third place with a win to play in the UEFA.
Twenty thousand people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of Spice Girls' Tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Kanada) started their tour, and they first appeared before 20,000 viewers since they split up in 2000.
\"Posh Spice\" (Victoria Beckham), \"Scary Spice- (Melanie Brown), \"Baby Spice- (Emma Bunton), \"Sporty Spice\" (Melanie Chisholm) and \"Ginger Spice\" (Geri Halliwell) were announced for a few minutes before the concert at the Vancouver GM Place that they were in the form of joint-rems.
More than 20,000 people have received tickets to be there at the concert, where a video film was presented in the 1990s about the history of a large group of successes.
With the composition of the band and the tour, the EMI also launched a new album in Spain, on which the larger slides and the two new songs are \"Headlines\" and \"Voodoo\".
The five members of Spice Girls, from the husband of Posh Spice, entered the stage in a bracelet from David Beckham, British football player.
The athlete was there at the GM Place's glare, although Victoria had been banned a few days earlier.
At the time of the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star did not see our acting dress, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show.
“Sporty Spice” was the reason that the band split up two years after leaving the band in 1998, “because the members did not understand each other,” he appeared nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
“I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings that they felt about Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I decided this way,\" Chisholm said about the band that broke up nine years ago.
The singer also added that during the time, “ things were organized and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, Virgin Airlines came to Vancouver.
At the airport, a team of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
They have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will take place in California (USA), then in San Jose (Dec. 4) and Los Angeles (Dec. 5 and 7).
In Madrid, they will act on 23 December.
Other fears about the Russian-Ukraine gas dispute
Between Ukraine and Russia, the gas price has been renewed, which can also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) will be transferred through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations will always be held with great attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to the EU countries fell.
The recent debate between Kiev and Moscow is about the attempt by the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, on an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the scale of the gas price to be paid to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that in the case of gas produced from neighboring Turkmenistan, a 50% increase should be made compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
“It is important to argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important natural gas supply transit states,” the Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatolij Kinah told Reuters’ news agency.
\"The changes in gas prices should, in any case, be linked to our debate on the cost of transit (and transit to Western Europe) to Ukraine.
As a result of the recent significant gas price spread between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant reduction in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly reduced prices.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is made by Russian gas.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom’s own gas supply is complemented by natural gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries.
The NHS obligation to check foreign workers
The Scottish NHS committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was followed by Robert Black’s chief accountant after a foreign nationalist doctor in Scotland was brought into contact with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of workers overseas.
However, in its report, through five models of health authorities, it also pointed out key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following an attack on the airport in Glasgow, the main auditor verified the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a Iraqi doctor of Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a dzsip moved to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three physicians who had been interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October on the charges of a car bomb attack in the UK.
In the case of their employees from overseas countries, the NHS committees should check the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and the availability of permits for employment in the United Kingdom before the start of employment.
While the Scottish Health Committees are using Discovery Scotland to verify the criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The report of the main auditor has, among other things, proposed that committees introduce the Code of Criminal Register Office, which facilitates the monitoring process with the various overseas countries.
“Although we have found evidence of such checks on staff records, they are not regularly implemented,” the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own review procedure at the same level before employment, adding: “Our report highlights the potential areas of the system to be developed in order to have up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas staff.
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it is “explicitly impossible” to identify potential NHS employees who can carry out terrorist acts in the future through pre-employment checks.
According to the report, pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of their overseas staff from doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the main auditor pointed out that the numbers are likely to be higher, which can partly be explained by the fact that it is a problem for committees to identify workers on a non-decisionary period of freedom.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, the Grampin, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian have been largely coordinated.
These procedures cover checks on passports, employment permits and documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Directive and guidance on the prevention of the employment of NHS workers from overseas countries.
Nicola Stureon’s health secretary said: “I was very pleased to have been able to carry out this task following the attack on the airport in Glasgow.
Furthermore, he added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated version is published in the following month.
Joy Division Tarol at the Film Award
Joy Division’s late singer, Ian Curtis, was awarded five awards at the British Independent Film Award, including the best film prize.
He also received a prize from the main character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis's formation, as well as director Anton Corbijn and co-founder Toby Kebbel.
The award for the best actress Dame Judi Dench won with the “ details of a scandal.”
And the Variety Prize - for setting the British film in international reflector light - Daniel Craig, who is shaping Bondo.
The awards were awarded in the framework of the London Roundhouse ceremony.
“Control” shows Curtis’s rise to suicide within Joy Division Berkein until 1980, when she committed suicide when she was 23 years old.
The production of a ‘The Killers’, David Bowie, as well as a ‘New Order on the Soundtrack’ was just 3 million pounds.
The Dutch photographer, Corbijn, who previously became known by the album director U2-Joshua Tree, was rich in two awards, with the award of the best director and best starter.
Another prize winner of the ceremony put rock music at the center; Julien Temple Joe Strummer's film on Clash's singer took the award for the best documentary film.
The best actor's award was Viggo Mortensen for the formation of David Cronenberg's troller, the chief executive of the \"Gyllus promises\" in London.
Ray Winstone, obsessed by the roles of the tough guy, was awarded Richard Harris for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, including the \"Scum\", \"Ekoppon\", and \"Sexy dog\" films, is currently engaged in the film \"King of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Coponya\".
Winston is proud to take over the award of \"Camelot\" and \"Harry Potter\", named after Harris in 2002.
“For people like me, people open doors like Richard Harris and Albert Finney,” he added.
“I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris's style is close to me, his age was a great actor, and I highly appreciate him.
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Among Bifa's supporters and patrons, Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbott.
In Saudi Arabia 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, who were designed to carry out an upcoming attack on an oil plant, as well as several attacks on the people of the Church and security forces.
According to the state television of the world’s largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against monarchy, which has been active as an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to a television report, eight-person cells led by a foreign citizen are to launch an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province.
After the 2006 attack on the world’s largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began to build a 35,000-person rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to a report by the Minister of the Interior, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell that is the result of a person illegally crossing the country border.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
In 22 of the prisoners, plans were made to commit the assassinations of Church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a tougher action against the Church leaders to curb Saudis connecting to Iraq, Al-Qaeda, who are fighting the Allied Forces and the US-backed Sislim government.
Al-Qaeda fighters are considered to be a significant part of the Church leaders in Saudi Arabia as the authorities involved in supporting the royal family policy of the government.
The fighters of the organization, inspired by Al-Qaeda Saudi leader, Osama bin Laden, were attacked by foreign residents, government buildings and energy facilities.
“The security forces have made huge efforts over the last five months,” said a spokesperson at the Ministry of Internal Affairs on public television.
During the arrests, a 16-person media cell was also caught in Medina, whose goal was to spread the “Takfiri thinking”. Takfiri thought is the ideology of the Muslim radicals of the Republic, which supports violence against the unbelief and believed Muslims.
There were also 32 people who were accused of financial support for militants.
Venus’s climate can provide an overview of Earth’s future
Scientists found that Venus was once able to provide a pleasant living environment.
The data from a European circular spaceship suggest that this planet is much more regarded as the magical twin brother of the Earth than we previously believed.
Venus is the nearest planet of the Earth.
In terms of the size of the two planets, almost the same and their orbiting orbits are similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists know today that several billion years ago Venusnson could have been very similar living conditions to Earth, and even inhabited relationships could have been given.
However, due to the extremely high carbon glass effect, the atmosphere caused by sunlight, and the lower rotation speed of the planet, Venus entered a field of development.
Today, the water from the planet exploded, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and hurricanes and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express’s space probe, based on a year’s study of the planet, describe how similar catastrophic climate change can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford, who is one of the leaders of Venus Express's mission, said: “Keep drawing why Venus's climate is so much different from the Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar.
“Our new data enabled us to develop a script about the development of Venus with billions of years ago, when it was possible to have living conditions similar to Earth.
Police-deposited uranium -
A kilo of radioactive material - the uranium, which has been depressed according to reports, was taken yesterday by the Slovaks and the Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was also examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was a depressed uranium, but stated that the material would have been awarded for $1 million ($480 000).
Open Gates
According to Mitt Romney, he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded and forwarded their questions to the candidates.
None of the issues that were reported on Wednesday 28 November proved ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching the next year’s election.
For the time being, it is not known how CNN’s manufacturers who co-financed the dispute have selected YouTube clips submitted to candidates.
The longest question of the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' lobbyists.
CNN has asked some insecure voters that, if they have heard a lie, they will draw a number: the mediator has experienced an outstanding consensus when candidates have pronounced a serious point of view on the issue of borders.
The most lively and long-lasting debate was between the Rudy Giuliani, who was leading at the national level, and the Romney, who was ahead of the decisive pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture that, during the mayor of New York, he was too easily treated with the issue of illegal immigration.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from former Massachusetts to build the house.
The discussion between them became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in the support of “amnesty” (which would guarantee permanent status and the possibility of citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter, California and Tom Tancredo, have been thoroughly involved in the topic.
Even though none of them are likely to be on the label, they may have been explained by the fact that they started to collide the bells that were singing immigration sooner and more loud.
At least in the area of immigration, a broad consensus can be observed among candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and a hard action against illegal immigrants.
This theme, like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other factors of unrest from the outside world, promotes that the division between the liberals and Christian conservatives may be forgotten or minimized.
However, when other topics were addressed, the debate was very uncomfortable.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether the simulated water pollution should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates believed all the Bible’s words.
In this question, Giuliani became aware of the fact that although he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, the history of Jonah and the whale might not literally be interpreted.
It was another question whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first to acquire the first place in the Iowa election, has been able to win the victory of a capable Christian conservativeism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but needed.
When they were wondering if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed to say that Jesus was wiser than he was going to the election.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's immediate search for iowa coincides with the liberal Ron Paul's fundraising action and the enthusiasm to live up to him in Wednesday's debate.
The sudden outbreak of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to set up a joint candidate of the aspirants representing more well-known and more traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who joined the party, who in time and convincingly struggled the winning message that advertised the size of America and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences of this are still invisible.
Labour Party Pains
Another gap ahead of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, it doesn't seem to be too tight.
No one sold his honor, no politician found his Paris hotel accounts, no one committed a scandal outside his marriage.
However, finding out that a wealthy businessman for more than four years has contributed a £650 000 ($1.3 million) to the Labour Party in Great Britain, and that he did not report this party, one of the things without which Gordon Brown would have been well-founded.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister escaped the election, and when, by stating that public opinion polls did not affect the outcome of the decision, he doubted the intellectual capacity of the Britishs, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, a leader of liberal democrats with increasingly spiritful remarks, once feared Brown Stalin was transformed into Mr. Bean.
The left-wing to save Northern Rock's failed bank has crucified the regulatory weaknesses and the lack of judgment.
The patient proposals to amend the tax law encouraged the business interest groups to reconcile with the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authority is unimaginably detected by a high degree of administrative incompetence.
In the House of Lords, three restless generals were raised, who protested against the reduction of the army budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defense is part-time occupation.
And now there are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labour Party (first administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point in which management is impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their infidelity.
However, as it becomes clear that the prime minister is highly unlikely to be able to advance things and perhaps not stay on his post for a long time, the suspended infidelity is over: the civil servants’ faculty is starting to leak, the cabinet ministers will be in adjustment, the press will look after bad oral news, and the government will be vulnerable and unable to focus.
Brown is in a particularly difficult position, because unlike other political leaders, he doesn’t count as “fresh blood.”
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was his right hand.
For example, the problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax returns are linked to decisions taken during the time of Brown’s Finance Minister.
And while it was not directly involved in the current investigation of the relationship between a matter and political party funding in the Blair left-wings, such as the \"no money\", voters could be entitled to assume the opposite of that.
Although Brown's situation is actually unpleasant, it's not as awkward as it seems.
The attacks committed are not as scary as those throats indicate.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly from him.
And the compensation - whatever the pain comes - can always create the directions promised by the Brown-based Stalin: reliable, solid and slightly hard-working governance.
For example, it serves the coolness around political donation.
The garboan-celled Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said he did not want to reveal his favor to the public.
Perhaps so, however, the decision was not in his power.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who knocks at the gates of the country’s leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams’ measure, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interrogations; as Jon Medleson, the founder of the Labour Party, who was informed of the disturbing donations in October.
Brown, for the time being, does not lead the strands: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge amounts were paid after Brown's entry into office in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister's task has been half.
However, the violation of the law by the party was quickly condemned, but its strength was diluted by the fact that it reached a familiar instrument; the investigation of the case, for the sake of safety, entrusted a retired bishop and a judge to the committee.
In this story, the lesson to learn is not too complicated.
In case of infringement, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown must take other things in order, such as the appointment of the President of the independent committee on administrative rules without the six months of leadership, or the prior amendment of the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require cooperation from the hard hat worker party with the towers and break up with special financial relations related to the associations - it would already be a hard wall for the party Brown.
But you should face some of the parties.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading a serious advantage; Brown has two years to conquer voters behind himself; the only way to leverage the victory is uncontested integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second market mortgage market crisis threatening America’s credit card market?
If blood comes into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the US housing market is weak, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the loss of the credit card market can reach $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clear.
Both the percentage of uninhabited loans increased, both the rate of late payments beyond 30 days.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss last month in the US consumption finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The number of reports and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate by the Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is 389% lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the U.S. rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in insolvency in the number of reporting agents, but at the same time a large loss in the credit card market; a re-increase in the number of bankruptcy claims (and thus a description ratio) is expected, regardless of whether the total number of lending conditions is worsen or not.
The rate of payment, which shows the monthly credit deletion of consumers, is also strong on the market.
In addition, confidence in credit cards is quite strong, despite the deterioration in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of a mortgage market crisis are clear on the credit card market: consumers are raising debt on credit cards to erase housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers are mainly looking at cash movements and not asset value, so the drop in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
For creditors, the situation can be beneficial.
If the property reaches less than the mortgage value, incentives for consumers to cancel credit are reduced; as a result, the repayment of debt on credit cards will take place in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limit, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexiblely to changing conditions compared to mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-allocation of devices.
“One day we’re not likely to wake up to fully review the loans,” says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual fall is much more likely.
If the declining housing market prices and the decline of lending are recessioning America, the industry will look forward to the future without any doubt.
It is worth observing those predators.
British bankers claim to be guilty of Enron
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were appointed by Enron’s former financial director for the investigation of their role in the fraud called Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially found innocent in the accusation of seven-day fraud, which supposedly cooperated with Fastow in a secret fraud in 2000, which they wanted to make money at the expense of their employer.
The trial began in January.
However, at a hearing before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted his guilt in a single fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Greenwich NatWest became known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition process.
After the collapse of Enron in 2001, the investigation of the case is still waiting for you in the United States.
In 2002, he warned Fastow that he was one of his targets for a government investigation into Enron’s bankruptcy.
The three brokers who crossed the Threesomes of NatWest were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare for fraud together with Michael Kopper, the best-hand Michael Kopper of Fastow and Fastow.
Fastow, who is responsible for planning countless frauds in the bankruptcy of Enron, also managed the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew that interest was very high.
A company managed by Kopper bought the bank’s share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $25,000 to get a share in this company.
Fastow reportedly informed Enron that the energy company was purchasing a subsidiary share of $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charges are held by bankers at $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his two-way guilt as a result of the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently punishing six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month's punishment in a Texas prison.
The three English men were able to travel to the United States in the head of a $1 million bail per head, where they stayed during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest U.S. company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used for years had no longer been able to cover millions of debt-acquired and profitable, but actually lost businesses.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value decreased by more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skiling last year, was convicted of their involvement in bankruptcy.
Skilling now spends more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with Rolls-Royce engine will start with a single tank without interruption of the road between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount is only a small amount for some Russian rich.
“18 passengers fit in,” said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
“No one orders so many meetings because they buy machines for private families or corporate leaders.
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive, Milliomos Fair, held in the huge show hall in the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, there are more than 200 other luxury shops that have rented stand at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new owners are interested in everything, from mahogany-coated yachts to diamond-coated, 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche that was exhibited on the stand next to him.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s not worth our products,” he said.
Private aircraft after the United States have the largest market in Russia.
The Russian capital seems to swim in money as Dallas did in the light of the time of the oil explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s when we went to a few American millionaires. These Americans were considered to be material here,” Marshall Goldman, a professional scholarship from the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, said.
Like the Japanese gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and in the 1990s, the Russians have now launched the world’s most spectacular poets.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold glass.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of the LVMH, shared his opinion on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of wealthiest people, 53 billion people live in Russia, who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class reaches 103 grand, who can make a total of $670 billion, a study of personal well-being in the former Soviet Union, conducted by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(The World Bank data in 2005 showed that 15.8 per cent of people under the minimum population in Russia.)
“More than 100 millionaires live in Moscow, so we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris in London.
Nicole took part in the market for the first time with the Russian distributor Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women were immeasurably treated, and men are a real treasure mine.”
In the rooms on Sunday night, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both owned themselves and their customers a millionaire.
“I looked at the cars and try to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” Yumatova, a young man who has been snoreding in his unique design dress, as if he was used to this drive.
The fair was mainly arranged for new owners, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around a cozy, Cifran decorated site after several hours of circulation, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum handcuffs, Mötgenpick ice cream, standard billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund pluss.
For average people, the ticket will cost 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians love to know which brands are the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, a nationalist in the Netherlands, at the Royal Delft stand, compared to a wall-sized, hand-painted, blue exchange-painted Rembrandt imitation.
“The Russians, of course, are more interested in the outstanding things.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that for a long time (based on Russian stenders, this means 10-15 years) the wealthy Russians have already been partying from the outside logos to brands with a limited number of brands that would not enter a commercial market.
However, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, have spent their place every day in the cold.
Some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of King Koil's bed, said that day he sold two singles of $70,000 each, made of silk, chamber and cotton, a gold thread.
Also, on the first night of the day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales agent on the supply of modern alarms for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold Light Orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, the luxury car manufacturer, L.A. Connection, has sold three refrigerators on Sunday afternoon to Rolls-Royce Phantom. The bars are similar to connected chains and cost $55,000 each.
The reporters also showed a wheel made for the Russian casino owner, which, according to Swarovski, was attracted by crystals to create a roulette wheel.
Price of a set of four: $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to take a picture of his wife’s body and his wife’s face will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapetian said.
“He’s going to keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars.
Despite the fact that many of the Russian customers are rich, Karapetian says the term “Russian millionaires” today does not represent a great privilege, considering the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“He who bought property in Moscow four to five years ago is likely to be a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
\"There are more than you think \"
Those who are not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth in front of the Alliance Continental Russian property company.
The company built four, English-style telephones that were accumulated with millions of fake dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500 thousand fake bank notes on the Milliomos Buyer.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with money. Many of them made photos of themselves by mobile phone as they were in the money ring or only put a few million in the pocket.
“In Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” Karryev said.
They suspect an accident in New Jersey.
On the day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked at the “Only a little healthier” restaurant on a flat glass window and saw a rescue car stop on Cape Cod with two doors down at West Scott Avenue.
A police car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
“After that, I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Mr. Livingston, one of the doctors at the restaurant on Wednesday.
“Then I knew someone was dead.”
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She used to work as a senior assistant to the police director in Newark.
The investigation is currently underway to find out if the death was caused by an intervention by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police.
The authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they are hoping that the results of the toxicology tests will light this mysterious death, which affected the high-ranking workers of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known in the department, has been an assistant to the police since September 2006, alongside Garry F. McCarthy.
“It was loyal, diligent and reliable,” said McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector.
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the former Newark police officer, she was currently a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, who worked in the Sescist Product Control Committee, and left two, a 14 and a 11-year-old boys and a stepmom.
Yesterday, Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were working on investigating whether Mrs. Arroyo was a victim of unauthorized surgery.
“It’s likely,” he said.
“The investigation is currently underway.”
According to the reports of the authorities, they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
On 21st and Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was already declared dead on the site.
More than a week passed, and the police have sold very little of the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
He didn't tell me if the detectives were listening to Castro.
In the study, participants will find out if part of the house is functional as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a cold roseboke was standing in the middle of the narrow front and a songless barked from the back of the house.
In addition to the door to the basement, the vehicle was equipped with a blue tank with “Etil Vanlin”, which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
From the hooks to two statin bikes on the hung side.
McCarthy recalled that after 25 years at the New York police station, she first arrived to Newark, Mrs Arroyo, for an invaluable help to help her get to the new city's unusual and unspoken political culture.
He always said, “It will be better to take care of it,” he remembered.
He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was still there when I left the evening.
He was upset.
Expectations for Fed interest cuts lead to the collapse of the world’s stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the stock prices jumped yesterday after the words of the Deputy President of the Central Bank of the United States increased their hopes for the Fed to make it easier to invest with additional interest cuts.
The stock markets both in London and in New York and across Europe have gone on after Donald Kohn, who said that Fed President Ben Bernanke had a better hand, the leaders had to respond to the constant unrest in financial markets.
In addition to the clear purpose of Kohn to slow down the markets in the midst of the reinventive credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest had partially reversed the development of the market in late September and October.
He said that if increased confusion persists, further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies could increase the possibility.
The statements were interpreted by investors as being ready to invest fresh capital in the U.S. markets or even in additional interest cuts in order to stabilize the credit conditions.
The statements also had a relaxing impact on Wall Street, which has recently been understood by several bad news about the U.S. economy, such as a negative record of the number of U.S. housing supplies.
The side effects of financial unrest have also been confirmed by the announcement by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will release around 650 employees and 4% of its global labour force as part of the cost reduction.
The total 20 jobs of the London headquarters employing 1500 workers are affected by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average increased by 331 points, 2.55% and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65%.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, by 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2, and thus increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Credit market unrest has been renewed since the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank has been at a 4.7% price for European banks since April 2001.
After the interbank interest rate in England, Libor reached the highest value since September 12, 659%, the Bank of England was all under pressure to follow Fed and the ECB, and to give additional capital to the London monetary market.
In England, the decision is required between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should the English team be six in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in connection with the first test against Sri Lanka, is it not less important, who makes the decision?
The last question is current because David Graveney, the chairman of the electors who temporarily performs this task, assists the leading coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughn in the decision. On the other hand, because the English CEO, Hugh Morris' desk, will start to meet the requests for national or at least one-off selection post.
Among the two players, pull the shorter, which does not get the sixth battered place, but as known, life, and, above all, sports are often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell what makes someone’s profession at the top, while others can’t get to a lower level. Often it’s more fortunate than it depends on talent.
It is not only the critique that it is difficult to choose - often on subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair for Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and \"Tubby-Banerjee, two young leaders with smart, excellent qualifications, who are well-known for business, would be put before decision makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell you what level a cricket player is going to be without throwing into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data greatly influences the decision, but the possibilities are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain's look in the cricket closet at the right moment, and a bat player has to get a chance if he wants to become a big player.
The sight of the electors is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, has played better in the past season, but he still thinks he's a team member on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own saying he's in good shape and he's very good at it.
Anderson's 32 first-class gate shot and 33 runs to fight for his participation on the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them had successful moments at the highest level and hopes that they would be like this in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara are going to play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well this will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision can or may break anyone’s career, but it may not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played well on every test and played well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet the then emerging Paul Collingwood was the one who became a prominent and decisive test critic, who may still be underestimate even today, despite finding a double score against Australia, the Australians.
It is likely that during their meeting with Graveney, Vaughn and Moores in Asgiriya Stanion today, listening to their conservative feelings, will take place in addition to the greater experience of Shah, their vocality, the young vitality and dynamics of Bopara.
Both are arguments.
In addition to Shah, the bright and successful debuting of the 88 bombay test was performed in the quarters. He was seven years younger than the six of the 22-year-old Bopara, who, by the way, also had an excellent screw shot, reached 32 first-class hundred.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, in the Lorda test against West Indies, ran only ten times in two quarters, and the fact that Vaughan, who was fighting again in the next game, faced the immediate resistance of the elect, seems to have reduced its endurance, which was still clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex’s universal talent is a lifelong and inexhaustible player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the cricket track, but he was very well off-the-art when the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen, had a four-wheel.
However, the first thing he did was to take Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) into his hands and call him a remote teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, \"You saw it.\"
Bopara is a better tracker with classics. For its narrowed medium steps, it develops a preferred drum angle, and its blows are confident and competent.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of selection.
I personally think I'd give Bopara the chance, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would offer an outstanding if - as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest - he would be the one who plays the weekend.
They bring refugees home with buses to work and fight Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Iraq come to Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or lost their visa or, in fact, those who hope that the order will be restored again in the city.
There are also those who have returned to fight the soldiers who have driven them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan before an 800-man bus station from Damascus arrived at the government.
“I decided to go to Syria after a lot of doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubais.
“I returned today because I saw what happened on TV and newspapers in Baghdad and that the city was safe now.
“They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people,” he added, referring to Moqda al-Sadr, a milicist pastor, who has now shut down his ski army.
The 38-year-old ski teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who lived by the Republicans, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking a job.
Amariai's ski neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that the U.S. supported troops managed to push Al-Qaeda out of their statues in the western part of the capital.
One of the first arrivals from Jordan was a Sudanese and Shiite tribe leader who fled from the home of the North Baghdad Sleikh after his fellow citizens began to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed support for me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many have been talking about the fact that in the capital of the United States, they have been lured home by armed civilian forces in cooperation with the Americans since the involvement of American troops.
However, more people have been forced to return from Damascus due to water and financial problems.
The 51-year-old three-child Salaam al-Samarrai expressed a widespread view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the visa application for refugees to force their return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have escaped from the deaths in the country.
“It was all right until al-Maliki’s visit to Syria and did not put pressure on the government to stop issuing more visas for Iraqis in order to move them home,” said the Finnish pensioner.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I fled.”
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the sunnits have been expelled from the ski areas, while the skis have also left the sunnite inhabited areas. As a result, tension has been reduced in many regions.
Many are afraid that the sudden appearance of refugees will reintegrate the fields, which can lead to further struggles.
Small Saar Region - Educational training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training, and higher education is an international orientation.
Only a training area is fought by island regions with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
“I explained to an outside of the island fifty times a day that we are not French,” he said, “this is the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saar Region, which, based on the surveys of the German Institute of Economics (IW), can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions, already because of traditions, work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Students will be able to complete their studies with a double or even three degree today.
The proportion of foreign students is higher by 15.6 percent.
However, the island-regions also practice an over-average attraction for those who want to learn from the island, many of them have no high school qualifications.
“In the Saar region, they take advantage of the possibilities of vocational training,” explains Axel Plünecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
Young people in more than a fifth vocational school get a right of further learning, thus the Saarland region reaches the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities for professional and higher education have also been well established.
The infrastructure for double studies is located in the second place in Germany.
However, despite practical training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Island has therefore committed the higher education institutions to a marketing campaign that focuses on engineering.
“We started a number of reforms in primary schools after the first Pisa study,” a spokesman at the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has carried out comparative tests across the country.
To start learning earlier, the last preschool year is free of charge. This is a model that, in the meantime, the other federal provinces began to copy.
Whether the student’s performance will continue to improve, it will only be answered by comparative studies in the future.
Based on the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk dropped from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, the island’s performance has not improved as much as the rest of the federal provinces.
The bourgeois count better.
The greatest revenge of the island-regions during the Pisa interview will not be taken into account by the foreign language expertise - otherwise, they would be able to take bets in this area otherwise,
Because the language of neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the island regions are not French.
Chávez transforms the clocks
In Venezuela in the near future, clocks are different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez reverses time meters in Latin America for half an hour.
At the same time, Chávez became an object of laughing in Spain.
As Venezuela’s official newspaper said, according to a new law, the classes are turned back four and a half hours compared to the time of the greenwichi.
In this way, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country of the world.
Among other things, the U.S. anti-American Chavez has justified his decision to force all-hour-based time zones into the world.
Chávez also announced the interruption of relations with neighboring Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian government will be in contact.
“I cannot do this because of my own dignity,” said Chávez, who called for a constitutional reform that should be an opinion within a referendum on Sunday’s citizens.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe, with his decision, \"Arcul köpte - Venezuela, gave a sound to his criticism of Chávez Sunday.
Everyone is talking about Chávez in Spain.
In the country, a new voice called “Port qué no you callas” (why you don’t take your mouth), sounds like a sentence that has been filled by more than half a million people from the Internet.
The sentence comes from John Charles, the King of Spain, who was so angry at the last Latin American summit in the Baloldian populist politicians that he cut into his word.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans.
A real wage reduction is expected to threaten German workers this year despite strong conjunctivities.
Experts have backed up their pessimistic predictions with chorus.
According to Hans-Bröckler’s report, in 2007 employees can actually pay less than in the previous year.
“This is the reason for modest wage development, the increase in general traffic tax, as well as the rapid rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn, co-worker of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Works.
Employment insurance can also be subject to additional burdens on workers.
Peer Steinbrück’s Minister of Finance said in his statement “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung,” that the current situation would reduce the right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation as to apply for credit or support to the alliance, quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
Tuesday it became known that the flooding of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation for 13 years.
In an annual comparison, prices increased by 3 percent.
Venus is the devil's twin brother of the earth.
Despite Venus’s stormy atmosphere, it’s more like Earth than it has been assumed to be: in its atmosphere, the lightnings of the European “Venus Express” space probe were discovered in the corners of Europe, and in its corners, windmills such as they were born on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists think Venus is flashing.
The European “Venus Express” space probe has provided evidence of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere: The lightnings in Venus spread around 56 miles [56 km] high from cloud to cloud, reports Christpher Russel, a member of the University of California in Loss Angeles.
According to the famous “emergency theory,” the world was created by lightnings: According to the theory, zivatars started reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
“If there has ever been a life there, it may have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there can hardly be a living organism on Venus’s surface: the atmosphere is hundreds of times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“It may be that Venus is a hell of a twin brother of the earth, but yet it is his twin brother,” Rusel said.
The main issue of the Esa-transmission is why Venus is so similar to Earth in its mass and size is going on a completely different development path.
“Venus Express’s launch in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early nineties, no probe was on its way to explore this planet.
The latest research results already presented in the articles “Nature” are, in the opinion of the researchers, not only evidence of the uniqueness of Venus’s solar system.
“They also hope that the similarity of the neighboring planet to the Earth is greater than we expected at first,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known northern corner curve, researchers discovered a much faster cloud trail on the southern corner.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air flows of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, claims the research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, with a diameter of 12.100 miles, and almost as large as the Earth.
The celestial body called the Esthajnal Star will be avoided in just 225 days.
However, it is much slower to turn around its own plot: an old day lasts up to 243 Earth days.
Although the temperature of the 460 Celsius-footed surface with pressure from Venus 92 bar barely resembles the Earth, scientists begin by creating both planets in a completely similar environment.
Both of them gathered up water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus left the universe.
And while carbon dioxide in the Earth is bound in carbon leakages, Venus is a large part of this atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, President of the German Republic, is calling for an end to the dispute between the parties that exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
In a way, he criticised the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and has called for a large coalition to complete the debate that was launched around the Dalai Lama.
“In this question, we should not appear as a divided nation to the outside world,” said Köhler in Handelsblatt.
Köhler also expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) accepted the Dalai Lama in September.
“The human rights apply to me universally even if I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to take care of the external policy-related balance, the President of the Republic stressed, but Merkel's defence against the accusation that the Chancellor would continue to pursue a new Chinese policy.
“The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional Chinese policy.
China is also aware of this,” said Köhler.
Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD), indirectly, gave the voice of his provocation over the reception of the Dalai Lama, and therefore became the target table of attacks in the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's policy on foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in Catalonia, there were severe disruptions in the German-China relationship.
Thus, Chinese leadership has not only restored the invitation of the German Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chinese Head of State, has now called upon Angela Merkel to admit that the acceptance of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects European politicians accepting the religious leader of Tibetans in their official quality, strengthening the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that he is attempting to break further Tibetan territories including Tibet and other provinces of today.
Schäuble protects against disruptions similar to French people
Street collisions with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble is protected from disruptions similar to French people.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not go into street violence, the Federal Interior Minister demands.
Barricades flamed, randomly shot with a beer gun to the police: After the serious disruptions of young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble's Federal Interior Minister (CDU) is responsible for similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be aware that the social explosives do not accumulate with us and do not go into violence.
We must take this seriously,” he said, “Neue Presse,” a newspaper appearing in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Associations, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
\"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been demonstrated.
However, it is too early to get rid of the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociology problems in the German suburbs, such as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris in the last night, young people fought serious street battles with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also lit in Toulouse.
In view of this, the federal government, Kenan Kolat, the head of the German Turkish communities, called for more activity in the area of integration.
With regard to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned about the dangers of ‘return’.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But it is necessary to act.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is “higher than the average”
There should be more educational places before all.
Kolat stressed: “We need to provide a perspective for young people.
However, the Turkish Community leader added that “social supervision within the family is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: “In spite of this, we have to be honest.
Young people should be given the opportunity to work and receive education more quickly.
Meanwhile, in Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, the entire rest of the night.
There were hundreds of officers ready to be deployed, and a helicopter with a light light bulb, pampered the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests, as well as some flames of trash and car.
Since the report, a security unit of 1000 people has been responsible for calming down.
The police will be ready to intervene as long as necessary, after the visit by Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Interior.
During the night on Tuesday, 80 policemen were wounded due to the villiers-le-bel disorders.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The attacks have been caused by a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first state prosecutor, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
the Angela Empire
The Chancellor’s action is proof of the end of the coalition – and nothing is expected of him.
Which country is the Federal Chancellor?
Following the general debate of the Bundestag, it is necessary to establish its common and non-exhaustive action: it is not here - it is not in the country in which its governance would be his business.
Yes, he rejected the accusation of Angela Merkel to focus too much on foreign policy.
This was provincial, he responded, and in this way he only expressed the expression that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Meeting, it made it clear to everyone how inventive the eyelashes were.
At the same time, neither particular interest nor empathy could be felt in the problems of the country.
Instead, the Uprising Angela emerged: a politicalist who is stuck from reality who is fleeing to foreign policy and there is only uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendamm’s actions are unbridled, but listens to how the goals of climatisation should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-respect is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years ago.
It is now becoming a result of the fact that the prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This caused him to gain good news as a pragmatic personality, who, instead of the voivores, offers a solution to problems.
However, in Angela’s empire, domestic policy problems are only ancillary things.
Children’s poverty and low income problems?
This is just for a few half words.
There is a lot to say about how often it takes for a family replacement.
Merkel's got to get three times to bring a half-a-half sentence.
When it comes to concrete things, it's botched in a foreign area.
Romham Department
During the debate on YouTube, the Republican presidential candidates held a hard blow between the two Favores, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, and they must be held from an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first topic.
Mitt Romney says to the opponent, Ruth Giuliani, that “the rescue of illegal immigrants,” made New York.
“I would say that his own house was safe for illegal immigrants,” says Giuliani, and he said, “I would say that he was a private person with no documents.
Candidates are on the run: Since the Republican camp still has no single support for the race, eight presidents use the debate on CNN to undermine its opponent’s credit.
The 30-second videos sent by Internet users through YouTube are hardly more than short summarys.
“We have brought Hitler to power with this type of Izolacionism,” John McCain, the opponent of Ron Paul, who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one of the participants in the circle.
Romney’s head is thoroughly washed by the Vietnam veteran, when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called ‘Waterboarding’ as torture, the method of interrogation in which water is simulated.
However, the important topics of the campaign are beyond the debate on Iraq and torture, it is shown by the reactions of the audiences of St. Petersburg in Florida.
Sound taps break out in the room when the conservative values are rejected by the praiseer and the future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are becoming more and more vulnerable.
“I was wrong in the past,” said Romney, and apologizes to the supporters and television viewers for putting the Voksa down in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is eager to ask for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after the withdrawal from the army, there was a fall in power in Pakistan as President Musharraf.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf had a further five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamic presidential palace.
Musharraf swore on the Constitution and that his people would do well.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed the international pressure from the United States to come before everything.
After eight years of the time, the former General reigned in the form of a military coup, in the form of a coup, as the head of state for the first time.
Musharraf, acting as Chief Commander of Armed Forces, has fulfilled a fundamental demand for the West and the opposition.
Another important requirement is the termination of the extraordinary condition announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to chief prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will eliminate the extraordinary state of the West after a fall.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf planted legal lawyers who were simulating him at the beginning of November, has rejected all kinds of protests last week in connection with the re-election of the Head of State of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, as a result of an attack against a military convoyant in the North, five soldiers were killed and four more injured.
According to the information provided by the military spokesman, the bomb exploded near the Afghan border.
Fathers of the crater can return
The German Super Team in the 1970s: The three band members of Harmony reselled their instrument to the power of a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the reconciliation from their light age, the “Live 1974” time shows a cut recording.
At that time, they were much more familiar abroad.
The declared sensation was carried out by three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each of them is its own instrument, its own cable and all its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius in the middle of the snow white shirt with his 63 years.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is young in the age of 57, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the audience to the right, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, as well as rhythm once and for all.
This is sometimes a traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother the masters in particular.
It was a great excitement for those who like the krautrock musical direction that Harmony was playing music again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can find that the name has passed through the collective pop memory, but in no case has left any permanent traces of this band painfully missing after 32 years.
But why can’t the Germans celebrate the living legends of their seventy years?
In particular, what we call a misguided crater has always been more appreciated in England and America than in his own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Life in 2003 to the members of the Kölni Can group, the German pops sat in the room with an unconscious face.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers had even thanked the La Dysseldorf and the Neu! groups, the admiration became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Roth was sitting with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old buddy.
The two sides of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are the same.
Harmony is only overextracting the memory because the trio existed for only two years, and in this time it had far less effect than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius played music with Conrad Schnitzler before under the much promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in a basement under Schaubüyne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company funded by the Church.
Roth helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and, in parallel, it may be the most radical German band, the Neu! guitarist.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century novel lived as a comedian from the city.
Less ideologically than in the I. commune, where Roedelius was still a baby-sitter.
Their life is more of an idyllic art.
The flag of Harmonia Ottenstein's song, and this is how they found a name for their art.
Some things have been recorded by Harmony.
The first album is \"Musik von Harmonia\" and \"De Luxe \"
Despite its loose and modest music, the band suffered material needs.
The stock collection alone did not guarantee the discovery of itself.
The CD released in the title of “Live 1974” was taken up at a concert in Grissem, in front of a small number of 50 record audiences, so someone remembers.
Harmony’s efforts and occasional practice were then an idea of Roth.
This is an immoral claim for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced its division in 1975.
Roth made up of his esoterics and held himself from albums like “Flammende Herzen”
Clubert has been relived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
The live album in Glasgow is due to Herbert Gronemeyer.
His record company in Greenland aimed to take care of the crater as a special German attachment to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been buried as well as the work of Roedelius.
Harmony's resurrection takes place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of our British ancestor and “Krautrock Sampler” manual.
Also present is the idea owner of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This draws the impact of the craterrock to the next pop music era.
In this regard, Harmony fills the empty space for the Super Team.
Brian Eno writes with the most unusual voices in the room: “The only true music, his future,
There are pictures of the producer in Harmony in a peasant's room.
The introduction of additional black and white photos of the cable equipment in the yard serves the legendary construction.
In the first place, the three veterans are reinvented with improvisation.
This only makes it possible to record microphones for the organ and drum equipment with the intention that the instruments themselves have not yet heard sound effects by means of sound effects.
Today, electrical music seems to be electrical music.
Three, technique deep-cracker.
Even the house doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern’s direction, they cough and kiss, and they sing with a beautiful part of the feeling “Aaaaaaah.”
The crater has always been a very English concept.
He never told me about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone is crying \"68\", they don't go on the wrong road, and Harmony won't even let themselves out of his rest.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully reconsidered on the stage.
Where does music start and where does it end?
This can prevent a person from being upset, or you can give it to him with exceptional moments of luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
Through the “Warship and the “Mörderischer Frieden”, two films are re-experienced with the Balkan War.
But none of them are convincing.
The idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Richard Gere himself can’t help in the “Warning.”
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, they found him again in the dark back of the Bosnian war, Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, as many good-boy-sexing roles played in women's emotional films and a lot of press conferences on Buddhism have taken our pleasure even to look at them.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument to see the “Warning” movie.
It’s a wonderful, smiling design: basically, Simon Hunt’s military scientist, which Gere could have become if the fate and film industry were not so graceful: a man who left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline as a corrupt monument, retained a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the film “Mörderischer Frieden” and also released this week continues the endless series of broken films on the Balkan war.
“Mörderischer Frieden – we don’t have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from Kosovo’s assassins, and one of them suddenly loves her as a add-on.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not portrayed as the only cause of all the evil, the film that carries the vulnerability of television films is too quickly lost in shooting and event scenes.
\"Cobra has 11-marks - instead of a highway with war.
On the other hand, in the case of “Warship,” it is possible to examine why not even a really good film of the Balkan war has actually been made.
The three U.S. military scholars who come up to investigate the Serbian war criminal, other director (both Richard Shepard's personal union) in a different age, could have become a new \"Apocalypsis now\".
For the stories show surprising similarities: In both cases, small groups cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable to do – and in both cases, the journey of madness is rotating.
One of the reasons for the fall of “Walking” is that Simon Hunt simply does not allow him to be a cynicist who listens to his heart as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and as part of the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a woman who was murdered later.
The “Warning,” when the reporters, in the last five minutes of the film, reach what NATO, CIA, and all the world’s head hunters have not been able to catch the war criminals, they will then hand him over to the Mohamedan Bosnians for fair revenge.
It's so bad that you're most likely to turn to the Hague International Court for the crime committed against the logic of the cinema.
The film is designed deeply human.
He intends to claim that Karajics and Mladics are still on the loose and suspect the Americans and the French (i.e., exceptionally united) that, due to secret political deals, persecution is not being carried out intensively.
But the good and evil sometimes resemble each other so much that a famous Brecht-verb comes to mind.
This poet writes of the Asian demon on his desk: “I’m looking at the dylant on a fishbed, which says, “What a pestilence to be bad.”
Films such as “Warning” have the same oversized, human-headed masks, which show how frustrating it is to be.
This problem is limited not only to the genre of the films on the Balkan War.
They recently reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films on Iraq were a mess.
There is no good South Africa movie yet.
Almost always valid: If a star wanders in the world’s crisis logs or mine fields, then it’s like “The Ways of Freedom” – Patricia Arquette, “With the Hats – Angelina Jolie or the “Verous Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
These conflicts may be too close to time.
For decades they had to spend while Hollywood was able to film a good film from the Holocaust with the \"Schindler list\" film.
Some of the films are likely to come in – because the works of the Vietnam War today, such as “The Hornet,” “Apocalypse now,” or “Full Metal Jackett” were not celebrated as a masterpiece in their time.
But it is possible that today, when all mass murders come in real time, they come to our home through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And this deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
In the end, Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you should not strive for good if you want to make a good film.
Maybe we need to put the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in his sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When the historical novel of the Lemprière-lexicon and the parallels between the Balkan War fell on him, he replied: “This only depends on certain things never change.
The big cities will always be so dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and in Yugoslavia there will always be war.
Von Beustot is critically criticized for the withdrawal of the Olympics.
The Mayor's decision to hold the Olympic Games in Hamburg in the summer of the summer has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue fighting for water games.
Von Beust, however, is strongly warned about reality in the course of the odds.
On Wednesday, the head of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, considered the withdrawal to be unfavorable for the \"economic environment\".
No other project has recently released such huge motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we can’t keep the sport momentum in a balanced way.
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative \"which starts with modified time coordinates\".
In addition to his earlier statements by Mayor von Beust, his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not realistic until at least 2028.
“It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He took the decision of the Sports Association at the beginning of December 2018 on the Munich competition for the Winter Olympic Games.
“This preference means that we will not have real chances within the period up to 2028 that we have been thinking about.
However, we do not give up the dream, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over the statements of von Beust.
This is the impression that Hamburg will not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early for us to fail an opportunity to bury our plans now,” Günter Ploß said on Wednesday, President of HSB.
The withdrawal from the competition is contrary to the statement by the Senate president at the reception of the General German Sports Association.
There, Von Beust Hamburg, the 2015 Universziadéra, was characterized by the fact that it was not a substitute for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The College Sports Association has only started Hamburg as a participating city in the competition last week.
The SPD Civil Group has drawn up the Senate’s failure to take advantage of valuable time in terms of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been slowing down for years since the Olympics were occupied and the building was abandoned,” said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit, and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break the lead alongside an integrated plan for Olympic and later home use for Kleiner Grasbrook, CDU unilaterally placed the emphasis on the \"event factor\".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games were presented with great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was lost in Liptchen.
They're not Warhol's flames.
The one who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wall to each other is Ikea and does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
There are currently walls manufactured in Sweden to list the works of Warhol.
The ninety-four-type Stockholm-Brillo Box is a counterfeit.
After a few months of questioning the originality of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes in 1968, the internal investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet came to a illustrious conclusion: In 1995, Pontus Hultén, the former museum director of Moderna Museet, a copy of the six \"Brillo Box\", and most likely a hundred more \"Stockholm-type Box\" on the international art market.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and pioneering performances.
Warhol, in 1964, created the first “Brillo Boxai” - painted walls based on a red-and-white form of the “Brillo” soap powder cardboard box.
In 1968, hundreds of the Brilllo bridges made from the map of moderna Museet, Warhol, were made up of his works: They were not from Warhol for reasons of cost savings, but were delivered directly from the Brillo-carton factory.
It wasn't about artworks, it was about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol issued permission to manufacture some of the Brillo villages in Sweden in 1968, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age now speak round of fifteen crates that, at the time, have been certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation \"Stockholm-type\", were entitled to the art and auction history.
Some of them were priced for more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later said that in 1968, a hundred walls were produced and produced in Sweden, which he then left on Warhol.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in Saint-Petervár.
Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main monument of Moderna Museet, looked at three boxes of private property in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The premiered forks were first cut and cut off, followed by a brush of white oil paint.
The structure of the copies from 1990 is telling us that the paint was taken directly to the screen without foundation - it is not about oil, it is about acrylics.
“These boxes are not authenticated by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes,” says Lars Nitve, Director of Moderna Museet: “Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentation Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will be classified as a copy/output material in its collection.
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it was investigating the “serious accusations” raised in relation to soap-sported crates.
Since then, however, they have been eavesdropping into inquisitive silence.
The rebels in Manila give up
The rebellion in the Philippines was abandoned by soldiers who barricaded themselves at a Manila hotel and called for the capture of President Gloria Macaugal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he told reporters at the hotel's leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was bombarded by military soldiers who took a light gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricaded in the building for hours.
Half of the team stood before the court on Thursday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to solve suddenly wheels with 30 sympathisms.
The military police that was responsible for the man's guard obviously moved to him and joined the song.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel, and then called for the arrest of President Gloria Macaugal Arroyo.
Government hall units closed the area of the hotel.
The president called the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales was convicted of the military procedure.
“They have enough for people,” Trillane said.
“We call on people to join us.
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of Scout Rangers, said that other units of the army wanted to join the process in a short time.
Government critics called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been covered by corruption charges for several months.
Manila’s financial district was the main stage in 2003 in the military’s round-the-clock-out-the-clock-out attempt against Arroyo organized by 200 members of the army.
The uprising failed in the past 24 hours when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have been carried out on the Philippines against the democratic elected governments.
The United Internet will be large-scale in Versatel
The United Internet has a share of more than 20% in Versatel’s telecommunications company.
As announced by the company on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14,46 Euro.
This represents 20.05 percent of the underlying capital.
Before the takeover, they had already been found on the wing.
The possibility of raising the property acquired in Versatel remains open.
By this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, the United Internet said.
Prior to this, there were assumptions about a possible connection on Wednesday after the Berenberg Bank increased its share in the dysseldorf network provider by another 5% to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution maintains its share as only a third party, newsing the money market.
On the previous day, the United Internet has already held a limited 10% of the Drillisch mobile phone company.
Within the framework of the capital increase, Drillisch invested 17.4 million new shares in the amount of EUR 106.4 million.
The United Internet has bought EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies have launched a dialogue on cooperation on the placing of DSL and mobile phone products on the market.
“We strengthen our partner relationship,” said a spokesman for United-Internet.
The two companies jointly set up the MSP joint venture for the acquisition of the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with a good 10 percent share in Freenet and do not have the right to take over 18.49 percent of Freenet, the United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave every opportunity open, especially to raise their share in the Freenet AG, the news says.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet has been a part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile phones and 1,27 million customers with DSL and wire access.
The holding company, created by the United Internet and Drillisch, had a direct 6,01 percent share in Freenet.
It is now agreed that Drillisch will bring an additional four percent.
The agreement on the right to purchase 18.49 percent of Vatas’ investment company was concluded in August.
