Members of Wales are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the House have been confused with the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, namely the member of the Wales Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu began with a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives to the Parliament of Wales.
The members of the Assembly are concerned, regardless of the party, that the change may make them a fool.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned about the fact that the name is ‘rice with the words Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupidity, and pwp means cocoa.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is not satisfied and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative Party representative, his group reacts to the change of name “open mind,” but notes that the MWP is a short verbal spell for stupidity.
The W-book in Wales is similar to that in Yorkshire’s English.
The Commission, which is currently drawing up the legislative amendment necessary for the name change, stated as follows: \"The final decision on the titles of the members of the representative belong to the members themselves of course.
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gives the representative the authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on proposals stating that the appointment of a representative to the Parliament of Wales enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured the members of the Board of Representatives to be the title of the Wales Parliament or to shorten the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the Parliament will obviously propose alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may lead to a major shift in President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose a legislative amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the activities of the representative, such as the loss of the representative's action and the rules on the format of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly may give their final vote on the title of which they should be called.
The people of Macedonia go to the electoral council in a referendum on the modification of the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the name of the country is changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the conflict with Greece, which has been called Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the Northern Neighbor is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership efforts.
President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev consider that the change in the name is simply the price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins' clocks shut down when the Churches of Harlem live in difficult times
“The older people I have talked to say that before every street corner was a bar or church,” Adams said.
“There is no one now.
He said the loss of the bars is understandable.
He said, “The relationship with men has changed.”
Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighbourhood, where people meet regularly.
In the case of Churches, he is concerned that the sale of assets does not take as far as the leaders imagine, “and sooner or later they have returned to the starting line.”
He added that churches can be replaced with residential houses and apartments that are inhabited by people are not those who would support the saints remaining behind the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will be forced to close their doors forever, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these rooms will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by the White Churches before Harlemia became a Black House - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original White Methodist Society moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired a building.
St Martins took over the black-haired congregation under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the 125th Street traders in Harlem's main trade street.
In 1939, a burning fire damaged the building badly. When Father Johnson’s parishes designed to rebuild, they introduced a tower watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower watch.
In July, an expert called it another name: \"cultural treasure - and \"unreplaceable historical instrument\".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also pointed out that it was the world's first black musician to play a tower watch game. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Meriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, in recent months, there has been a complex misconception involving architects and contractors hired by the governors of the church and the episcopal strip.
As a result, the governing body consisting of the governors of the congregation, wrote to the hippo in July his free concern that the guerrilla-principal circle would take the cost to the drawer, even though the saw did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the archbishop.
Some congregation members complained about lack of transparency in the field of soup.
The shark hurt 13-year-old hummer divers in California
The authorities tell us that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him when he dived into the boy on the opening day of the humanitarian season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before dawn.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB to dive with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and the group ate the boy to help this water.
Hammel first said he thought that the boy was just excited when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, \"I was bitten.
I was bitten!”
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he's noticed that this whole syllable had been torn open.
“I asked everyone to leave the water: There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to a children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attack is unknown.
In a media conference, my breathguard captain Larry Giles said that the area had been detected for a few weeks before, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles increased the victim's serious injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed the beaches from the Ponto Beach of Casablanca to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for scientific and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's is going to the UK Beauty Hospital
Saisbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a commercially-friendly beauty care department serving expert advisors.
This is a significant movement for a beauty care facility worth £2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which will continue to grow, although the sale of fashion and home resources will deteriorate. More beauty care departments will be tried in 11 stores across the country and will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and home resources.
Sainsbury's tells the range of beauty care products to double 3 000 products, with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Available brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific locations like Boots stores.
Supermarket also re-launchs its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will try rentals in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the other will be opened in Sally Oaki Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to close-up shops forces supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Saisbury's, said that stores will look even more like supermarkets when the supermarket chain fights against cheap shops like Aldin and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Saintsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and in addition to the Habit shops. The company says this has contributed to the sale of food and has made it profitable for the purchase.
Supermarket failed in its previous company to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Saisbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute on how to share the profits of a pharmacy in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows a business store where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan that extends four stores to a range of luxurious skin care products by markings like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial leader of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care department to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in workers who have received a special qualification, ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meet all the needs and attractive environments and convenient locations make us a convincing shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of doing shopping.
Peter Jones – Holly Willoughby
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his ships when TV driver Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million-pound contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home food and apartment brand Truly.
Two companies have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old runner of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby kissed Dragons Den by Peter Jones by retreating from their productive lifestyle business in the last minute. He is now going to focus on his new jackpot agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell Jones that he had been on his own ships – last Tuesday at a tense meeting held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshir. The stargirl had admitted that his new 1.5 million pounds would not leave enough time for Truly, their home food and apartment brand.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was cut off from the double Willoughby’s estimated 11 million pounds of property.
At his 37-year-old Willoughby's announced Instagram, he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain from one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, “Truly was the most important project in Holly’s life.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his life for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everything to the power of surprise.
No one had faith in Tuesday events so close to the release.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale.
This Morning is one of the most secure stars in the UK, and according to experts, its departure can cause a million losses to the company due to product placements, including all pillows and clothes on home supplies, not to mention the delay of the publication.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her spouse Dan Baldwin have been ten years close to Jones and this wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is baked from a new brand ambassador to M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin's ITV I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, \"We don't comment on his business...
A little talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that he would receive in the media about his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the President, and his support for the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a newsman, a voice.
“I didn’t give up at all.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had made the first meeting in July a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear isolation.
However, nuclear negotiations have become apace.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see a similar reaction from the United States to the early armed activities of North Korea.
Instead, he said that the United States would continue its sanctions for which pressure should be maintained.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“It’s going to be great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were in war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
He said the efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been terminated, the hostages have been helped with freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this spot, we would have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, showing the audience in front of it.
Indonesia's tsunami and strike destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, a number of foreign volunteers were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of the residents of Lombok had remained homeless.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children form a travel group, it is not certain whether a foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the National Disaster Officer, said the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation to see whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia continues to complain of unprepared natural forces, taking into account regularly repeated earthquakes.
Although Acehiin has built tsunami salts, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost in humans due to a missing tsunami warning line, even though the warning was in force.
Traveling between numerous islands in Indonesia is challenging under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on the way to Return, but it takes at least three days before it reaches a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia at the centre of his electoral campaign, and he has allowed money to improve roads and railways.
However, the government of the river has struggled with the financial deficit, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted the older form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have been fighting streets with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons. This has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.

Daniel Sturrridge saved Liverpool's defeat on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturrridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's painting, when his team was in a goal-loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before he choked the shot towards the back to the top.
The shot was cut above the high penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball fell over the hurdle of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.

On Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported an earthquake and tsunami deaths to 832 victims.
Sutopo Purwo, a reporter at the press conference, said that many had been trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, when the 7,5 magnitude earthquake hit Friday and raised up up to six meters of high-level waves.

Mr Cromwell's statue was involved in the rewriting of history.
It would be a poetic right to leave the statue, given that his own fanatical puritanist destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Taliban.
Cromwell-seura described Crick’s proposal for rewriting of the history and philosophy.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make the painting of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoques of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the works of his previous ancestor Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s great description of Cromwell manifests the opinions of the 19th century and is a historical proof of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, although perhaps more in the 1800s than today, Cromwell, as a defender of Parliament, is against external pressure, which, of course, caused monarchy.
Whether it is a precise description of the subject, it is a subject of continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that the dispute in the middle of the 16th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation. Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified by a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state nurse deserve praise and memory.
The killer shatters the Chinese farmer's death
The local media report an attack on the farmer and killed him on a tower in the Lounais-China.
Only the body of the identified man was found near the pig at the Liupanshui Tower in Guizhou County. The man's artery had been cut off and he was on top of the blood, South China Morning Post said Sunday.
The Sikopami is preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs in the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province in China.
He was reported with his cousin on Wednesday from the nearby Yunna County to sell 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning.
In the pig, he said he saw a big scream with a mouth in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal technical investigation confirmed the death of a 250-pound fur farmer.
Guiyang Eventing News says “My cousin, Wu,” said, “my cousin’s feet were bloody and rubbed.
The surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving on the tower to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man's killed pig didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the tower told the Evening News that the pig had been locked behind the locks so that it would not harm other police in collecting evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the office are told to negotiate compensations for death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, who suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 kilos climbed against this tractor by a farmer of Wales until his wife managed to blow up the animal's path.
The Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012 after the event in Manitoba, the farmer told the CBC News channel that, although pigs are not usually aggressive, blood taste can act as a ‘bread’.
They're just toys.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All you have to do is respect them properly, he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains bring extensive heavy rains to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to deteriorate when moving over the coolest waters of the North Coast of Mexico.
However, in the near future, Rosa brings floods to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
The wind speed was 38 metres per second, i.e. the first grade hurricane, the fifth east coast on Sunday, and it was located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-water formation that is heading east toward the western coast of the United States. When the rose to the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to bite deep tropical moisture north of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain into some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity that is interacting with the approaching low material forms large rainy areas for lunch in the next few days.
Locally 25-100 millimeters rainfalls cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes a rainfall of 50-75 millimeters per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain regions in lunch, and in particular Arizona, up to 50-100 millimeters of rain are expected.
Hard rainfalls are possible and conditions can be quickly weakened due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When the tropical rain is threatened, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
Hard rains can turn canons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms produce local windmills and flying dust.
The nearby lowland area brings local heavy rains to the coastlines of South California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the area.
The scattered tropical rainstorms begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last for the entire week.
In October, the United States can see a lot of intense resuscitations throughout the temperatures when the Arctic area cools down, but when the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature reflections at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, we see an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines is almost 20 degrees.
The heat in the summer will try again to grow and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be widely warm in the middle and east of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees from the south to the north.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday at +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast is that in the East of the United States there are good opportunities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Mr Kavanaugh's consultation.
More than 20 million people watched the six television channels on Tuesday, where the Supreme Court's judge, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, and Christine Blasey Ford, who was responsible for sexual crime in the 1980s, gave his testimony.
At the same time, when television companies were suspended, the political situation continued with a recent reverse that the FBI carried out a week of investigation on the charges of the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, on the basis of a contract organised by Dr. Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that he was 100% sure that he had been beaten by Kavanaugh and tried to take his clothes off in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
The viewers were likely to have more than 20.4 million announced on Friday by Nielsen.
The company dropped the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers of other channels sent, such as PBS, C-Spanish and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has often difficulty measuring viewers looking at offices.
Some of the proportions tell us that the reading corresponds to the number of American football drop-offs or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, with an average of 5.69 million viewers on the Channel throughout the day's consultation.
ABC was the second with a 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, the interest was still high.
In the middle of the Friday drama was Flake.
CNN's and CBS cameras described how the protestor's screams sent him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday. The background forces of the Maltical Republican had previously announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN looked straight at how he was standing at a minute shop watching down the phone flying.
“Seven right in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he will tell the people the truth?
“You have power when so many women are invincible,” he said.
Flake said his office had given an opinion and added that he would have more to be told after consultation of the committee.
A few hours later, cable and public broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate's plenary session.
However, Flake said he was only working in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced by his friend, a democratic engineer with Chris Coons, on the basis of the discussions he had.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people of politics criticizing his EU differences, which threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May’s interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May’s so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the proposal that Britain and the EU would be perpetuating each other’s import duties,” he said.
Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person as a suspect in LSU, playing for the 20-year-old Wayde Sims's death-leading shooting.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, accused of murdering another degree.
The authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's inter-review, where the police are telling Sims that he's drowning his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, WAFB says.
The police tell us Simpson gave a shot at Wayden in interrogations.
His guarantee amount was set at US$350,000 according to the Advocate magazine.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge County Researcher published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a shooting in the neck.
The Agency is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Police team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the community's residents for assisting the investigation led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the leader of LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for these news and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
On average, he wrote 5.6 points and 2.6 songs in the game last year.
The LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that he was “difficult and shocked – of Wayden’s death.
“You’re always afraid of something like this,” Wayde said.
The volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexiko.
On Saturday, Mexico’s disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay far from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and during the day, 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered.
The Centre registers grains and vibrations several times.
In social media, images were released, where in areas like Xochimilco, Mexico City, the windshields of cars covered a thin ash layer.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano from the capital to the south of the city, 72 kilometres after Mexico was fed by 7.1 magnitude earthquakes in September 2017.
“The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Political and Catalan separatists will be bringing together before the anniversary of the independence vote.
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday in the assembly of protestors and melccapolis in favour of independence. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the dissentary vote.
Police arrested a group of masked self-determination supporters who threw the police with eggs and powder paints that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the day, there were more mules when the police used their bulbs to control the nuns.
The combinations between the supporters of independence and the groups of Unionists continued for several hours, when the previous cry, “no forget, no forgiveness, and the latter, let Spain live.”
The local journal tells us that fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries in protests.
The tension is still on the ground in an area that supports independence one year after the referendum on 1 October, declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence with a clear majority, even though participation was low in the opposing boycotts voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the last year’s violent confrontations when police tried to prevent voting in polling locations across the region.
The independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent the national police from supporting the protest.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electric man who attended separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we experienced one of the best moments in our lives.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck in places,” he says.
In the last December regional elections, however, the pace of the parties supporting Catalonia's independence has slowed this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in a voluntary exile or arrested waiting for a trial on their part to be part of the referendum and the resulting independence statement.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a police-friendly demonstration on his phone, says that on both sides of the politicians, the flames are controversial.
“You’re getting blackmailed all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in prison until the last nine years, announced his participation in the European Parliamentary elections next year.
“To become a European candidate is the best way to condemn the deterioration and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested in a car crash house
Men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after the car was repeatedly reported to the house in Londonderry.
The events took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and buildings were damaged.
A car might have been shot at at some point in the middle of the road.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 with Mengan
Dolly Mengan's first goal in Livingston was to ensure victory.
Livingston was shocked by Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard to lose the second in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox series.
Dolly Menga’s goal was finally won by Gary Holt’s team in the second place with Hibernia.
Gerrard's crew remained without the first guest win of the season in Premiership. Next, it will meet the serial director Hearst, eight points ahead.
Rangers will meet in the European League of Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston continued to fall in the series for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places to a friend who was in need of steel.
The Holt team should have led long before his goal had caused the Rangers a lot of trouble in their supremacy.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and the next thing Alan Lithgow got to slide off the ground floor, Craig Hallet's bumping, but directed past the ball.
The hostess gave up the ball management to Rangers because they knew they could be vaccinated about special situations.
An important painting came this way.
Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Mengala, where he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
Rangers had kept the ball by then, but said the home team was defending, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow directed the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
In addition, the concentration of livingston's punishment area was constantly cleaned out. In addition, two of the situations were called for an unnecessary penalty kick - a low-cost exchanger from Glenn Middleton and a ball hit by his hand.
Great performance from Livingston - Analysis
the BBC Scotland Alaskair Lamont Tony Macron
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the rise lines.
The team's gameplay and the crew have hardly changed since its rise back to the highest serial level. However, we have to give holt recognition of the way he has strengthened the team after he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great leader in a well-organized defense, while Mengan was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to the whole game.
But Rangers didn't have ideas.
The team has been very well under Gerrard from time to time, but is now far from his requirement level.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once. This should act as a awakening to Rangers, which is the middle of the series table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne
Hymy was in a delicate and sky blue on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit to NATO, which aims to improve NATO relations.
There have been differences in human rights and freedom of the press as well as in Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The largest Turkish population in the city is outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, setting it up for security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters to look at the president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - also brought their voices to the members, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the ground.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, some German Turkish greeted him as a hero in the defeats of others as a sovereign.

Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in restlessness
Prison officials report the high security classification of injured men in prisons of six prisoners.
The distributions began at the HMP Long Lart in Worcestershire around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, Britain’s time continued and continued.
They have brought the Tornado Special Police to calm down the restlessness behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The police were treated with minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison nurse said: “HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a special-trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and they may have to spend longer behind the calories.
The HMP Long Lart Prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alarmed because of serious restlessness in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings a heavy rainfall threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the drought areas can benefit)
Arizona rarely receives tropical mats, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of the next week when the remains of the Hurricane Rosa move over the lunch Eve, bringing along the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already provided a warning of heavy rainfalls on Monday and Tuesday from Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, South Caucasus and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rains.
Phoenix’s National Weather Service noted in his tweet that only ten tropical hurricanes have retained a tropical storm or low-water space within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest designs of the National hurricane centre predict 50-100 millimeters of rainfalls. On the Mogollin ridge in Arizona, up to 150 millimeters can rain in place.
In other regions of the southwest desert, including the middle cliff mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres can be found, with a total of up to 100 millimeters.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing to drought by testing the area if there is no danger of heavy rainfalls.
Although floods cause a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful, because of the severe drought in the south lunch.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first make her journey to the country on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Sunnuntaiamuna Rosa is located 620 km south of Punta Eugena in Mexico. It is still the hurricane’s strong wind speed at 135 km per hour. It moves north at an hour speed of 20 km.
The storm loses its power when faced with cooler waters in the Pacific Sea.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during the day or evening of the tropical storm.
In Mexico, the rains can be rough and cause a significant flood risk.
“From the Peninsula of California, the Northwest Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible,” says Weather.com.
Rosa then goes on her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before she arrives at Arizona border as a tropical matator on Tuesday morning hours. From there it will continue to travel through Arizona to southern Utah by late.
“The biggest risks of Rosa or its remains are associated with very heavy rains in the California Peninsula, Northwest Sonora, and the U.S. southwest desert,” the National hurricane agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfalls and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The young boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning morning from Britain’s time.
He was taken to a hospital where he was told to be in a safe state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
The police will ask for contact with anyone who may have video material stored on the mobile phone for events.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced a democratic party, an evil and anger.
“My husband, in favour of Kavanaugh, is a voice against the indiscriminate and shameful methods of the democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheelling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was suffering from the expression and anger of the Democratic Party – throughout his terming process.
Kavanaugh proved to be in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasay Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which would have happened decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also proved his accusations in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, nature and courage – that day.
“My husband, in favour of strengthening the name of Kavanaugh, has a voice for one of the most qualified legal students of our time with excellent seas for public service,” he told his supporter of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when speaking about the importance of Republicans’ voting activity in the foreign elections.
“We’re five weeks away from our most important elections during our lifetime.
Not just a campaign, but a campaign full, he said.
“That’s why I go all the way to fight for excellent candidates.
Trump claimed to have taken on the role of the Democrats to be responsible and preventative.
The senior assistant of the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote of the Kavanaugh appointment procedure is expected to be held at the Senate by Friday.
In Indonesia earthquake and tsunamis, hundreds of dead, the number of deaths is expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 dead large earthquakes and tsunami attacks on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped off along with the giant waves that hit the shores.
Please to the festival on the city beach, hundreds of people gathered on Friday, when the waves of up to six metres high hit the beach in the evening of the storm. Many were drowning in the destruction of the waves.
Tsunam caused the powerful earthquakes of 7.5 Magnituds.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not immediately flee, when they remained victim to it,” says the Indonesia Department for the Prevention of Major Accidents in Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but it carried cars, wooden tires, houses, and struck all over the country,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami reached an hourly speed of 800 miles in the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami in their lives by climbing to trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The weather images published by the Disaster Agency appear to be a number of destroyed houses and shops, curved and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The trails continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were in the area where 2.4 million people lived.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPT issued an opinion stating that the energy released in Friday’s vast earthquake was about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima in the second World War.
It says that the mountain of the long and narrow bay could be heated by tsunamis.
Nugroho described the destruction as a “blower,” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been broken.
He told some of the bodies of the victims about the ruins of the oppressed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death victims and that the damage might be greater than the Palusta 300 km north along a continuous coast, in a region called Donggara, which is closer to the center of the lake.
Communication connections are completely out of reach, and no information has been received from Donggala,” Nugroho says.
According to the opinion of the Red Cross, more than 30,000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the region.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday that it did not tell the tsunami to hit the fire, though the authorities said during the launch of the waves.
In the social media, a man in the upper floor of the building screams with a lot of warnings for people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach will be hit by a water wall that will take buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electrical circuit that disrupted communications connections Please around. This hampered the coordination of authorities' rescue operations.
The authorities tell us that the army has begun to send assistance from Jakarta and other cities with transportation machines, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basics.
The city airport has been reopened only for aid measures and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was supposed to visit the Espä evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff has reached security in the city where they have been housed in the interior yard of the office for a tent fabric. On their journey, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is really bad.
When the relief groups started their unsatisfied mission, some complained that foreign relief workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the provisions of Indonesia, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to flow when the emergency area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the county level,” says Aulia Arrian, a reporter from the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, “OK, this is a national disaster, we can begin to receive international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made.
When the second night landed, please, after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members who were missing had the hope that their loved ones would, by miracle, deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised from the drain.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of Indonesia's independent union team, had trained two missing independents for the Asian races that ended this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandagi.
“As a senior member of the League, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says he tried desperately to reach out to those who participated in the beachfestival, and to compete with WhatsApp, after news about the oppression of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel spread among the independence community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blues.
“I understand that the messages were not sent,” he said.

Kanye West: The rapper changes the name Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes the name Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote: “The character that was previously known as Kanye West.
Ye has been the nickname of the 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as his eighth album published in June.
The change is preceded by his upcoming appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yanth.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the programme creator, withdrew his participation for the practical reasons.
West has previously said that the word also has religious significance for him, not only that it is short of his professional name.
Talking about the title of the album earlier this year with the radio driver Big Boy, West said, “he believes that ‘ye’ is the most common word of the Bible, and there is the meaning of the Bible.
“I am you, we, and we all.
It began with Kany, which means the only thing, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which only manifests the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is primarily a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is widely known for the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year his favorite names for Love and Brother Love.
The former partner of West, JAY-Z, has also removed and restored the line and the big letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came at the age of 50.
Lopez Obrador, who was on Saturday at Tlatellolco Plaza, promised that “there would be no use of an army for the repression of the Mexican people.”
The armed forces attacked peaceful protests on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were entering Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and opening up additional free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities is driving young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The US should double the funding it uses to investigate artificial intelligence when China enhances its operations. This is how Google, Microsoft and Apple are working with a financier and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications concerning the various parts of the U.S. administration’s artificial intelligence, even though the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it seeks to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doublening of the budget of the research in the field of research is a good start when it is taken into account that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Simplifying funding could double the probability that the next major artificial intelligence would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee's book \"The Great Powers of Teko Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face+.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the U.S. top-ranked Othello player. Later he worked in Microsoft Research’s managerial positions and as the leader of Google Chinese operations.
Lee recognized the former technology competitions of the U.S. administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. scientists have worked hard to get public support.
“Academatic influencers don’t take China, but big companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting universities’ tops in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to enhance their efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think those who complete a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should automatically admit green cards,” he said.
The Chinese Government’s next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The U.S. Department of Defence was established earlier this year by the Defense Department Joint Cultural Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together the partners of the world of industry and academics. The White House has also announced the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
In turn, NSF invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
The Macedonian referendum on the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country, the Republic of Pohjois-Madedonia, to resolve the change of name with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO for decades.
In the view of Greece that owns the province of Macedonia, the name of the Northern Neighbourhood is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory, and has therefore opposed its access to EU-NATO membership.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but in the opinion of nationalist opponents, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he is not going to vote in a referendum, and the campaign against vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity reaches the threshold of 50% required to be legal.
The question in the vote was: \"Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, agreeing to the agreement with Greece -
The supporters of the name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price should be paid so that Macedonia as to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The name change requires a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities were reported by 13:00.
However, the vote was only 16 compared to 34% of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the voters finally voted.
“I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in the referendum on the name change in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set the chairs in front of the boycotted tents in front of the Skopje Parliament.
“We are running NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up and not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us in Macedonia, we can turn to another country, such as China and Russia as part of the euro area integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring the lost investments in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“In favour of the change in the name of a large majority, as more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said \"yes,\" that our future is growing.
The poll, published on Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, referred to 30-43% voting activity in the referendum - i.e. under the required activity.
57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday in another survey by Telma TV in Macedonia.
Of them, 70% said they would vote for the yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious return to the Western government after its rise in power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beat the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense at the Manchester City 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made it look ridiculous.
At the beginning of the graph, the Argentine top player was fed from the middle of the field.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found it surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed away from one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's punishment zone.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who bypassed the Brighton-Veht Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot on the right corner.
City Manageri Pep Guardiola told reporters that \"Aguero has problems with his feet...
“We talked that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a goal in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the celestial advantage in the election campaign.
The painting came on the 29th game.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful feed on the left side.
Sane took a few contact before sending the ball back to Sterling.
The sky's attack just before the end of the game.

Scherzer wants to be a fan of the game against the Rockies.
Nationals is out of the drop-down fight, so why did I try to get into the start-up group?
At the same time, Scherzer hopes to take the bait rubber in the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a drop-off. They have one win in the West Series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies at least got a wild card from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division win.
“Although we don’t have a bet, at least we can get up to the bait, knowing that the atmosphere of the public and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competition that I’ve faced this year.
Why don't I want to face the challenge?
Nationals have not yet published their beginner on Sunday, but according to information, they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training period on Thursday, playing at the start of his 34th game and feeding on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-hand player has a 18-7 win/loss ratio during this period. ERA statistics are 2.53 and has burned the bat 300 times, with a pair of statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to his Supreme Court judge, Mr Kavanaugh's situation, while speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the elections.
“All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big -- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I circle everywhere to fight for excellent candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you will see it happening right now.
They have decided to go back to the whale, with whatever means, to see their abominations and their evils.
They do not choose who is harmful, or who must be steeped, to gain power. That is what they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the democratic people had taken the task of being responsible and preventing them.
“And it has been seen in the past four days,” he said, calling Democrats “green and mean and evil and false.”
In his reference to the most influential democratic engineer of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, Diane Feinstein, the public responded with loud buds.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you have a document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm waiting a little -- it was really bad for the body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer an acceptable congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I’m not really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported the distrust clause against me.
At least I'm the last person to be the last representative of the journal Labour to whom I'm told I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the statement of confidence was critical of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, irony, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labur meeting noted that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
Most of the eight years that I have served as a local representative of Labour have been on Fridays of the Party Council.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and – more friendly and gentler – the policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates different opinions, and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect from me a full turn and views that I would never have agreed otherwise, whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a string of insults in social media, which requires the withdrawal of my choice, the rejection of a central policy, and I can hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
It's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have addressed are of a political nature.
I very much respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day, and never go down.
Normalisation of calculus is one of the most disruptive aspects of the policy of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party adopt the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every distrust clause or change of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “all things are going well.”
But that's not why I left politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure to complete the Thai Government’s uniform school, I have been both city councillors and ministers’ duties to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my point of view or differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards a Brexit that is harmful to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable in Ayr block tip
The last two moments were slightly distorted by the outcome of the match, but Ayr, without denying the victory, earned the day’s entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost any match.
At the end of the day, the excellent defense and more successful risk taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie could be happy for a reason.
“We have been challenged in our matches and we are still invincible, so I can be happy,” he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says: “All the glory of Ayr, they took the risk better than we did.
Ayr went to the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversio kick, but the Scottish captain Roy Hughes' yellow card, who was handed over to Warriors, made it possible for Melrose's rise, and Jason Baggot made the goal.
Climo raised the leadership of the Ayri in punishment paints, and just before half he made the goal and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing the Ayri leadership to the 17-5.
But Melrose started the second lot well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow down to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and was taken out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his leadership with Stafford McDowall's goal, which was managed by Climo.
Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose Bruce Colvine made a goal that was not successful.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the ballless Climon tattoo, and Macpherson made the paint from the bottom of the Ayri maul.
Climo succeeded in the conversio kick in the same way that he had before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and reached Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.

Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, has been appointed as the leader of the licensed restaurant company and will thus start working in the restaurant sector as well.
The 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the 9th season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been designated as the leader of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
\"Meri belongs to us: the inland state Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific Ocean by law.
Seamen are patrolling off the fleet base in La Paz.
The flags of public buildings are subject to a blue flag.
Titicacalta Amazon has been tricked with a hit statement: “The sea is rightly ours.
Getting it back is our duty.
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost in the 19th-century resource war in Chile remains strong – as well as the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest for decades when Bolivia expects a decision from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
“ Bolivia has a strong advancement, a spirit, and a perseverance, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of Bolivians all over the country are looking forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large square, hoping that, at the end of the decade, the Hague will be in favour of a continuous debate, with Bolivia's view that Chile has an obligation to grant independent access to the sea in Bolivia.
With Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces the re-election of the controversial struggle next year, will play a lot in the direction of next Monday.
“The return to the Pacific is very close to the ocean,” he assured the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it were decided, the situation would not change very much.
In addition, ICJ has announced that it will not be able to decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is issued only six months after the last submission of opinions suggests that the case is not complex, says Paz Zrate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than the end of Bolivia.
“The current Bolivian regime has taken the question of sea connection,” Zalate said.
Morales’ argument for challenging rhetoric has been suppressed by the rest of Chileans’ charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and the Bolivian representative in Haag, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the decision of the Court would have been exceptionally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia is an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, and the opportunity to put an end to the differences of 139 years in mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America, would have used the shipping issue as political support.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to connect to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“It is possible to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past...
North Korea announced that there would be no nuclear isolation unless it could be trusted in the United States.
North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons first unless they can rely on Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-launching the U.S. nuclear weapons of U.S. nuclear diplomacy, only three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a long-term dream, believing that the continued sanctions and the US opposition to the Korean War Final Declaration would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures to promote the disarmament of weapons, Washington is under way in the adoption of the Declaration.
Kim, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, wants a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang would be about to abandon the armed arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means to guarantee its own safety, has become a widespread doubt.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Scenes will present the latest collection of large-sized mains, which will soon be in your vicinity.
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
The designers, Valentino and Thom Browne, revealed their SS19 collection of special super-big heads that would dispel the style circles of the Paris fashion weeks.
Very unpractical heads conquered Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion exhibitions as well.
Valentino’s eye-catching creation was a beige hat with a wide-floored seal, covering almost entirely the head of the designs.
Other oversized accessories were, among other things, a watermelon decorated with jewelry stone, a gloomy and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of special masks – just right before Halloween.
In many colorful masks there were omegaly lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One snorkel and masked creature resembled more diving equipment, and the other resembled a sweet ice cream.
And if you want to take a position on behalf of a large-sized fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge heads are appearing in the street.
The oversized hats are closely followed by the shoulder hat with the La Bomba, a half-meter liter, which has been seen in all of Rihana in Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the unconventional, unconventional cultural material of the unconventional hat was also bred in the shape of the second collection of the nature of the moulds – a sandbox made from the shoulder, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The burnt orange necklace with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 design in Paris fashion.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think I’m seeing large-sized hats and wristbags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it’s hard to ignore the demand for large-sized settlements.
John Edward: Language skills are central skills for the world citizen
The studies of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued as a result of good results in 2018. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students from Scotland, represented by the SCIS delegation of private schools in Scotland, aim to provide a high level of service to their students and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, graduate and higher education, as well as world citizenship.
As a training business operator who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and hoped educational material in continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of transparency between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The subject was collected from 74 schools in SCIS. Based on the material, it was found that students who received the best rating A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland will support studying foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-choice substances, but are considered to be of the same value as natural materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private schools’ study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained in incomplete language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote the career development of young people in the future.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills are formed in a global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, despite what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a language person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of adults from more than 4,000 in Isobritan are not able to speak in a foreign language, and France was the only language that was affected by a two-digit number of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is important now for children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing states gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some are specifically teaching languages that are supposed to be important for the Isobritanians in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scotland’s private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
The current languages should indeed be seen as \"international communication skills\".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the SCIS delegation from Scotland's private schools.
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first launch in Los Angeles Lakers' line is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays is left to see.
“It will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
James was asked earlier this week for his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
“At this stage, I don’t need any more pre-games to prepare,” he said.
Trump West Virginia Campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first five elections scheduled for next week, including compassionate items such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his election to fill the free place of the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for future mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing the majority in Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 19 am on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as a live stream through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump takes the position on the hearing of the Supreme Judge of this week, Mr Kavanaugh, who became fiercely accused of sexual harassment, who has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote in the course of the week of the investigation by the FBI.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigners is to support the success of Republican candidates in strict November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of this five-week event, which is to encourage volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so essential that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period,” Trump said.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters from Ohito and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh - West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia during the past month, in a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has remained in polls.
“It is not a good sign from the perspective of Murrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in polls,” said state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team will show the battle to maintain hope before Sunday single games
After a three-sided session, Saturday night four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-confirmed power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, players believe in it, and more in such tournaments.
Where is this power of success now?
“They had a six-point lead, which narrowed to four, so we take this power of success,” Jordan Spieth said when walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, a promotion: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, with which they played all day together and received three points of four.
Spieth has been overwhelmingly green and leads with an example.
The sad sounds of the winning party were enhanced by his tour as he succeeded in a critical tube to offset the match to four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The place where they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry, which gave an idea that he believes that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
“You need to focus very well and only take care of your own match,” Spieth said.
That's the only thing that's left of these players.
18 holes make an impact.
The only players who have received more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four without mistakes.
“Moliwood – was the only pair that didn’t make any bugs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Friday mornings.
That tour, and the way they give and receive energy from this gloomy audience, confirms that they are Sunday pre-sounds. And when the sun falls in Le Golf National, the second preferred player in order to ensure the potential profit of Europe could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time on different holes.
The talks about the success of Europe are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated the competing Sergio Garcia, a four-player hero of the morning.
One bug and two double bogis on the first nine holes mined the Spanish and Swedish so deep that they were not near to survive from there.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-player games are fascinating to follow from the point of view of the partner’s cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead before the last day, but this four-player show that the U.S. team has a battle challenge, even though it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe will take 10-6 leaders before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will be in good leadership before Ryder Cup's last day after they took on Saturday's four-balls and four-to-fourths from the United States.
A great pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a winning process from two winnings from Tiger Woods, and got a score of four points in Le Golf National today.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, which worked hard to maintain two years ago in Hazeltin after losing victory, managed a weakly played U.S. team in the morning’s four-ball, taking the match to the situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday 12th to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called \"Molliwood\", were the second twin in Ryder Cup's history, which has won four points in the first four games.
After breaking down the four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they then completed the overthrow of Woods and U.S. beginner Bryan Dechambeau, even more than 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived through the two matches on Saturday, was at times very great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four games, and up to seven consecutive times.
Justin Rose rested the four-balls of the morning, but returned to the four-game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks to Koepka, who are the first and third in the ranking.
Europe did not get everything in its desired way on this prosperous and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They’re going to win a 2-inch win in Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later 4-3 wins in Poulter and Rary McIlroy, after the first two holes were destroyed.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from four points back-to-back levels at the start of dual games, even though on Furyk’s side the tie is enough to maintain victory.
However, after two days, the best may be that the Sunday counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea – not in any way – take off weapons without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has made significant positive measures over the past year, such as completed nuclear and missile tests, dismantled nuclear tests and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technologies.
“But we haven’t seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
“We cannot be sure of maintaining national security in the United States, so under such circumstances, the fact that we take ourselves out of arms unilaterally is not possible.
Although Ri repeated a well-known complaint that Washington does not accept the gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate issue, his opinion is important, however, in the sense that unilateral disarmament is not completely excluded, as Pjongang has previously done.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. sitting president and North Korea’s leadership summit in Singapore on 12 June in the statement, Kim convinced the Korean Peninsula to take off nuclear weapons and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to officially decide the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to facilitating the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States is calling for the “dynastics to be removed first,” said Ri.
“It’s a matter of saying that the sanctions would bring us to our knees is an immediate wish.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans to organise the next Kim-Trump summit, but what Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
On the other hand, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the party requiring the arms were South Korea and the United States, the situation would not have advanced to such a deadlock.
However, Ri's tone was significantly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continents was inevitable after the \"bad President- Trump called Kim to be a suicide-affiliated pilot.\"
Last year, Trump threatened to completely destroy North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach the ceasefire of weapons, but he stressed that there was still a lot of work left and the sanctions must remain until North Korea gave up on nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he did not have a timer: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia submitted that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the progress made.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “The strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and without failure until we witness the complete, final and confirmed nuclear weapons abandonment.
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions for North Korea since 2006, with the aim of stifling the financial channels for the production of Pjongang ballistics and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Rin UN General Assembly and announced that he would also visit Pjongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit was not successful.
When he left Pjongjang, he described the progress he had made, but North Korea condemned Pompeon-gangsteric requirements – only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States will take the appropriate measures.
According to Pompeo, Kim means, with the corresponding measures, security guarantees that Trump committed to meeting Singapore, and the transition towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest guide course
At Harvard University, all undergraduate students attend a course this year, which aims to increase students' rest. The course is a contrast to the university’s flourishing macho culture, where students weigh long nights with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students from the best university in the world are often unaware of their own well-being issues.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got an idea for the course of learning when teaching about the impact of sleep shortages.
“After my lecture, a young woman came to me, who said, “Why do I only hear about it now, in my last year of study?”
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I thought was surprising,” he told Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right dreams support academic and athletic performances and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Medicine at Harvard University and Vice President of the University’s Health Services, said the University ended up organising a course after they had heard how students were suffering from serious sleep problems during the week of study.
The hourly course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will be presented with a picture of the apartment room in which the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus obtain information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as on the impact of sleep shortages on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants will be told how long-lasting sleep loss can increase the risks of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate effect on students’ behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these things in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking, Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night long-lasting study marathons are still a subject of pride, and current technology and students’ ever-growing pressures made a dream-rich problem.
“To gain a sufficient and high quality sleep should be the “silent weapon” of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even the increase in weight, because sleep loss causes a state of hunger in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry,” the professor points out.
Raymond So, a student of 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he had attended one of his courses during his first year in Harvard.
He tells the course that he opened his eyes and gave a boost to all the students of the campus to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduate students would be able to complete a similar set of studies before the transition to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting the alarm clock for students to remind students of the bedtime in addition to morning awakening, and calls on them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on daytime rhythms, which can make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan shot out of Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers again experienced a new losing day when Dolly Menga shot through a scattered defense brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
Ibrox's players were in search of their first win since February 4th, which was held against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard now experienced his second defeat during his 18th game manager's career. Rangers stayed at eight points from the current leader of the dial.
Menga launched the ball for seven minutes before half, and the Rangers failed to fight the levelled situation after that.
Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to a third place, and the goal difference is higher only in Hibernia.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game in the face of an object thrown from the guest screen, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges in the assembly, where the team had hit Ayr and moved to the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 composition, where the team took a score from Hearts last week. The same strategy produced a result again when a well-structured assembly managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal for two minutes, when the first pass of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to paint Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free release to Craig Halkett, but the other defender Alan Lithgow managed only to kick his back.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but there was no confidence in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, in fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the requests of the Colombians.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. Former Ibrox's goalkeeper Liam Kelly, however, rejected the unbeatable shot by Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston’s goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just a team’s hard work.
Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long-term feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, which could have cooled the ball to Mengal for easy paint.
At the time, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created an appropriate hole for Moralos. However, the attack broke down Kelly's impressive rapid defense.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again when Lithgow and Hallet continued long feeds for each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise their lead at the last moments of the game, but McGregor's great defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow was able to get to his stations.
The Glenn Middleton, who changed the Rangers, also demanded a penalty kick after bringing Jacobs together, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
The next page is our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a equipment known as the Geigermeter.
The method became one of the science support pillars, and also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the film Coronado watches, which appeared in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are presenting scientists with a view from the herds:
\"What a miracle that is...
Rogers: “It’s a geigerometer, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can really hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.
Evans: “Look, now you’re really riding.
He died a few days before his 63th birthday in 1945.
The invention that carries his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory.
After processing, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins of several cancers
Dog dogs have been shown to be promising in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory in such a way that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2-proteins of several cancers. The modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda of the United States describes the method: “We believe this is a very promising vaccine.
HER2 controls the growth of several types of cancer, Professor Berzofsky explains. “These include breast cancer and the cancer of the ovaries, lungs and colons.
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got hit by critics after he praised Trump's Saturday Night Live campaign hats in his head.
The performance did not go according to plans
Kanye West became the leader of Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a gloomy style and reporting to the president of the 2020 election.
After presenting the third edition of the evening, “Gost Town – Trump’s Make America Great Again,” West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump, because he’s racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed from America a long time ago,” he said.
Last night's broadcast began with a skets, where Matt Damon disbanded the consultation of Brittany Kavanaugh in the Senate's Judicial Committee. The hearing is related to the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual harassment committed by Kavanaugh.
The West Pope was not presented in direct transmission, but the comic, Chris Rock, downloaded it into social media.
It is unclear whether Rock's purpose is to mock West with his mail.
In addition, the West complained to the public that he had been treated in a bowl because of the hat he held from his head.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I'm being bullied!
Then they say I'm in the margin, West says in Washington Examiner's interview.
West continues: “Do you want to see what the margin means, and says that you dress up for the Steel Man reference, because “you can’t order what I’m doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.
According to Varietty, West’s comments were blackmailing the public at least twice, and the performances of the show looked embarrassed. One of the present described the situation to the newspaper as follows: “The school studio went completely quiet.
West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
In many viewers, the West was confused by showing the song “I Love it – Perrier.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the leader of the Conservative TPUSA, who praised this courage on Twitter:
But Karen Hunter, the director of the agenda, said that West would only be his own, which is once wonderful.
“I can, however, decide to be a person (i.e. by taking this music or a sign of clothing or by supporting this art, which I consider to support and spread to my community harmful ideology.
He's a free person.
The same applies to us, he added.
The rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter before the evening, known as Kanye Westna.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows this Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember Prince of the late music legend, who changed its name to a symbol and later became an artist known as Prince.
Belfast Restaurant Boxer is charged with murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of murder after a man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in Belfast.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore region.
The accused is expected to be before the Belgian court on Monday.
The case shall be reviewed by the General Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the college game, is attacking toxic masculineism.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-reflecting hero role as Jon Snow in the HBO's violent fantasy series.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of the machosankar: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hard.
In an interview with the Cultural Union of Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “some have gone wrong,” and questiones the available means of addressing toxic masculines during the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, married to Rose Leslie, who is part of the Star Card of the Supreme Court, also 31-year-old, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene in the subject.
“The question of where we have gone wrong with masculineism is that I am now in a strong sense,” he says.
“What has been taught men about their growth in years that have led to problems that are now noticeable,” he said.
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is innate and what has been learned?
What is learned on TV and streets that make young boys feel like they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of pre- or downstream parts of the Supreme Court game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, received the need for battle fields and horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play, True West, which tells us about the film producer and his robbery brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose's wife was the best thing that the Master's Game has offered him.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie pretended to be Ygritte, Jon Snow's love destination in the fantasy series, which was won by Jon Snow.
The couple was married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's facilities in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported an increase of 14% of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820 000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan county conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination between LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up married to women due to conservative values in the country.
Many diseases result from insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the action to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data of the employee’s Republican Inventor and accuses the public of the distribution of dangerous lies and secrets.
Mr. Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied claims on Saturday that his employees had published personal information on three Republican sensors on the Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles confirmed that “distributors of claims are “immigrant right” comments and websites.
“Silver lies, lies, and more abusive lies,” Waters said in a statement published on Twitter.
Among the published data, Lindsey Graham, who represents South Carolina, and the home addresses and telephone numbers of Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing Senator Lindsey Graham, Utah.
An unknown person published information about Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee. The hearing concerned the Supreme Court’s candidate for membership of Mr. Bret Kavanaugh on charges of sexual abuse.
The year happened a little after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pounds and RedState report that according to the Hill Sanoma magazine, the messages were published from the IP address attached to Waters office and by a person belonging to Waters staff.
“This unwarranted accusation is totally wrong, and it is an absolute lie,” Water continued.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and safety have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false accusations, is not responsible for leaking these data.
This unwarranted accusation is totally wrong and absolutely a lie.
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“The way he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
“It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There is no reason to be threatened.
There is no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
The state should behave moderately and calmly.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism with Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes from Waters in the intercontinental elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
“It’s incredible if this is true,” he said.
Waters announced in his opinion that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent accusations.
\"We believe that the factors will be revealed, he continued, \"and that they will be legally held accountable for all the destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff's members.
Johnny English strikes again – a low-performance Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already the established tradition to search for Brexit references from any film that is expensive to Britain. However, this does not appear to be suitable for Johnny English’s agent industry and action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurgenced to life in the next part of 2011, “Johnny English – Newborn”
Can the nation's satire of the cheek become a new national export journey in Britain?
So, in this way, the dumb-eyed, glamorous and inconvenient Johnny English has already earned his permission to repeat it. His name is above all about the fact that it is a collection of creations aimed at the non-English-speaking film market.
Of course, it's about the crazy secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe a melting glamour around, but appears to be a mix of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and it's an unlucky one of the notebook musicians at the London opening concert in 2012.
The character is based on a brand-new cosmopolitan and a mysterious world man who was originally presented by Atkins in the TV commercials of Barclaycard.
The last show has a moment.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on helicopters dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's stage bumps into his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems sublime and strangely unnecessary, especially because “sacrifice” film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
The humor seems to be directed to children, and the confusion of Johnny English does not seem to me to be as ingenious and sharp-looking as the comedy of Mr. Bean's muse roles.
The recurring starting point is that Britain is in trouble the worst.
Cyber hacker is infiltrated in the UK’s high-level spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents operating in the field as a sturdy of an agent employed – presented as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunate small role.
This is the last drop for the important and superficial Prime Minister, who is already ready for his ears in the midst of political indiscretion: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t just offer him enough space.
When the intelligence service advisors inform him that all the spies on the field have been revealed, a person who has already moved away from the active service must be invited.
Of course, it’s a turovay in Johnny English’s own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher of a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in spying in the feet of skill. The subject boasts some clever jokes; English keeps the School of Rock-type lessons in the intelligence halls.
English will be praised for the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again with his endlessly patient fighting couple Bough, who will continue to play Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a diver whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to get into his rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to confront Olga Kurylenko's premiere super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletovan.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is becoming a manipulator of the charismatic IT billionaire. Jason Volta, an actor of Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the UK’s computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough is transformed into a farce: the pair disguised as serveers will light up the fire of a fine French restaurant and cause chaos in the pursuit of a secret Volta luxury yacht. The company will get into the house of Volta with virtual glasses to end up in a purely anarchist world.
Even the final aesthetics of the creators are cursing at the end of the scene, but despite all the inviolability and charm, the film still seems a little bit like a child audience.
The film can be regarded as moderate.
When I watch Johnny's English movies, I've had the same thought: Why is the British film industry not able to give Rowan Atkins a role that would justify his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s leader, Labour, is considering a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told that the company leaders are demanding the transfer of savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution in the form of an extra free day for workers.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three days of the weekend with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘school’ the party’s financial programme and its plans to re-calculate the policy for workers.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the High-Level Labour Party will tell Sunday Times: “Reviewing the List has been announced before the year’s exchange.
The change will not take place in the moment, but the four-day working week will be the objective of a party's approach to balancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first body to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the four-day work week shift in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective shall not be to provide undivided support in the lines of Labour.
The president of the Labour Party states: “The working week of the Labour Party is not a party’s line, and the party does not consider such a shift.
Mr. John McDonald, Minister of Finance of the Government of the shadow government, took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of the “reinforced dictators” and of those of general interest.
According to the Finance Minister of the Government of the shadow government, current shareholders of water companies would not be allowed to participate in the full, because the government led by Labour could implement reductions, on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to set employees in the management of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the private sector’s share capital to the management of the employees. The plan is to pay an individual employee up to £500 per year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing the 60-minute program on whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation on the prosecutions against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican engineers to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60-minute program on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out where they could change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleagues.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told you I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the accusations came out, and asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.
The voice of Graham, instead, looks like a stone.
“I’ve made my decision about Bret Kavanaugh and it’s a bomb threat,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following thing: Bret strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one named him was able to confirm the matter.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York is a musical event that is as impressive as its mission: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, the 7th-time Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to listen to the New York Central Park lawns, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also make known the real goal of the event: eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eliminate poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket event (if you are not willing to pay a VIP ticket), the public shall carry out different tasks or works, such as volunteering, to send an email to a political decision-maker or to call a call, or to perform any other work that disseminates awareness of the project’s objectives.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that there is no longer 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one of the ‘cliktivism’ among others – the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that he has recorded more than 19 million works on behalf of the different goals – since 2011.
According to this, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds achieved so far have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the UK, committed to helping children develop their full potential – the Group committed to delivering Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4 700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and just like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers of history,” said Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador to Power of Nutrition, at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also invited to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions. The Board has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the website of the movement is: “Why do you think we can make the end of extreme poverty?
Global citizen’s answer: “You’re going to be long and hard, and there’s a lot of compression stones ahead of us.
We will succeed, however, as great civil rights struggles and anti-parheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running a New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists like Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janele Monae.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the Navy as an obstacle.
According to US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Washington’s Washington Examiner magazine, Washington may, if needed, provide assistance to its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russian operations in Syria – the invitation of the legal government – are an excuse for identifying new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that the reason for the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the authority, there are ways and means to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep the ferry routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, through the island to ensure that the energy they provide does not reach the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumer Association. It is a non-profit group that is profiled as a voice tower for energy consumers in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
“Iran and Russia’s economic option is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel in another, he says, and describes Russia as the circus number of a single pace, whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The presentations will take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to improve the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
In order to enhance this, the Trump regime, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the \"unnecessary \"Nord Stream 2\" pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow’s retreat.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of 110 billion cubic meters of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that behind Washington’s opposition there are purely economic reasons and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has led to a counter reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial roofing organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay separate from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that the third state is involved in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Union, recently said after the meeting of German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, intends to carefully consider – the position of the presidential election in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that he would be careful to be a presidential candidate after the mid-terms.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the nomination at an open conference in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and repair our innocent regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” he said according to The Hill magazine.
“After the sixth day of November, I intend to carefully consider the position of the presidential candidate.
Warren estimates that during the opportunity of President Donald Trump, he says, \"he is taking the country in the wrong direction.\"
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump does for our democracy,” he said.
Warren has appeared in direct criticism of Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court, Brittany Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren wrote, “We must have an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, according to the poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s electors are not in favour of this position in 2020.
According to a study conducted by the Suffolk University’s Political Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of the expected voters in Massachusetts do not support the position of the senator.
32% were in favour of a candidate.
Many of the respondents were in favour of former governor Deval Patrick's position on the condition of 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other debates have raised a number of nominal democratic candidates for the 2020 elections, for example, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to his son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year recruiting forces in Iraq in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and was charged with family violence.
“What my own son has to go through after returning home, I can very much identify with other families who face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers are returning home,” he told the public meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoh, Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest in the living room, and said to his son, like other war veterans, as a little changed home, they are returning in trouble, they return to wonder whether he and his companions in the army and the Air Force have done this for the benefit of the country.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Dr. Dan Bennett, he was charged with family violence and assault on women, as well as with domestic violence and gun handling.
The 18 states and the Columbia Federation support a new action against asylum.
The eighteen states and the Columbia Federation are seeking a change to the new line of entry into force in the United States, which states that asylum is not granted to people fleeing from gang violence or family violence.
18 State and federal representatives have left the letter of justice on Friday in Washington, and the letter supports asylum seekers who violate the line, NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union raised in August against the federal line.
He tells his partner, and his violent gang members, who abused him, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large proportion of which are U.S. asylum seekers, countries where gang violence and family violence are a common problem for all levels of society.
The U.S.'s new asylum policy reversed the decision taken by the appeal committee in 2014 that paperless migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of family violence.
The General Prosecutor of the Columbia Federal District, Karl Racine, commented in his statement on Friday that a new line would ignore the decades of state, federal and international law.
\"The law of the Member State requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle to violating this principle is stated in the letter \"Friends of Justice\".
The prosecutors also claim in a letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from accessing the United States is detrimental to the economy because the firemen are likely to become entrepreneurs and bring the necessary additional labour force.
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration to suspend the granting of asylum from victims fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence.
“The place of residence is intended for persons who flee from their homeland because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular class of society, or because of persecution or fear caused by political opinion,” the Sessions announced in his statement of 11 June on the new asylum policy.
It was never intended to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survival in Palu – the number of dead victims found has already doubled.
For survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
“Tilanne is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kuuma, calming her hot baby, at an evacuation center in a desolated city.
“Ambulances bring new bodies for a minute.
The clean water is in the least.
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, pick their watered goods and try to save what is still to be washed.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospitals that have been damaged in the wake of the 7.5 magnitude are full.
Some injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest please outside the military hospital, where patients are treated due to persistent, powerful extremities.
His eyes are filled with tears when he saw how the fierce earthquake nourished the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save you.
I was stuck between the walls of the wall, and I thought Harris told Associated Press, and tells me that he was married to his family in the city.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of provocation - propaganda notices -
The U.S. Ambassador of China accuses Beijing of using the American magazine as a propaganda tool. This happens a week after the Chinese newspaper had published four-page advertisements in the U.S. newspaper, which praised the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese Daily magazine in the Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after being accused of being involved in the 6/11 Congress elections in China.
Trump's accusations about Beijing's attempts to intervene in the US elections mean, according to the U.S. authorities speaking to Reuters, a new step in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-emergency trade war, where both parties impose customs duties on the exporting products of the other party.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term governor of the state of Iowa, says Beijing suffered damage to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a great exporter of agricultural products in China.
China is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda notifications in our own free press,” said Branstad in his statement of opinion published at Des Moines Register on Sunday.
“By downloading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the traditions of the United States’ prestigious free word and press by placing a paid notice on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“In the journals of the streets of Peking, however, differing opinions appear only limited, and real, distinctive opinions that Chinese citizens can have on the alarming development of their economies. This is due to the fact that the media is strictly at the backdrop of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
Branstad continues by telling us that “one of the biggest newspapers in China said to publish the offer,” the article he wrote, but does not specify what the newspaper is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasko dispels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many Republicans’ peaks stand behind and defend the Supreme Court’s judge candidate, Brittany Kavanaugh, may, according to analysts, lead to a counter-reaction, especially in the future elections with female voters.
The emotions surrounding the event have been on a big tour, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed in the vote.
“These things cannot be cancelled,” says Professor Grant Reeher Syracuse of the University of Maxwell in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) in the last minute offer of the FBI investigation to stop angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and National Reform Group MoveOn’s reporter on Friday according to the newspaper published in the capital.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang, “The November is coming, in the light of the opinion of the Senate’s ruling Republicans, when deciding to move forward in Kavanaugh’s appointment, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democracy and motivation will no longer be measurable,” says Stu Rothenberg, an unbinding political analyst in interviewing the news site.
“People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially for the female voters and younger voters, aged 18-29 who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans are moving forward with confirmation even before the Ford talks against the candidate for the Supreme Court, where this claimed sexual harassment.
“This is going to be a confusion for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee for the NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“This is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is to be questioned. It is about how Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Fordia-, Guy Cecil, the head of the United States Group for Democrat-friendly Priorities.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony as the majority tended to the latter.
According to a new opinion by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford’s testimony is absolute or likely, while 35% says that they will definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or absolutely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake goes on, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one of the other charges of Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian's report.
Ford, in front of the Committee on Legal Affairs, he was acquitted by Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest candidate for membership revealed him to his family at the student festival while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet counter to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Open Source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In the interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, Inrupt’s goal is to control the world.
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his startup.
“It’s a historic moment.
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own-personal data warehouse – that is, POD.
It may include contact information lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available at a single browser at the same time.
In a personal data warehouse, it is unique to have a full user who has access to any type of data.
The company calls it a personal entry into force through information.
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to give resources, processes, and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes the security platform that Berners-Leen, Brucen, IBM purchased, some of the developers employed with the project, as well as a community consisting of volunteers.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with tools available on Inrupt’s website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to offer people a complete change in which all of their business models are translated into their heads together at night.
“We do not ask their consent to the matter,” he said.
Berners-Lee, published in the media on Saturday, wrote the Inrupt task of providing a commercial energy and ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the network built for the new Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee soiled the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after Inrupt.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.

The friends of the free match waited all night for Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Possua
Imagine a situation where you've been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament and not present the whole event.
In the San Jose event program there were 13 matches, of which six main series matches were played, and the show was to be presented as a direct broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK.
In the morning, just when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the round, the program changed to the great sturdy of the pipsa Possuu viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch for the whole night's match.
One friend of the free match opened up on Twitter describing the replacement of the match with a child’s drawing “one sick joke”
According to the law, this content was not suitable to be presented at 6 a.m. in the morning, so they had to change it in the children's programme, explained Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication director of Bellatori's program.
“Pipsy Possu, yes –
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that the schedules will be working so that British viewers can follow the events in the future.
“I’m thinking about a re-transmission to make the program work,” Coker said.
“The clock is six in the morning, and we will not get the program presented before Sunday, which in turn is Monday at their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, the messages began to go in the direction and the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a terrible situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of her sexuality
Tom Daley, a swimmer and an Olympic athlete, says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that she only noticed when she comes to high school that “all things are not the same as me.
Lauren Lavern, speaking in the Radio 4-channel Desert Island Discs program, said Daley about the gay rights he spoke about to give others a ‘stoy’.
He also tells us how, after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a regular runner of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As a guest in Laverne’s first program, Daley said he knew himself as a young “slower” than everyone else, because “it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and jobs –
He says: “To this day these emotions, feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me strength and energy that I have needed to succeed.
He says that he wanted to show himself to be ‘very’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality finally appeared.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he appears in this year’s National Championships to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without sanctions, and wanted to give “sacrifice” to other people.
The three-time world champion tells a man of his love – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 as a surprise.
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things when you are so young, he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later,” said Daley.
The couple received the boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which the Dalen-size perspective has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have been around winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympics.
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 only at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Dale about the 2012 Olympic tickets.
“I couldn’t tell him that he was no longer there to be in the front row,” said Daley.
“I kept him from my hand when his breath stopped. Only after the breath had really stopped and he was dead, I finally realized that he was not vulnerable,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was something I had dreamt of all my life – jump in front of the public at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” said Daley.
This was also an inspiration for his first piece of music – The Heather S Model’s song, “Proud,” who raised feelings when he was preparing for the Olympics, and who still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Disc is sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-art Mickelson shift bench for Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson violates the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he has to be very disappointed in avoiding the record tour as an unhappiness show in history.
Mickelson, who plays for a two-year-old event on a record 12th time, moved to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk, for the time of the football and outdoors to be played on Saturday.
In general, the American five-fold Major tournament winner at the center of attention now spent half the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to get his shot.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most accurate drivers on his career, is not an ideal choice for a strict Le Golf National field, where a long-growing career is punishable by inaccurate strikes.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, the 9th Sunday game against Francesco Molinari, a well-known British Open winner, who is playing together with the arrivaler Tommy Fleetwood, the goal of which is to explore all four winning tubes this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind 12 double games get a flying exit, Michelson's game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could he say?
“She fully understands the role she played today, and she killed me in the back, a bit, and said she was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went, and this is the solution we made.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson violates Nick Faldon's record of most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup, which, however, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but according to Furyk, his presence brings something undefined to the team.
“She’s funny, sarcastic, clever, she likes to joke at the expense of people, and she’s a funny guy who everyone likes to follow,” she explains.
“The younger players were also having fun with him this week. It’s funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stakes in the game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European Team knows how long leadership can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from the experience that Ryder Cup’s measurable leadership can be a hard trip before the last day’s two games.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where he led the Seve Ballesteros to a five-point leadership over the Americans, but he survived as a winner on the cliff lines just and just on the size of his nose and won at the narrowest possible margin141-2-31-2.
“It reminds us of how we were running in Valderrama, we were running in Brookline, where we lost, but we won Valderrama, albeit scarcely,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team’s 5-3 wins on Friday and yesterday on the 10-16-year-old Le Golf National field.
The history will show both me and all other team members that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot in a big car.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only for it.
As I’ve always said, I’m focused on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s opposite: the best players in the world.
I’m glad that his team’s players have completed a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I’m never going to lick until it falls into such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, priority is given to individual performances, and then we talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity is tested at the bottom.
This is a message that must be transmitted to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to whom alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, the other half captain Jim Furyk will require a better performance for his players as individuals than they could as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's full translations in both directions. He was involved in a team won in Brookline before he became a loser when the European team won the \"Medinah with a miracle\".
“I remember every evil word,” he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team, stretched the ranks of his team into the last day’s experiments.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it comes to moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we are going to do wonders tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of attempting to lead a military battle and he will face the most important game of Roy McIlroy. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next to meet their European opponents.
“I put the group’s friends in this order, because I think it’s going through the whole tournament,” Bjorn commented.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The newest fregate of the German Navy should have been introduced in 2014, with the aim of replacing the ageing cold-war equipment, but it will be introduced early next year due to faulty systems and explosion-growing costs, the local media will tell us.
According to a military reporter who spoke to Die Zeit, the launch of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg fleet has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-transmission problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they are equipped with efficient cannons, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, as well as with humidification of radar, as well as infra-red and acoustic signals with a cutting-edge technique.
The main features of the ship also include its longer maintenance distance – the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the leading warships of technology, which are said to be to improve German influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete at the time when they enter the service, Die Zeit magazine notes.
The poor-born F125-fregant ended up in headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the platform into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss farm in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after it is delivered.
A little is known for the reasons of the return, but the German media has been talking about essential software and hardware issues, which make the warship an inappropriate battle mission.
Software shortages are particularly important because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg category is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the possibilities of the fleet to later updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, which has 7 000 tons of capacity, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the whole project’s price sheet is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to be up to EUR 3.1 billion, with the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the introduction of new fregates have arisen when the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet could be used for the least possible vessels.
According to the Authority, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ones have been sent to replace them.
He complained that no frigate of Baden-Württemberg could have been introduced to the Navy.
The Environmental Organization is eavesdropping the secret life of bats
A new study in the upper part of Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the terrain in hunting food.
New research is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future protection measures.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland monitors the scarce and dwarf packages, as well as earrobes and water wings in the Inverewe Garden of the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage equipment shall be placed at the main points of the area to monitor the operation of jaws during the period.
The organization’s employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the recordings and the nature of which they are involved will be ensured by the analysis of the experts.
Based on the results, a plan and report on the environment will be created where the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture of the area’s scale.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s natural conservation advisor, hopes to reveal the results of which habitats are the most important to the bats, and how different species use them.
The information is helpful in the planning of the habitats, such as the creation of wetlands and the management of forest areas, so that the rest and the species involved are taken into account.
Scotland and the United Kingdom’s jaw populations have decreased significantly over the last hundred years.
Building and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of jaws.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, including fly paper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of the top hunting methods, their ears are more useful in fishing the catch than in the eyes.
The bats use advanced mining technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation that focuses on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take rest seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, check rest sites and, in some cases, rescue activities in animals.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only sole protection zone for the countries of the Threeven mansion in Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the 10 jaw species of Scotland are met in the area.
According to the landlord David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
“Threave is very good for the bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings and trees, and we all have a good living environment.
There is not yet much to be known about the holidays, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what the bats need to succeed.
He emphasizes how important it is to check the buildings in case of bats before starting rehabilitation, because the destruction of one resting place of bats can inevitably cause up to 400 female leopards and sonic deaths and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing them, disrupting them or destroying their resting places are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Finnish Association for the Protection of Leaks, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don’t know how their populations work.
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled his rape accusations as “valids” and says people want to “mainize themselves” by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have implemented claims to challenge the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of rape of a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a lasvegasil hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared at the Instagram direct broadcast to 142 million followers only hours after the claims were made. The 33-year-old footballer, 33-year-old, defeated the accusations sharply and described them as “voicing.”
“No, no, no, no.
What they've said today, false news, five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine, the player continued to smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel’s interview with the court on claims that they have called the Reuters News Office “unusual reporting of doubts covered by privacy protection.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for life-long suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged case is said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are told that they have met in the night club and moved to the player's room where he is alleged to have raped this anally, according to the documents submitted by the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event, and said that he had a 99 percent good type, but which, at the same time, produced disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of sexes, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police station and took photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in the settlement, because he was “hard of the possibility of revenge,” and worried, “has become the subject of public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old now says that he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure, because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow of Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team to Juventus with a $100 million contract.
Brexit: United Kingdom-wide to regret forever - the end of car manufacturing
“The UK would disappear forever if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit,” said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that he had to be “notable” – the notification of the United Kingdom unit of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Burnaston Derby if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
“We need a deal,” Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays on visible job losses if Brexit is terminated without an agreement.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, made nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of them were taken to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be interrupted,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston’s unit.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed the fears of the European Union’s liberation in how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW has announced that he will close his factory for a month in the event of Brexit.
The main concern is that according to the report by car manufacturers, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota production line is run on the right-time JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and disruptions in the sector.
Keeping more than a day’s stock at Derbyshire’s factory is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be interrupted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is \"calibration\" to avoid these checks at the border.
“We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we need to take advantage of,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
“Not only in Toyota, but also in other manufacturers’ statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains to date.
Toyota can’t tell you how long production should be stopped, but warns that additional costs should reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and serves as a professional association supplier at the factory, says concern among the growing members: “The jobs lost according to my experience will never return.
“We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be moved to another week, due to the obligation of the Supreme Judge-in-Office of the Court of Justice of the Republic, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russian interference with elections, Trump's assistants' contacts with Russia and the president's potential activities to prevent justice.
In Washington, for months, Trump's intention is to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would endanger the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to its Rosestenstein Centres about the possibility of recording secret discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of disabling the President on the basis of Appendix 25 to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was said to have been Rosenstein's dismissal.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York City, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he, rather than prefer, would separate Rosestenstein, but the meetings were postponed because it was time for a hearing with the Senate's Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long study against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the Senate's vote.
Trump’s press director Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting of Rosenstein, Sanders said: “The number of days has not been set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for a week, because of everything else, because of what is happening at the highest court.
But I always want to keep the press up to date.
Some journalists might disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference after 10 September.
The newsman, Chris Wallace, asked for a reason for this.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is for reasons other than the inconsistency of TV reporters’ request for attention, but he said: “It does not deny the fact that they are looking for attention.”
Sanders, however, understood the future increase in direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more polling hours than any president before him,” he said, and adds more evidence of the strategy book: “We have reviewed those numbers.
“The press events will continue to be organized,” Sanders said, “but it’s far better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to act often in this way and you have seen us act this way several times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States.
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with the participants.
The presentation alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president has probably shown the reason for this when it comes to unhappiness and timeless journalists.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland’s health care system to express their gratitude and wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Mr Jeane Freeman of Scotland sent a letter while the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU is less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already been prepared to cover the costs that will be incurred by EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, differences between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for possible non-contractual differences.
I know that these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much we value every employee's contribution to citizenship.
The colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to the main injury
Tenssee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in an emergency operation since the team was destroyed by 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports the reporter Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that they had been injured just before half the time.
“He came to the sideline and simply fell down to it,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on pairs and taking him to the side for a more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State's supplier told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has received surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that there was no information on the type/diversity of the infringement at this stage, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time in the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corby’s success in attracting young voters.
The increase of bread tax applies to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year – to help the homeless
Theresa May is coming to inform foreign buyers today of the higher rates of stamping when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as a company to neutralize Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper apartments and paid attention to the taxation of good incomes.
The increase of bread tax is directed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, and this extra money will be directed to government actions to facilitate the suffering of homeless people.
The additional fee, which will be added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the 2nd allowance and investment housing increases, can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to $120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, which will increase prices and make it difficult for primary home buyers to have ownership housing in the market.
Many wealthy regions in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘a ghost shops’ because many foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only take weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduced stamp tax as a way of facilitating the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of properties high by buying the country and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for affordable housing in order to remedy the shameful situation of British housing.
Corbyn has published a series of important proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on the leaks and the cessation of productive voting.
He would also like to give the delegations more power in the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to devote my Prime Minister’s dream to the return of the British – that every generation of life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy apartments as easily as people living in the UK.
Too many people have become too distant a dream of having a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: “My first goal is to lead the Scottish National Team.
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his “his ultimate goal,” is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited about the challenge of raising the country's home-to-home team back to their feet. The team is currently in third place in the UK's 2nd edition.
Ross moved the lights to the stadium – this summer after he had guided St Mirren back to Scotland’s election in the last year.
“As a singer, I wanted to play my country in the team.
I got into the second team and it was there, Ross tells me at the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched Scotland’s games with my father, and it’s something that has always drawn me back.
Such an opportunity will only be received if I succeed as a manager of the company.
Ross's predecessors are Sunderland's manager, including Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former director of Alloa Athletic says that there was no concern about entering his nameful predecessors' boots in nominal association. He has previously rejected Barnsley and Iptswich Town's offers.
“At this moment, I will measure my own success as to whether I can restore this company’s choice.
Based on the structure and the ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of its choice,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably think I’m only going to be successful if I get the team back on track.
Ross has only served as a manager for three years: first as the Deputy Director of Dumbarton, and then for 15 months in the Heat Coach Group.
He then helped Alloa rise from the three-series fall games and raised St Mirren’s drop-off pattern during the next season.
Ross says he's feeling better now than ever in the teams of Cley, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was probably in the real road trip with my career, he remembers the time when he moved to the leadership of Alloa.
“I truly believed I was better suited to manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I made a lot of money, and I got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be hard.
The player has to find out a wide range of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but the team's leadership seems to be the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for my job, and I feel better in my body than ever in my adult life.

The summer thermal wave has been fired for pubs fighting with British difficulties, but at the same time it has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the sales of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin’s business consulting company from CGA said: “The continued sunny weather and the more predictable participation of England in the world’s football championship meant that in July, the sale of pubs like June was 2.8% higher, while in restaurants the month was even worse.
The decline of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking party were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decrease in the sales of restaurants.
The pubs focused on the food also suffer from the helith, but less dramatically than those who run restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted out drinking in their mind.
The sale of pubs and bar drinks by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food had a 3% decrease in sales.
Paul Newman’s free-time and hotel restaurant consulting company RSM says: “The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the outside catering market.
It is no surprise that the fight in the restaurant chains continues, although the decline in sales of 4.8% per year is striking, especially now that the start is currently fighting with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have become worse for the food-focused operators, and only time does it show whether the film’s lower temperature in the industry is painfully needed for the breathtaking state.
The overall increase in sales of pubies and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowing down in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer to sell the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which collects and analyses the results in 47 areas of competence from a group with a combined turnover of over £9 billion. It is considered a reliable measure in the sector.

The news raised the concern that the bricks could share sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they were holding a ‘head account’, which is shown to parents.
The fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of the ‘Instagram feikki accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for the sharing of images.
The news has raised fears that the accounts can be published in sexual content.
20 per cent of students said they were going to keep a clean ‘head account’ for parents while using other private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager, in which she hoped she would be raped after her 13-year-old daughter was in a secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rhotorian Advisory Board (HMC), 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 kept two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted to hold secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilith Doyle – The Voice of Sportsmen – Scottish Sports Board
Eidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Sports Board as a non-executive member of the Governing Board. He will participate in the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most award-winning general athlete in Scotland. The Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the title as a great opportunity for athletes to benefit from the extensive experience of the athlete in the last decade.
“Eilidhi is highly respected with athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I’m sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as the sound tower of athletes, and I hope that I can be of benefit and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction.
Four Olympicic athletes who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips to Atlanta in 1996, operating as a permanent commentator in the BBC, lost their walking ability as a result of a passing brain circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's just time to show, to recover, and what to do.
This has been a hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I’m already training in agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
Mothers cow-companied advertising share opinions online
The advertising of the breast pumping company, nursing mothers of lypsylehm, has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has put a product on the market, called “the world’s first silent and wearing breast pump,” the marketing of it is accelerated by a advertising that uses the style of music videos, which describes the freedom of the new pump for nursing mothers.
Four true-life mothers danced in the barn, for example, the following song said: “Yes, I’m short, but I don’t see him, and if you don’t notice them, they’re not journeys, but it’s boobs.
Kertsähe continues: “Better it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, lypsy my findings
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company caused a discussion online.
The video collected 77,000 views and hundreds of comments has sparked a conflicting reaction to viewers. Many people say it’s going to ruin the daily ‘bads’ of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows in advertising this product was a very poor decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them shortly after delivery, one commentator writes.
Elvie-brown pump is an unnoticed fit in the breast-feeding lens (Elvie/Mother)
The other viewer commented: “It is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why can’t they be used to advertise the breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?
The third comment added: \"A total reality-freedd advertising -
I also received the defenders: a woman admitted that the advertisement was in her opinion,
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product, reads in one comment.
Another viewer commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (some in the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘know themselves as cows’.
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the advertisement, women in the video reveal that they have danced the unnoticed pumps into their breasts on the ground.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pump feel like cows.
The elvie pump, instead, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it is perfectly suitable for breast-feeding in, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balar, a partner and artistic director of the Mother advertising agency, commented: “The Elvie pump is a fashionable product that earned bold and provocative income on the market.
By clicking on the nursing mothers and lypsyphemies, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the light, we brought a new pump of incredible freedom in a entertaining and consistent way.
The elvie pump has ended up in headlines before.
In London, the mother of two children appeared in Catwalk, a designer, Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silences
The number of displaced migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged. This is due to the fact that, as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump regime, the placement of children in the local families has been hampered.
Most local families are traditionally made up of undocumented migrants, and registration as a local family can endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential local families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the authorities of entry.
Matthew Albence, a high-level admission and customs authority, recently admitted that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for their families for their families for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
“In the country, 80% of people who are either members of the local family or members of their households are illegal, and most of them are criminals foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people, Albence says.
In order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in a court within one month of the date of their detention rather than the 60-day time limit previously used, the staff of the reception centre shall state.
Many prefer to appear through a video conference rather than in person when driving to a court dealing with alien matters.
Those who are not considered entitled to help will be promptly expelled.
According to the reports published in the last months of the reception centre workers and the system, the time spent in child imprisonment affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or forced attempts.
According to lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child despair can remain unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that children are transferred to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish personnel to leave immediately
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as the prime minister, said the foreign troops were illegally in the country using the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and that “with the help of the people will act according to it.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war against terrorism is almost over – in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and where millions of people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight until Syria has been cleansed of both terrorist organizations and illegal foreign troops.
The United States has about 2,000 troops placed in Syria, where they are mainly trained and guided by Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad’s opposing Arab forces.
France has invested in fighting to tear over 1,000 troops into the country.
On the refugee question, Moualem said that the conditions were good for returning and accused some of spreading Western-irritional fears, encouraging refugees to stay out of the country.
“We have called on the international community and relief organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicising a thing that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid before the end of the war has been agreed by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the large-scale attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia, in which three million people live.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has clear time limits and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters, which will be destroyed.
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to soon invite the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create a post-war Syrian constitution for the election.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the revision of the existing Constitutional Law, and warned him not to interfere.
Why Trump Will Be Chosen for Another Age
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to wish for, launch and scandal to end his presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic decision of the Presidency ever.
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue in viewers.
After 2014, the best viewing time figures have doubled with CNN at 1,05 million and nearly tripled at 1,6 million MSNBC.
Fox News said Nielsen had an average of 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million people four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has received cable TV: top readings of 3.5 million viewers in the most important news.
“This is a garbage that attracts people, because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neal Baer, the chief producer of the ABC’s Designed Survivor program, who says of a minister who will be president of the attack’s destroyed Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell says.
The chaos has a sense of entertainment.
By way of derogation from other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade will be able to get the members of the immigrant families to each other and how the world economy can do.
Inevitability is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the duties of a aware citizen to look at a six-hour expert panel that claims to use Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strike-stripping pilot tactics (Washington Post said, \"a supremacy of a bunch of clothes, and the consequences of the unrivaled images of Storm Daniels President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
“What he does seems to be true-tv, because it is partly about giving the public something every night,” says the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the Pantilainamamo series Brent Montgomery Trump’s show on changing persons and daily changing plots (NFL-riat, Kim Jong-un’s praise).
You can't skip any episodes, or you're gonna fall off the wheel.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a beautiful sunny day at the North Coast of the Far East, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while laughing at CNN.
He could not get rid of the program in which Brittany Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Out of the world, money flows to a strict mid-term struggle
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the Congress elections, two candidates already have to fight from one place.
This newly-relined Pittsburg election is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, which became true of the second electoral district in the last spring special elections.
Lamb competes with the other elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is in overlap with the new 17th district.
The division of the region was re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral districts would favour Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th election has been launched in the financial departments of the main political parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after a wide-ranging 18th congressional election in Pennsylvania.
The place had been in the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20%.
Political commentators have taken a great advantage for Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from its intentions
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the low reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Panaman Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization Group.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call back American diplomat leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, based on the ‘no longer recognizing Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert’s statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high level of unemployment and mental crime.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed the high level of security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the year was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from trying to move to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was desired to progress and this effectively decided on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pencen is now expected to give a sign to a meeting scheduled in mid-October on what kind of emphasis the government will give to the meeting, diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned in all silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new old messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, and there were two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Law Officer Robert Mueller on the possibility of blocking President Trump's right, which now has very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reported a trendy investigation on whether Trump’s campaign was secret to Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will see that he is accountable for it just when preparing for it to go back to his constituents and possibly be judged as equals.
There are a lot of whisperings here, and I do not mean to say that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been prepared to eat from Hitler's power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
The course of history goes to such turning points where the unspoiled march of democracy is either accelerating or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been tightened since it became aware that he had proposed the recording of a secret President’s speech and considered the possibility of the President’s inability to deal with his task.
According to Rosenstein, The Times report is incorrect.
“How do we react if the newly required FBI investigation into the operation of Brittany Kavanugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we voting in the middle elections for a Congress that is responsible for President Trump?
If we fail to do so, our democracy will take a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success in Prague because of the lesson I have received.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled from Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomat bag.
He survived, moved to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on the table that was decorated with the hammer.
How could this tradition be more than optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans Optimistic to Meet Rapid Wien
Rangers will meet at their home on the Thursday of Rapid Viento, knowing that, in the previous month, after the match against Villarreal in Spain, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the European League of G.
The knee injury stopped the midfield player Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before Villarreal 2-2, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a poncho for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
We might have been able to catch a win at the end of the game, but overall, the game is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got to the other one and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group, we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard about my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the trainings are smooth.
Hopefully now we can push full, leave the past season behind us and succeed.
Fear associated with pension savings takes women’s night sleep
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only few had spoken about it to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the study in the country reported that they would discuss with their spouse the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents said they spoke about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional person and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in costs.
Take economic advice into the debate: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care funding options can include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for covering these costs, or self-refundable insurance, if you can afford it.
Download legal documents: to prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a charter for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to define a trusted person to take care of the financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to take care of them.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer the questions about her medications and allergies?
Write such information on the plan so you are prepared for the situation.
“It’s not just for the economy, who is his doctor,” Martin asks.
What medicines are used for?
Who cares about the dog?
Keep the plan ready.

Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in strong earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the city in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
As communication connections across the region, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the North of Dongala County, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 Magnitus.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palusta and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawes province, located in the narrow Gulf of Sulawes Island, on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and whose population was estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the middle of the 40th anniversary of the city.

The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated 299,200 population in 2017.
The main industries of the central Sulawes province, and in particular the Donghala Coastal Region, are fisheries and agriculture.
The price of nickel is also important, but it is focused on the opposite coast of Morowa.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalaan have hit several tsunamis over the last hundred years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers earthquakes.
I had some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Finland on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the Indian ocean coasts. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitud’s strike struck the most inhabited island of Indonesia, Jaava, south of the tsunami, killing almost 700 people on the southern coast of the island.
2009: 7.6 Magnitud’s earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 Magnitud’s earthquake struck one of the islands of Sumatran Mentawa, causing a ten-meter high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake struck Aceh’s Pidie Jaya region, causing destruction and panic in memory of the enormous destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people died when the buildings were broken.
2018: The powerful earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.

Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death penalty for the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipopov, a suspect in a terrorist attack requiring eight lives in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
According to the charges, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in a log-like attack on the West Side Highway wheelchair in Manhattan, where he was riding on pedestrians and bikers.
According to the report on the death penalty for the southern government of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed his eight victims and caused serious physical injuries.
According to the Court of Justice, both of these charges may be subject to the death penalty.
After weeks of the attack, federal law imposed 22-person charges on Saipov, including eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation. The federal prosecutors typically use this criminal name in cases of organised crime. In addition, the charges included a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required “a remarkable design and preparation,” the prosecutors pointed out and described the manner in which Saipov carried out his actions to be “serious, cruel and shameful.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alessandro Damia Pagnucci,” the statement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The previous time, when the right to death in the southern part of New York has passed a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murder by two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has last been implemented in New York in the Federal case of 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a conspiracy for spying against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric building on 19 June 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of regret in the days and months that followed.
He told the researchers his work felt good, the police said.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had received inspiration from his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He was responsible for the 22th-person accusation that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence lawyers representing Saipov, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and not recognition and life-cycle without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by those involved in these events,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked him not to demand a death penalty.
The Conservative Parliament said NIGEL FAAGE should be held responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Nigerian Farage said today in protest against conservatives, “to mobilize the civilian army.”
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives proposed him to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Commissioner for Conservatives Peter Bone said to the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would already be out if Farage was a Brexit secretary.
But May encounters a profoundly divided line of lightning, matching the challenge, which is underlined by the conservatives on the edge of the stay, who joined a separate Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep Chequers' compromise proposal on the surface of the Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU's compression.
The supporters demand that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a setback, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
In the Leave Means Leave event, Bone said in Solihull that he wanted to “take a Chequers proposal to go.”
He proposed that Farage be involved and that this should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough's representative added: \"I'm working on Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers' proposal.
He said: “We did not fight the world war to become subjects.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country.
Bone said that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is a completely incorrect statement.
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also took part in the march and said to reporters: “I only say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party or activists who really go to the streets and are, above all, responsible for our success.
Sign up for Chequers and start listening.
In a message addressed to May, he added: “The ministers will keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said that politicians should be under pressure if they intend to pass out the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about trust between the people and the political class, he said.
“They’re trying to water Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.
When speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to climb the Brexit, to feel the pressure on your side.
“We are going to mobilise the army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is an independent, autonomous and proud state.
Meanwhile, the supporters marched through Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small number of activists were embroidered by the Tories Against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked conservative security issues that they had with the party app at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the people who say they will get IT systems fit and all the technology for Canada plus plus plus plus, and undisrupted border operations for free Irish trade,” he added.
\"It's a complete farce.

Arrest in the LSU Sims shooting event
Louisiana Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that he was arrested by a person suspected of being killed by the LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 in the morning at the ET conference.
The police had released a video of a Friday shooting incident and asked for help in identifying a man.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in his head and died as a result,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247 Sports.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was in the interrogations, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do the arrest and was taken to East Baton Rouge's police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 in the game and 10 in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 songs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship offered him a victory from Sebastian Vettel
When Valtter Bottos passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it turned out that Mercedes’ team arrangements are a key player in the competition.
Bottas got a good leave from the Pope and left Hamilton almost his own fortune in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling his teammates.
Vettel went to the camp first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails that should have solved the situation.
Mercedes later went on the round and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed a little contact and the Ferrari driver moved from the internal line, leaving his defence to defend his investment after two thirds of the movement.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st anniversary, started on the blankets and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he extended the exchange of tires as he aimed at a quick stop and taking the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the hole in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtter was doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
The team has made an extraordinary career, reaching double victory, Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked on Saturday's statement by Senator Diane Feinstein that he didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the public, which accused the candidate for the Supreme Court, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual harassment.
When speaking at an event in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of human beings' courage, misfortune and dishonesty.
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we saw a hook, people who are angry, mean, evil and dishonest,” the president said.
“When we see publications and leaked things, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.\"
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you years old with this information?
Do you remember his answer... you're yearning for a document... oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
For years, we... no, we didn't leak, he added a senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford Kavanaugh's accusations and the letter was leaked into the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have happened in his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with her wishes.
But his ban was not good enough for the President, who commented on it on Saturday’s occasion: “I wish you that it was very bad for the body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I ever saw in the body language.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual harassment by three women, and considered the accusations of the democratic people to be of their own benefit.
“They have decided to get back to power by any means.
You see that evil and evil, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control, Mediaite reports the president said.

Analycyttika presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a re-treatment in which a man was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett proved hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on the cell phone when he collected one of the movements of a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received a number of mobile phone location data showing that Tellis had opposed his earlier claims with Chambers on the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the Tellis mobile phone was with Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
The second inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contacts of Chambers from his phone.
\"He wiped him out of his life,\" Hale said.
The final exchange of defence is planned to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to go to the jury later on the same day.

Another dark one?!
The New York Babysitter challenges the couple's court because of racist text messages
The New York Babysitter interviews the couple’s right to discriminate after having accidentally received a text message from the mother of the child, where she complains that she is a “get one of the dark people.”
The couple denies being racists and contrasts with the challenge of the “liberation”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed thirty when the new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived to work on her first working day in 2016 and told her that this was dark.
“EIIIII, TAAS TUMMONIEN,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice twice.
After understanding the mistake he made, Plasco-Flaxman, according to New York Post, resigned Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had been badly treated by his African-American babysitter and had been waiting for the Philippines this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple's right to get compensation for the divorce and wants to pay $350 a day for six months, for which he was originally washed to live and work in the family, but without a deal.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment relationship was a justified solution because they could not rely on him after insulting him.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racists, Joel Plasco told us about the post interview.
“But would you leave your child in the sight of someone you’ve been unfriendly to, even if only by accident?”
Your newborn baby?
Really.
Plasco peered with the challenge of blackmail and said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation”
Should we start hunting the other in such a situation?
It's not very comfortable, the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple’s social media, including their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the public would not be able to identify with the talking bear.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the adoption of the book, says in a letter: “It’s hard to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It’s funny now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known.
By stating that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about toys adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book was bitter because his father died last year.
On the other hand, he described it as a very important family member, and said his father was proud of the success he had achieved.
“She was a pretty quiet man, and not at all a glamorous guy,” she said.
“But because the Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement to him; one that you are proud of, even though it’s not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was about his creation, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been fascinated by a plane landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“They made a little difference and said the situation was really bad that he was not expected to survive,” says Ednan-Laperous.
Then they called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.
The medications that allowed doctors to keep their heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it all went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was over.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.
In the end, Ednan-Laperous, dying of his daughter's loss, rose to the plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the experiment he was currently going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous compassion for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Busty women send cards to stop suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son, Tyler, suffered depression at age 13, and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want anyone’s parents to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, in Lynney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious sneezing.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile illuminates the whole room.
But he quit his job before he died, because he felt in darkness.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his life away from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the side effects.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people who can go to talk to even if it’s a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of co-operation shortly after his mother had died.
“He didn’t tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
Before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was just in the country on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't take a look at them or anything like that.
He says Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they have to make it clear: \"It's breaking up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward.

Bret Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches its investigation
“I was thinking that if we could really achieve what he hoped - in time and in scope for a limited investigation - maybe we could achieve a bit of unity, Flake said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee was “broken,” the supporters caused by their deadlocks.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Opportunity is about timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be chosen will be hampered by the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to give them support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What happens after the FBI report has been prepared?
The Senate, currently sitting 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, when Vice President Mike Pence could blow across the game and strengthen his choice of Supreme Court.
North Korean dragons fall during Kim
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people trapped in South Korea from North Korea has decreased after the seven-year recovery of Kim Jong-un.
Park Byeong-seug wrote to the South Korean Department of Harmonisation and said that the strikes took place last year in 1 127 – in 2011, 2 706.
According to the park, the decisive factors have been the tightening of border checks between North Korea and China, as well as increases in prices for human transporters.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
In the end, the majority of North Korean lociers are offered South Korean citizenship.
It is said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected delimitarized zone between the Coreas.
China treats dragons as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often restores them.
More technically speaking, North Korea and South Korea’s relations in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, countries’ leaders met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the negotiations at the stops to break the nuclear armament.
This followed the historic meeting of June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach towards the Korean Peninsula's nuclear weaponry.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for putting sanctions in place after the meeting.
“I have no confidence in the United States’ national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be unilaterally dismantled by our equipment first,” Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh as a 'hysterer' and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
The minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's Judge-in-Office of the Court of Justice, Brittany Kavanaugh, said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your game commented on it in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called “hysterical,” Pelosi said in his own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate’s Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasay Fordia while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his emotions, and sometimes he cried and lost his speech when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic Members of the Committee without calling charges against himself as \"groteks and a planned person for persecution,\" which has been organised by the Liberals who have been angry with Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Your fear said that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that this is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be a party to the Democrats.
“I believe he made himself inconvenient in his statements and in the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats,” Pelosi said.
You were afraid of asking him if he would be charged with Kavanaugh if this choice would be strengthened and the Democrats would have received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Let’s say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not competent except for the Supreme Court, nor for the court in which he is currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugh was concerned about the possible provisions of the Health Reform or the Roe v Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judicial user.
In the consultations on his conviction, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the right moment for a hysterical and partial person to be elected as a member of the right and we would be expected to know that it is wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women need to survive everything
It is a legitimate fire speech when over a period of months and years of rage, and it does not make him cry.
\"We cry when we're angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, or what you think.
He continued: “I was helped enormously by a woman who was in a position to lead, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speaker in a situation where she was angry and began to cry: “You may think I’m sad now because I cry.
I'm really angry.
And then he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The cynics get the right to the rage as a landing route, even though they are generally misinterpreted.
One of the most memorable memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is when I once cried out of speechless rage and older woman - a cold-skick boss I had always been afraid of - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they're sorry for your mind.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 for a non-marital relationship with a boat named Monkey Business and got out of the race, a very frustrated Schroeder tumult that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“The candidates were already seven and the least needed one more.
Someone called the situation \"Lumiki and the 7th dwarf.\"
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind the fundraising, and so he announced that he wouldn’t go to the race if he didn’t get two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave men a thousand dollars only gave him 250.
“Do they think I’ll get something off,” he said.
When he held his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he had the power of his emotions - the supporters of gratitude, the frustration system, which made it so difficult to raise funds for the electoral work of voters and delegations, and the sexuality of anger - that he could not speak.
“I could have thought I could have had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press’s reaction.
“I could have thought Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone must be hacked into a memoir.
‘He cried.’
How the US and China trade war can benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S. and China’s trade war was cortex and, although the fight is anything but past, the country’s gap can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts find out.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the most important export articles in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties affecting the import resources for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded to the same amount every time, last time by imposing five to ten percent of customs duties on US imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be incarnation for a moment.
In order for Washington to be retreated, it should be given to its own demands, but for the public United States, worship would be far too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the dependence between countries.
“The political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start the economic downturn in any country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than the side blinds have so far understood,” says Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister said the country is ready to return to refugees.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek assistance in the reconstruction of the country after a devastating war of over seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country will improve.
“Your account is now more stable and secure thanks to the developments in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return to a country where they were forced to leave because of terrorism and their unilateral economic activities in their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem noted that the Syrian government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup’s victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the end of the U.S. team at 16.5 against the 10.5 Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in Europe. It has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points that were needed to win the United States.
The American star player Phil Mickelson had trouble with almost the entire tournament, and he hit his first shot in the water on the 16th route of par-3, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italian Molinari was brilliant in all rounds and became one of the four players who had achieved 5-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with the result of 5&4 European team's underprivileged player, against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
The world’s top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, who could now play the last Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder Cup’s golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, came to the tournament at a total of 25,5 Europeans.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything about it.
The year has been heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He moved the call to Jon Rahman, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the individual contests on Sunday.
“I feel a tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I am amazed at him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has Ryder Cup on 13-21-3.
Odds statistics from one of the best players in the past, which has won 14 big wins and remain only for Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was of high quality throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after his team failed: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressed the European team in the games this morning.
We put it in hand.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we move forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to pick up the hat.
We met our winner.
