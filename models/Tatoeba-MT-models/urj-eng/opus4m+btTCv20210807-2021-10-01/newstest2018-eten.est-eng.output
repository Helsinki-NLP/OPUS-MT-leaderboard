Four members of the Kemerovo Group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postimetist, the police arrested the so-called Kemerovo group leader Slava Gulevich, who is known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal gallery.
Gulevich was arrested in Spain with the permission of the court.
Yesterday the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called Kemerovo criminal community members are 27-57 years old, who mainly commit drug offences.
The alleged leader of the criminal community in the province of Malaga in Mijas, Spain.
Three men were suspected in Estonia, one of whom was collected according to the data to be the head of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the criminal offence in the Community had clearly been allocated tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal income, commented on the pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
“We do not rule out a growing circle of suspects in this criminal matter,” the prosecutor added.
It is also about people who have become interested in law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug crime.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been an important part of the whole investigation.
“International cooperation has become common for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation,” the prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that the detention was preceded by a pre-trial investigation of nearly a year and a half.
“In the first half of this year, long-term work was realized, and at the same time in Estonia and Spain the suspects were arrested,” he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officials were helpful in detention in Spain.
For years, we have good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card soldiers.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we can get them out of the other end of Europe,” Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, in the absence of liberty, suspects men may continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecutor sought their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the framework of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings of a criminal case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Office and the Public Prosecutor’s Office is led.
The Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevich in 2005 for blackmail and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be a second man in the world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
In the early 1990s, Gulevish, from Kemerovos, emerged in Estonia, when he began to engage in blackmails in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
The international joint operations, the confiscation of criminal income and the judgments which have entered into force confirm that the fight in the field of organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the so-called ‘Dikajev criminal case’, eight accused of which were confiscated with a criminal income of 80 000 euros, or nine persons in the judgment that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of smugglers and crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Eastern Estonia and South Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal income is approximately EUR 71,500.
In these criminal matters, success has been ensured by the daily exchange of information and evidence by police officers with foreign colleagues and, if necessary, by carrying out activities in any country of the European Union.
Citizens' Rights Group warns about travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against a state-wide discriminatory policy and racist attacks.
The statement of the Group states: “The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Massour, valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the state, taking into account the suspicious events of the entire race, which have occurred recently and have been shown here.”
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination cases, and the fact that the targets of state regularists are in an uneven proportion of minorities.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They pull the side of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said the President of NACP Missouri, Rod Chapel, President of the Kansas City Star.
“We have never had so many complaints before.”
This is the first warning that the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group referred to such events as racist insults in the direction of black students at Missouri University and Tennessee 28-year-old black-girl Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he got out of the state when driving through the gasoline and the Missouri police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report prepared by the Public Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black car drivers will be stopped in the state at 75% more likely than white people's own.
“The wisdom is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues for what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared, whether it means involving bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state.”
Based on the latest data of the FBI report on hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing a state-wide number of similar violations at the national crossroads in 16.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for the company to complain about housing or work in search of discrimination.
The United States of America Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local powers to arrest people for immigration violations, because ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides travel warnings for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the various forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, i.e. hepatitis, may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a low cost, hepatitis B and C is chronic, which may continue to develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver cortex and liver cancer.
The Health Board’s epidemiology adviser Kutsar tells us that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, frequent stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowness of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease comes from the popular name of hepatitis.
In children, hepatitis can occur without signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver-causing illness.
The famous Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
The hepatitis A viruses spread from the sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the outlet of the infected person to the food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug consumption.
The risk of hepatitis infection, or the risk group, belongs to family members and caregivers of the sick, people with chronic liver disease, people with a history of infection, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular, it is recommended for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hand before consuming all fruits and vegetables.
hepatitis B viruses are common in contact with the blood of a sick person, in the injection of drugs, in the tattoo, in the August, in the use of blood-infected olives (pharmacies, rations), in the use of donor blood, in the sex of a person with hepatitis, and in the presence of hepatitis disease to the foetus/symptonic.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes drug users, infected human sex partners, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and caregivers, health care, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other physical fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it is recommended that people with a risk group be vaccinated and persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: prevention of the use of foreign sanitary and manicure devices, other sharps and syringe needles, tattoos and freezing, and the use of condoms in case of susceptible sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a part of the National Immunization Plan in Estonia and for children free of charge.
Hepatitis C viruses are common in contact with the blood of a sick person, in the injection of drugs, tattoo, in the use of blood-infected olives, in the use of donor blood, in the sex of a person suffering from hepatitis and in the female/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes drug users, infected people's sex partners, men who have sex with men, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and carers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other physical fluids, people with HIV infection, and travelers visiting high-healing countries of hepatitis C.
The prevention of hepatitis C is: the prevention of the use of foreign sanitary and manicure devices, other sharps and syringe needles, tattoos and ice creams, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or as a superinfection occurs in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
The hepatitis D viruses spread to the foetus when exposed to blood and other body fluids, the needles that are contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mothers.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B viral loads and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
The effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D infection.
The hepatitis E viruses spread through fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-heated beef, fish and marine carcases, donor blood, co-administered syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
To prevent hepatitis E, hygiene requirements are met: wash or disinfect hands after treatment with the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid the consumption of drugs.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to break off the four-time Olympic winners, Farah, 34-year-old Farah, in the end of the day, won the time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long, drawing his wife Tania and children on the road after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the road with them was wonderful,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is a fifth title race in London, with a golden double of 5,000 and 10,000 meters running.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori-Daam dives into gold. Gustav Klimt masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait is an extraordinary story – from the birth story of one of the works of art to much deeper in the late 19th century and in the culture of the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more thoroughly in time.
For the information you want to know, perhaps the tougher flyer, a narrower theme would have been allowed in the title to gain more influence on the extraordinary story of the portrait.
There are now two books between one of the covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting “Daam in gold,” the story of Adelaide Bloch-Bauer, and a much more extensive and comprehensive historical book of respected Jewish families and German occupation, along with its implications in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a cultural life in the middle of a pulsating Vienna, and who was himself in the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life in Ringstrasse was around, or how everyone in the Central cafe turned their heads when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters in one of Europe’s richest cities was high and in the book you feel like a gram of culture.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where the valley was in the untreatment syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing to do with development.
Or perhaps, too, each paired coating adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of Travel to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
In the turn of the century, every 10 people in Vienna were Jewish.
At the same time, Adele’s parents were reinventors in Vienna, but by the time he married him twice as an elder in the Czech sugar miner Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for his famous paintings, his father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
However, Adelaide did not pull the glamorous life he belonged to.
When you look at “Dam’s gold,” it’s hard to believe that the end of life was infected by this great lady’s socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At that time, the Klimt order paid 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a land house with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits, the master’s love story was suspected was a model, the sugar magnate did not fall.
As far as Adelaide is concerned, the only solid fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor, \"Dam in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the beginning of the work, the Klimt had visited Ravennas San Vitale in a basil, and the researchers think that the brilliant mosaics that were seen there were the emperors from Theodore gave the artist an idea to make the golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaig.
Klimt presented his “Dam gold” in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (born 1907-1908) was born in the second golden land, “Suudlus”
The art historians did not notice the likeness of two women.
How is Hitler associated with the story?
“To commemorate my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handcraft available to the public,” wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist’s departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adelaide.
In his testament (Adele left in February 1925), he asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes for the Austrian Gallery.
She inherited her jewelry to her nieces Mary and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated, “Austria Mona Lisa,” had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts by 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw.
Although at times Hitler’s later anti-Semitism was considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his miners actually had a Jew.
In any case, the role of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria’s testament, had changed significantly in 1939 – it was important to find a pleasant job for Nazi parties from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art property was also suitable for some of Adele’s work at home, but not for Klimt’s.
Sixty years after Nazi art robbery began a ten-year dispute between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
In this respect, it is only noted that if the “Sun,” sees in the castle of Belvedere in Vienna, the “Dam’s Gold” of Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen in the New York Neue Gallery.
And before driving to Vienna, you can also read the book mentioned above.
Even if you don’t plan to look at Klimt’s work, because at least after closing the book, my emotions turned around more Nazi and Jewish themes than a $ 135 million painting and model around Adel Bloch-Bauer.
Not so much a portrait, rather a family destiny story - and a very moving story.
In the beginning of the book, the Bauer family tree was facilitated by the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m backwatering at 2.16.62.
Tipmark comes from a 17-year-old bishop from a week ago when Canada’s Junior Championships received 2.16,58, Priit Aavike’s Swimming Blonde.
Gold was the last one to go to the A-final.
In the final, he passed the distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Alina Kendzior, a member of the Estonian record (2.15.13), remained a bit more than half a second.
In the Estonian all-time ranking, Gold rose to third, and its new personal top brand is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m free-run and 200 m and 400 m in complex drinking.
Last week, Toronto attended the Canadian Championships in June and Gold made a successful start there.
He won 200 m in the release of the silver medal at 2.03.22.
It was so quickly swimd out by the front of the distance last year.
From gold to time, only the Estonian record label Elina Partõka has been swimming in Estonia.
The Estonians living in Canada won a pronksmedal in 100 m freestanding with an excellent personal record and a new top brand of the Estonian season 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has only been swimming this distance a century faster.
In the opening of the notice, he reached the top mark of the personal message at 100 m.
On a longer distance, he only reached the seventh place when swimming at the final, 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings on four different distances.
President Trump is on vacation, critics are eating teeth.
The time for rest is in place - it also means relaxation for President Donald Trump of the United States.
However, as Trump has still been one of the presidents who took the most holiday days, critics are already eating teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation in a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have already spoken for a week.
They throw too much rest to Trump.
It is a practice for the President to spend a weekend in its Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
In other words, Trump is not the most relaxed president in his 196 term.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but 21 days.
But Trump's going to forget things quickly.
The days after becoming president, Trump said, “60 minutes,” that there will be no time for long holidays during his motherhood, because there is a lot of need to be done.
He also expressed his anger about Barack Obama’s holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, he plays golf, goes to parties and jazz concerts, the heads of the ISIS magazines are cut off.
According to White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not a relaxation.
It is officially called a holiday during which Trump does not have time for reading or other activities of interest.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working time.
The air conditioning system in the West of the White House was replaced and the entire staff had to leave.
It also has Ovaalkabinet and other president offices.
“I don’t think any of you would like to be in the western wing in August if there were 38 degrees and there was no air conditioning,” said the White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during the holiday.
When President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get the idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the State Office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the dissatisfaction of the media.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn’t take long to get him out of the internal politics until he got out of politics.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't force his critics to silence.
For in 1783, Washington said that “free speech can be taken away from us, and dark and silently we may be led to murder by sheep.”
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan has blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU.
Kuberner’s officials set the action blank and web-commentariums curated from the reactions in the style of “Keda is interested.”
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it matters.
And it counts a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular republican governor in the democratic state.
The percentage of his approval is the second highest among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not thinking of a responsive hairhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, by showing his head loosely after the first time in his chemistry treatment.
Thus, the Governor’s page, which is a public forum with official markings, is managed by the blocking of people who are visiting the taxpayers’ dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan’s press agent Amelia Chase defended the behavior of the Washington Post in an interview with the governor, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers, or hate-filled people on the web.
The Post chatted with a number of real people Hogan blocked.
And that’s exactly what they are real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not obscene.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan’s Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not encourage anger, but about real hate crimes.
“I was politely disappointed because he did not react to hate crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in The Post’s news journal.
“I also don’t like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it a collective effort rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern to citizens.
What the governor’s office called “directed a spam attack” would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to collect and burn the newspapers with critical controls, or arrest the protestors and force them to silence.
But that's exactly what's happening, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for the bite of Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first significant judgments on this issue was held last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, a U.S. district judge in Alexandria, decided that the premiere of the Loudoun county supervisory board violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after the use of Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be so hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had similar effects than on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were shattered by his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to put an anonymous trolls on the chest.
People wrote letters to newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belize, and Portius, making Washington decisions in their country.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of a web-based George Washington letter collection project, he buried the office under petitions which criticized his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of speech, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable in the Renaissance Club
The former European pre-number Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable within the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course.
The Northern Irish who was leading the last round before Paul Eales on the Archerfield Links trails last year have started the new venue and performs the role of the winner and CEO Jerry Sarvad instead of the tournament ambassador.
“I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club in full shine with this event,” Rafferty said.
“People see the trail in their best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done a great job building this place.
He is an eager supporter of the golf game and is proud of his success here.
This will allow you to present the track in a great way.
The English Eagles is looking forward to protecting the championship for the first time, although the man has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year-old career.
“It sends a very special feeling,” he said in Southport.
“I couldn’t protect my Extremely Open title because it was taken off my winning calendar after a year.
It's magical to come back to it.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, the last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in the heart.
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of the Seniors in the beginning of the year, will return to the contest.
This is his first event in Scotland after his participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“The home to play is always a little more meaningful,” said Helensburg’s husband Orr.
“You want to do well, but you also feel extra stress.
I’ve enjoyed playing a lot again, and I’ve shown a pretty decent golf game.
I am happy with the way things have been going so far.
Trio joins the former Masters tournament winner Ian Wosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six athletes in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use a pen.
She rarely wears a pot.
In the wooden house in Enarotal, the invasion of the province of Papua, in the capital of the Pania Regent, the housewife, in local language, places a batat directly on the fire.
After half an hour, the scotched mule is taken from the fire and injected into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and at the same time he also does his daily housework, such as washing the laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the walk is filled with a bucket without roof in the room.
Since he is the youngest of four women, he is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the village's men to be unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to go around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the mountainous region of Papua. It is with the former Dutch colony, which was integrated under Indonesia in 1969 after the German Empire created a referendum that forced only 1026 seniors to vote under the eyes of the Okupun army.
The move of the Dutch supremacy towards its wrath quickly against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under its strong control, avoiding foreign journalists and human rights officers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotal is a very remote and abandoned place. To achieve this, a five-hour journey from the capital of Jayapura to Nabir is required to fly from the province to the province and then pass the five-hour journey with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo blades and covered with waves of iron roofs, which the roses have transformed into different shades of yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any aliens.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago’s beans worshiped God called Uga Tamee.
And other changes.
“We didn’t get used to wearing such clothes,” Degei says, referring to our colorful handmade turbine, dark blouse and bright skirt.
“Before that, we only carried the leaves of the plant on the body.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of Asia’s worst.
But this is also Indonesia’s golden land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of approximately 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the world's largest and most profitable gold miner Grassberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
Only in 2015, Freeport mined around $1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber stocks, with an estimated $78 billion worth of US dollars.
However, these wealth is the source of the sufferings of the popes, because they are due to the warming presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freeport paid around $20 million to local military and military forces from 1998 to 2004.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy are threatening this gold mine and they are rescinded in love with them.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 beans have been killed since 1969, and thousands of more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of the genocide in the mountainous lands of Papua Provinces in the 1970s was measured.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police region.
The 2016 report by the Bishop of Birsbane, “We are all losing,” includes evidence of the cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extra-judicial executions, torture (in one other report, particularly widespread rape and the provision of electric shocks) and the brutal extinction of peaceful demonstrations.
“The number of victims is difficult to read because such incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in the Human Rights Watch in Indonesia.
Kruvid is even more stuck, because Papua natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, as the population of Indonesia comes from Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumara and Sulawes Islands.
The Japanese family dishes sell gado-gado-gado with crisps and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market from local beans cheaper,” explains Abeth You, born 24 years old in Panama, who moved to Jaypura, the capital of the province for his work.
“The beans of the oil-seeds are therefore losing their market share,” he said.
President of Indonesia Joko Widododo, who is known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former knife was won on his way to Jakarta’s presidential palace from the 29 election districts of Papua, including Panama.
In Papua, however, very little has changed and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted by Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang a Christmas song at the edge of the fire, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark.
They were told that they should turn the front lights on.
According to the local pastor, Yavedt Tebai was offended by one of the soldiers on their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and spectators said the drunk soldiers were after the children and beat them with the handles of their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kids together.
One child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yemomo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral committee building was burned and the next day things were becoming more exciting.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice in the football field ahead of the local police station and the military control center.
They carried the ceremonial yachts and presented the Papua mee pago tribe of waita dance, during which they ran around and buried the bird song.
Some protesters began to rock the police and the military.
“When the mass of the people is more than three times resistance, shoot them off,” according to the official document that has seen the magazine TIME, but which has not been issued to the local media.
The oldest city of Kego Koto in Yereemia, Kayame (56) recognized the threatening threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,” he told the magazine TIME on the veranda of a wooden house in his bright colours.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the gathered soldiers.
“There was a lot of money, there was a lot of fire,” he added.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times.
“I ran to him and looked through his body to make sure he was with him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him...
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua Police told reporters that he was only subject to the security of his department because it was attacked.
“We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened to be killed,” said Komissar Pudjo Sulistiya in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapuras gave a passionate speech, where he expressed compassion to the families of the victims and promised to deal with abuses in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately that it would never be repeated in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would set up an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve the crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, the excuses were followed.
Most crimes have happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes,” he said.
On 5 June in Jakarta, Mr Wiranto took his words back, saying that he has no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua for dealing with complaints.
Instead, he said that “all will be resolved according to the law.”
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights in relation to the death of more than 1,000 people in the course of the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including in Panama.
The families of the victims of Panama accepted such claims with a dark umbus.
“I’ve been heard four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” Yohanes said.
“I’m tired.
He says he's still living in fear for years.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me, I’m afraid I’m being shot.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Panama were afraid to break this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped to bury four victims.
“After the burial of the dead, the army came to seek me,” he said.
Fires haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Pania neighborhood in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when he went into a call between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man-in-law, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Enemy visitors protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers set up policemen with stones, and the last ones responded with warning bills.
But according to the locals, the mobile Brigade (the Indonesian military police) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
“We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge,” said Dominggu Badi, 29-year-old, living near the hospital and seeing injured people in the field of entry.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament has called for the responsibility of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police's mobile Brigade from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the Mee, many, Dan, and Damal tribes living in the central mountainous region of Papua.
Many of them have joined the army of rebels (VPL) in the Free Papua Movement, which, according to itself, defends the rights of the popes by occasionally organizing attacks and kidnappings among the Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army, the defence of the sovereignty of the state, has, over the past few years, been arresting in Panama and holding thousands of people on their own.
Some of them will never appear again.
Pania is known as “a tragic forgotten place” among the people of Papua.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is the same unsatisfied.
People grow their whole food themselves primarily as a batat, in addition to a little fruit and leafy fruits.
It is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five batats.
They usually keep most of the yields for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten Batats pay only 10,000 Indonesian Rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has worsened between indigenous beans and new migrants, which have arrived at the opening of new routes at the Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist are better for educated and wealthy migrants.
Payees often lack capital or necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village, because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Governors of Panama.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on external media.
In the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were sent out of Papua, because “they did not follow the relevant practices,” although they had been given a rare filming license.
According to Phelim Kine, Vice President of Human Rights Watchi, the election promises of Jokowi have not been implemented to eliminate the restrictions imposed on reporters to promote transparency and development.
“In Indonesia, journalists who are trying to make reports of the most peaceful provinces in Papua, and Western Papua, threaten new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling look in journalism means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighboring neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “a wide range of crimes – in Papua, including in Panama.
These countries have also historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a press representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cast aside the allegations of the group, said Jakartas journalists: “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic order and freedom of the press, so that evidence of cases against human rights is difficult to bury.
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation first visited the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bara on 4 May Jayapura, the local people stopped attending the meeting, but anonymously, according to the source that wanted to remain anonymous, asking: \"We want freedom...
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Popes do not believe that they will vote again by Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but the people around him who are involved in the shooting in Panama,” Hobai, president of the council of the tribes.
He wants to tell Jokowi that, in addition to the fact that the people of Panama are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling because of the nigels of education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Panama, as well as the other beans, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokowi, which he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Pania shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic attack they buried one of the victim's dead bodies in the police station and in the country against the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on the feet, at least they will not allow the responsible to forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” says Yacobus.
“What else could we do?”
Dubai Torchi's cloud blower has already swallowed itself twice.
On Friday morning, the fire swung through one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai, forced hundreds of residents to escape from the height of 337 meters and the 79-storey building.
It's another fire that's been ravaged in just two years by a high-rise called the Torchi Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and screaming people.
“We ran down stairs and took about 10 minutes to get down to the 50th floor,” said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to Israeli civil defense officials, firefighters deleted the flame about 4 o’clock in the morning by local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for victims to secure shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of the world.
In the course of an investigation conducted after the fire of the Torchi Board in 2015, it was found that the most harm was suffered by the Fascists - the decorative panels and insulation of the external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation and facade panels of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
See: these phones will probably be selling buildings in the autumn.
In spring and autumn, technical fans have a sweet time, because then telephone manufacturers publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale, as well as in the autumn, new hits are expected.
According to Kristjan Seema, the CEO of Tele2 Marketing and Sales, the upgrades are characterized by an innovative design of the flag fleet, an ophthalmic scanner, a edge-to-side 4K resolution of the screen and a high-speed processor.
The great excitement was caused by Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales edge.
In autumn, it allows smart people to even avoid fast loading, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that, based on hearings, you can already make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to conquer the promotional sales tables.
These four top models of smartphones will reach the poets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the poets already in mid-September.
The rumors that the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not produce significant differences next to iPhone 6s, the 10th birthday of Apple is expected to be fully distinguished by the new model.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone’s front panel, lost on the home button and the fingerprint reader is built in the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been a ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the ophthalmic scanner, wireless loading and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is one year’s expected smartphone.
A new Galaxy Note 8 pre-order will begin on 23 August.
There have been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
It is reported that even more business users are designed, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one with a width and the other with a narrower view of the TV lens.
Currently, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
We look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones in front of Nokia 6 this year, it is still missing their flagship - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on August 16.
We are looking forward to Nokia's 5.3-inch edge-to-side screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
Nokia also speaks of aluminum housing and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two back cameras, which are produced by the company Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We look forward to a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated that its screen is at least six-inch.
As the reality brings, we can see the right soon as Sony has traditionally published its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to the transcripts leaked phone calls, Trump pressureed Mexico on paying for border damage
The Washington Post published the transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president broke up with him for the public condemnation of the Wall, saying: “You can’t say it to the press.”
Trump set up his presidential campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transscriptions were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who reveals a tension exchange of thought.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take refugees to Australia is a ‘female’, ‘brother’ and ‘dark’, he claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama’s government would leave him a ‘interpretation’ impression, as he has proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded by informing Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus routes from July 2019 to 2029.
This is my decision to reject the offer of OÜ MRP City Liinid at Tartu bus procurement, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Abihtin, the Head of the City Administration of Tartu.
This is for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Liins appealed to the Supreme Court for a ruling of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
Although many complain about the fact that the noise from the Wekend festival is disturbing their nights and the whole city is full of drunk celebrations, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I am even very surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any confusion or rudeness.
Even I saw the leave,” says Laine.
“It’s nice to come, be happy and enjoy Pärnus, which is like a winter bed,” he added.
Laine's sleep is not disturbed.
When she lived in the city centre, she heard that music was played on the beach, music has not yet reached her home.
“But I hope I hear,” he says happily.
Agnes, who spoke to the website, also says that the festival is good for Pärnu – it helps the local traders move well.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
There's no such thing as a party's wife.
Although I'm no longer on the beach, I'm glad the beach has survived.
And it’s nice that the people move and it’s been like this three times,” she says.
I think the first time it was a little worse.
“There may have been complaints,” he thinks.
The noise on the beach, however, is common for the summer leaders.
“This Weekend is a very good promo for our small town,” says Harri in the park.
The noise and the stomach have not hit his rhythm of life either.
What about what?!
We should all keep together.
Think of how this inter-national communication would be better.
There is no memory of a loud music man.
It doesn't bother, though I live near there.
“Good people can keep together, and there is no trouble,” he says.
Visitors to Pärnu are polite.
“Of course, they’ve exaggerated a little too much, but young people are young and the Lord’s God – give up, but be human, and we can do it,” he says.
By then, the coastal residents have traveled somewhere away, whether they are relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival’s life has a positive impact on people like this noise,” says Tiina, who walks with the children of Pärnu.
His family’s unhappiness doesn’t bother, though last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer there was another stage, then we heard more.
“We live out of the city ourselves, in fact, to get there quite well along the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson cuts more 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that he would cut 3,000 jobs and reduce his intermediates by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring program to solve the threat of business.
The lost jobs, which will be brought together by CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be in place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to 4,000 positions lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut costs by 300 million pounds under the third cost reduction programme (394 million US dollars) to try to revitalize a business that has received rapid digital learning due to the transition.
The company that agreed to sell the stake in the Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations in relation to the year have not changed since the sales revenue was reported in the first half of the 2.05 billion pounds of the year.

Konivore attack in Kabul: the suicide attack was killed by NATO's soldier
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked the military forces in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one of NATO's soldiers and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh region.
This bombardment is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that Thursday night an explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an explosive made by a human being.
According to the statement, everything is injured in a stable state and is being treated at the US Military Hospital in Bagram Airport.
According to Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) are an ever-growing source of concern for the forces in NATO Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people killed a major bomb attack in the city centre - most deaths have led to a military attack in the country since the U.S.-led forces have been repelling the Taliban in 2001.
This violence emphasizes the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. forces and police forces.
According to Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancelled the decision to postpone the suspension of the Regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew the decision to delay the establishment of an Obama-time regulation, which obliges states to limit the emissions of wolves, one day after the 15 states appealed to the Court of Justice due to this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue to \"a 2015 ozone-determination operations - late Wednesday, saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe that we need to negotiate and listen to dialogue with our partners from our states,” said Scott Pruitt, Head of EPA.
Pruitt had announced in June EPA's intention to postpone the determination of ozone in different parts of the country in order to determine where it should be reduced by one year to October 2018 to meet a stricter air quality standard.
15 Most of the democratic states, together with the Columbia Circle, filed an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling air containing ozone can reduce the ability of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party, as strong rains threaten the yield of the second wheat producer of the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that the rainy seasons that have lasted for weeks before harvest can mean that the cereals intended for the bread industry are suitable only for feed for animals.
“The quality of this is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015,” Agravis Raiffeisen’s analyst Bernhard Chilla said.
This year, up to 40% of the German wheat for animal feed, which is doubled compared to the usual, was predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
Winter was too dry first.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfalls, which continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five percent of wheat is harvested.
In most areas, harvest has not yet begun, the local harvester Ceravis announced.
“It’s been a very difficult day,” said Ceravis’ senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Compilation in everything, i.e. the designers of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the brass homes, because through large windows, the magnificent views of the Saimaa Kales reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, the attempt of our northern neighbours will begin to create both rough and perfect (energy-saving) homes at the same time.
The ability to use Finnish timber is worthy of the ability to build and finish, make furniture and beauty.
The refreshing techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fairhouses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is obvious that the compositions of black, white and grey shades, when they are supplemented by wood shades and toilets, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair lasts until 13 August.
Accessories and spices suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night against today was drawn to the Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything to remember as the last performer.
At the time of Garrix's performance, the people were really turned around - singing, singing, dancing with pride.
When Garrix ended, a common mass was scattered from the banks of Pärnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried for three days.
You must be some of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible conflict
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go to answers in the most attractive boxing boxing match in the near future up to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, in separate rooms until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council, walked the second end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization’s Sulgweight Championship.
After the victory of the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Garcia’s unilateral decision on Saturday, both fighters are part of the premiere of the weight scale.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, “How are you doing, champion?
I wish you success.
Lomachenko protects its belts against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posted, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that there would be a possible opposite between the fighters \"complete measurement\".
“I’m old-fashioned,” Garcia reminded me.
“I put up [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he has to move up the light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans wanted it.
Then let’s offer it to them.
Lomachenko agreed.
“The Pox world needs this fight.”
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to debut Lomachenko towards the end of this year in 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokautis) who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell’s match winner after their 23 September light weight draw at Forum.
“Looking at this fight could be reasonable, because fans have wanted this resistance,” Garcia said, saying later that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready...
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a strong fighter, and he could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in the praise of Garcia, saying that he thought he saw the three division champions from Riverside out “very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it all up.
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then pick it up.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension between them grew.
“This is a struggle that is waiting for realization.
No other match will cause so much attention and summation.
I'm more than ready to work for it,\" Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
This is going to be a good fight.
Which world corners are moved to Estonia?
Mullu renewed and issued a police and border guard (PPA) record residence permit for more than 13,000 third-country nationals who have traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, a temporary residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, then the tütumull was the number 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many migrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, this figure will begin to reach 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for the residence permit increased dramatically during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 earlier than the year.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing most in Estonia - the soil arrived in Estonia by 850 Ukrainian citizens more than left.
“Ukraine’s community has always been great in Estonia, and due to complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that the job and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of,” Kristin Rammus, a spokesperson at the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the most temporary residence permit has been issued.
If Ukrainians come here to work largely, then Russian citizens are traveling for family travel.
“By considering this historic Russian community, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, a migration scientist at the Home Defence Academy.
“If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved, after Harjumaa is immediately after East Virginia, he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu received a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend the residence permit decreased.
“The reason for this is that a new residence permit has been applied for instead of extending the residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia,” Rammus, a press representative of the Ministry of the Interior, said that Russian citizens’ interest in the residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who have lived for at least three years from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of adaptable people.
However, a long-term residence permit requires five years.
The new residence permit has probably also been reduced by extending the old residence permit.
For example, the soil was granted a residence permit for 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer make a mark on whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became a hoobly popular - for applicants, still grey passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people were granted a residence permit, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of applicants is 1269.
In ten years, a country with one of the most active Estonian residence permit applicants has become surprisingly a country from Nigeria.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigeria in 2007, the soil was 200.
Nigeria is going to study at this university.
Estonian higher education schools are also popular amongst the Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to their studies.
They also have the rule that where the community has come, it becomes easier for others,” Rammus added.
Over the course of ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a year receives about 6,000 third-country nationals, it is about 0.46 percent of the population.
Even if more European Union citizens think the migration remains about a percent, Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to the Statistics Office, 14 822 people moved to Estonia and 13 792 out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of migration.
Most people are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was reduced to 2,000 people.
The Estonians are moving in particular between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture Princess Fashion Magics With Sats, Tits and Tüll
However, for Maria Tammeoru, an in-depth idea gallery is a history - old paintings and costumes: “I have a few hours to dream in a museum and admire old sleeves and cracks.
If you do something with a passion, you will study and learn about it every day.
It's an discovery pleasure!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem like some kind of alien, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of my created haute couture dress.
For neither is it his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not walk on the red carpet every day, he wants to wear them the most beautiful dresses, and he wears them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and the gray everyday.
That is exactly what the idea of driving the plan to take high-speed in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people, to whom fashions often do not reach.
For example, the Mammu collection was presented on the Moealle of Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where a royal deficit with 45 models filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, it is often taken in the store, they are stacked with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - they call the bravo, they stand up, they want to thank you.
A large part of the audience came to reform, but now they are the fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they’ll be inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer trip with my way.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they were not coming to an end!
Maria also does not admit that the work must be presented to the superhero supermodel, she will delight in the stage of ordinary women.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always come with joy.
This is such a wonderful experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance before, I've always been behind the stage to give the most hopeless perfectionist to things.
My nerve would not allow me to look at the island peacefully.
Maria is the sort of fashioner who doesn’t just want to be in the representation role, but in everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process you play with details, you find out.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
It is not limited to design, but also to stylists, logistics, organization, organization - everything needs to be a day of one temperamental woman.
These hours are still huge for fanatics.
I can’t tell you when my work day ends, it’s just a day full of joy for me!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an endless happiness: I’m doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and in turn, compliments.
Many times I have been told that I have magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The rich tyllic sacires that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture.
Martin Mürysepp from the U18 boys: the arms of the Estonian subgroup were now turned against us.
Sorry, the fairy tale is over.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get into our desk.
And when there is such a difference in the table, there is nothing to do,” said 61:75 of Estonian U18 basketball boys in the UK, our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant Martin Mürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and had so much more attacks.
We were also not ready to protect or attack them, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build protection.
They were able to keep their hands between their hands everywhere, we couldn’t combine.
It hit the team's feet.
The work of the opponents was better done.
According to Mürzepa, Estonia would have to make more tactical mistakes to take off the attack.
On the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Atlerance and tightness, which was our weapon on the sub-group tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The Mürzepp remained in Kalev with his guardian, Matthias Tassi.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, so far, a single impact box.
I'm sorry you've met an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has always been self-confident and played his way out today, but it seemed he was tired - he's been carrying a pretty big burden.
But he did some pretty move I’ve seen before in practice,” he added.
Comparative numbers: in the female basketball box, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, the EMI B-divisjon basketball tournament in Tallinn is not only attended by young men, the women began over the age of Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland fell into the field of anti-renewals.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter there was a stop of 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16:16.
On both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, the third point...
At the beginning of the first two minutes, the Estonians caught two pieces of the first shot, but on the other hand 25 pieces of the game, one three in and then 21 in the left.
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 whiskeys were caught.
In addition, 2 points came from the four free spins.
There was a reasonable number of petitions during this time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a stroke of 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has begun two losses, the opening day had to recognize Portugal 83:56’s right.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO’s 1st Permanent Task Force arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled port visit for the weekend to supplement ship stock and prepare for the above exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and, at the same time, give crew members an opportunity for a couple of days of vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future search operations for historic explosives.
“The participation of Estonians in NATO’s unit and their co-operation in local waters is well reflected in our integration with allied forces,” said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Chief of Operation and Planning Division of the Navy’s fleet.
As of 29 June, NATO’s 1st military commander, Lieutenant General Gvido Laudup, who took over the duties of the Chief of Staff of the Estonian Marine Forces from the Taliban of Riga, Captain Johan-Elia, in Seljamaa.
The flagship of the Group is designated as the Latvian Navy Support Ship in the LVNS Virsait, which also operates the group’s command.
This semester also includes an international unit of the Estonian Navy's mine hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO's naval command is NATO's 1st mine control group, one of the first high-speed reaction units, which allians can send within five days to different locations in the world.
4. - Until August 13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, called by Maestro Eri Klas, is held 13 years ago.
This year, the Birgitta Festival is said to be a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented leader of Tallinn Philharmonic Art (36).
Risto Joost: To listen to the students, the classics of the opera world are called “Taviata, and “Tosca,” ballet responses from the enchanting “Bolerost,” a fun “Karlssonini” and also do not lack the plan of self-production by Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorium, the “Aacaders” of the same international creative team, who in 2015 brought Pirital stage Haydn’s second masterpieces “Looming” to the Pirtal stage.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre shows.
It’s bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
This is a festival whose snow will take power and never let go.
For the experience that the listener receives in this superior and mysterious environment will make human souls sound and affect human consciousness in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did the Maestro Different Glass shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Glass, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the division career.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue her work.
Erik Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team with so much goodness, and of course it all carries over to me as well.
It was great to join the team who knew exactly how things were going.
Just the great heart of the Erik Klas also gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could the audience be excited about at the festival this year, what special do you offer?
As a surprise, we have the first ballet from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and the first ballet that was written in the story of Astrid Lindgren.
\"Karlsson Flys \"
And one of the evil nuances is that the author of this ballet is Juris Karlsons, a Latvian composer who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He has probably lived in Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how are you doing all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I am lucky to have it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so much dependent on other people, as I am myself, or how I stand up to every new day.
And such conscious tone retention, keeping positiveness and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror, significantly raised my lucky percentage.
Especially this week, if you have the most important samples, I have practiced it particularly carefully and it works.
Smile for yourself activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a dictionary.
I don’t think people know half of things about their body, which the universe offers to them, but everyone does.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor's counter?
Yes, the clothes need to be changed for the more comfortable ones.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, I don't have a chance to rest or sleep a little.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before I step in.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here's what you can find for a friend of the opera and ballet.
Watch the moody video with Risto Jost!
New results of the tests for the age assessment of Swedish asylatlers were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among the asylatlers, during which their age was evaluated with a new approach to medicine. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were evaluated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) started with tests in the beginning of this year.
Tests were created to evaluate age more accurately in the course of applying for asyl after the Swedish Immigration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged refugees.
Currently, the Migrationsverke has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Court of Justice Institute has issued a total of 2481 test results from mid-March 2017 until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 years of age or older and, in the case of 25 more cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine evaluated that the test may be 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was “likely younger than 18”
The test is only used if the age of the person is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Judicial Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asylatlers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 tests in May and said that, in 442 cases, “there are indications that the person being examined is 18 years old or older.”
But if the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases were a person directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This method of evaluation of the medical age, during which the x-ray images of the wisdom teeth and the knee joints of the MRT, after which the dentists and radiologists are allowed to analyze them, have been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the Cardinska Institute’s endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include the assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed through puberty before or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the current measurement method should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t make a face so we can,” he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Judicial Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: “It can be said that the child’s impeccable adult risk of divorce is low.
The highest risk is perhaps about 10% if a person is a little below 18%.

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old lefter, made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MMI’s youngest female father, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately took my average score, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear,” Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s MMI debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainy Orel didn't interfere with it because he was training the winter through the TUT Stadium.
“I’m scratched,” he said with a little mule.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost full-house population, did Orel perceive people around himself or was it able to turn off?
I realized, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives - that's what it is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would stay in peace with MM’s debut, and he would be looking forward to a lot of good competitions: “I came here with the 32nd or last result of the season this year, I finished 18th.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm the only one who reads.
I take a good experience and some day I want to compete on behalf of the medals.
Governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
Governor Jim Justice of the Western Virginia Democrat announced that he would exchange parties with President Trump on Thursday night.
“May it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today, I say to you, having prayed and wondered, I tell you today, the West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
At the gathering, joy was expressed.
“I’m going to be a republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a treuner, I would tell you that it’s time to play another game.
Trump had previously promised a great announcement on the western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, the state's only billionaire was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and the coal business is his father.
His value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of Republicans (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that “the governor’s party exchange is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from making it better than working for it.”
“From the top of 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history, the governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent statement to the party that is at the end of the day, and is not able to find a positive and connecting message,” said Ronna McDaniel, president of the RNA, CBS News.
There is no surprise that where there are many people, there are many injured.
Urmet, who is a medical officer at the Week, told the newspaper yesterday that the patches had to be distributed quite a lot.
The flowers and berries are basic, out of the muffles and light falls.
Of course, head, back and foot pains too.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so the problems come.
Medicalians have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - have had a few panic attacks and also a foot fracture.
We’ve also made a stitch when a man has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams are done here, we're sending bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe accepted the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal.
According to his words, Sebastian Coe, the international noseman of the Light Force, said: “A sincere apology to Russia on Thursday,” because of the doping scandal, but repeated that it is not time to allow the country to return to sport.
Russia’s light-powered noseman Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress that the competition ban imposed on his country is correct and has a firm purpose to combat doping.
He apologised to “all the light-lifters from whom gold and silver medals have been cut off in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the competition ban in force, which was introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest response today, with a very honest presentation,” said IAF President Coe.
“The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance itself admitted that they had quite difficult times and they would do everything possible to restructure the alliance.
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
“I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the Group’s proposal that it is not the right time to withdraw Russia,” Coe said.
“We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Seventeen Russian athletes who meet the IAF strict criteria compete on Friday in London as neutral athletes.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia will not meet a number of prediction criteria yet.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that the doping control was still insufficient and the disabled trainers still operate freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Few of the fact that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mine giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies do not help.
At present, Glencore is serving coal and oil, but in the future, in the age of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel is growing.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and the Norwegian governments have raised their contributions to the expansion of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the cheaper Model 3 electric vehicle to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars will be sold for more than oil-producing cars over the past two decades.
“For some metals, it changes everything,” said Captain Economich’s raw material analyst Simona Gambranni Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalette and lithium, the demand for which has grown for many years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed in charging stations, so according to Exane BNP Paribas, it increases the demand for copper by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in battery demand for electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will receive revenue from the growing trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and from the fact that the world’s largest cooperative producer, the Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this broker company, the winners of other electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, the London metal exchange has increased by 70 percent from the cave.
The price increase was 37 percent.
The copper has also increased by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s share rose by 20% in London, having crossed the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton, and Anglo America.
On the losing side, companies dealing with lead such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of Plii is the batteries supplying the starters of petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
“This is a serious risk to the demand for lead, unless there is any other purpose to overcome the decrease in demand,” said Michael Widmer, Director of the Industry of America Merill Lynch.
The impact of the trend that has not yet been disrupted has not been observed in the face of the pli price movement.
Plii has increased 17% this year, with the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal far away in the future.
“I’m not sure it’s so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive,” said Triland Metals’ sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
It may happen in about 10 years.
However, the harsher exhaust standards mean that hybrid car demand, which is dependent on advanced lead-based batteries when starting frequent engines, will be evaluated by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as the lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This is already explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total production of aluminium in the world.
This trend is probably getting worse, Widmer said.
Aluminum has increased by 13 percent this year, as the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of amazing car frames.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
“The high-speed steel should be the answer to this development,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of oil can also bring suffering to the platinum.
The soil took about half of this precious metal diesel engine to catalysts, said the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
“At present, raw materials with high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahahah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plastic manufacturers believe that there is a continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, the leader of Uncore, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars are still sold from full-electric vehicles.
In the 10 years’ time, the large hope of platinum producers is on hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has still not justified itself commercially.
“Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Exane BNP of Paribas.
In July, German car manufacturers became a part of the big feedback, as Stuttgart court banned the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar’s transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germany.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the management body that governs the European game and has the power to prohibit the participation of the team in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still waiting.
The financial rules of the UEFA 2011 fair game (FFP) mean that PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without enormous losses.
For Barcelona, 222 million euros ($262 million) were paid exclusively to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymari’s salary will begin to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of Neymar's financial aspects of moving to the French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly have the opportunity to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starring rivals, given that the team is financed by the family of the Katar energy offender.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in football.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who are falling into large debts in search of success are actually engaged in fraud and risking loss if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of the FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a potential club and then make large expenses to make the team better and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which lasts until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was expelled from the presidential office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cefer, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
“FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules,” said Andrea Traverso, the Associated Pressile, who is an supervisor in UEFA.
While PSG paid for Neymar’s acquisition clause as a single full payment, it is possible for them to allocate that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, making it possible to show the transitional fee for the next five years as a sum of EUR 44.4 million per year.
With regard to the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, along with the Manchester City of Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties on the neck.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at this time $82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the League of Champions to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over regulatory financial institutions by raising their incomes through companies related to the owners of the club.
However, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was done in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG’s value of support was restored.
It has been said that a certain part of the service of Neymar PSG may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Championships.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymarist could become a world champion and that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any aspirations to ignore rules.
People who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar with PSG.
They talked to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of PSG.
Recent reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in revenue during the 2015-2016 season at approximately EUR 542.4 million in turnover.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset by leaving one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“This is a clear “financial doping” case with the club and the state,” La Liga said President Javier Tebas in the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that the PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sportsman, shares the attitude of La Liga that the state finances the club.
“This is the result of ownership rights, and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the game because the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country.

Today, 50 years ago: the storm of the hurricane in Estonia, which torn the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which, on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, in particular to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In North-East, the wind was more than 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from the tree in the garden to the other side and looked at them with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and fierce, like the end of the world.
At the same time, the roofs were already flying from the houses, and in 2002 the old lady Linda Kurova Haapsalus was reminded of an interview with the Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw her planted garden collapse.
But what are you still supporting the trees with your hands, where do you get that storm?
\"The sea came under the window, the windows in the water,\" said Mrs. Linda's tone on the street of Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most Haapsalus only the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some were completely down, some were in half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees as a rag and a pragina like a war.
West Virginia did not suffer particularly hard in August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damage was high there, the Official Journal of Virumaa wrote in 2007.
The Haapsalu Loss Park and Padise Park were erected on the ground, but also the parks of our candle were severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn, on the 6th of August, a little girl called: “Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be down,” he wrote.
During the storm, the building of the Põll Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed so much that it was decided to be destroyed later.
Augustistorm did not withstand the constructions of the Türi ski mountain, which was no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and the inhabitants could be involved in cleaning work.
There was also a lot of damage to the crops in the storm, and the newspaper said, “partial organisations must be both encouraging and directed in the repairs and the harvests.”
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969 when Ruhnul was measured as a wind speed of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaedloo, the measuring instrument broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of soft bathing beaches: night cleaning work and poor beach weather
The cold summer weather also means a smaller harvester in Tallinn bathing beaches.
“If there is no air, then people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people,” the beach cleaner says.
On the beach of Northern Tallinn Stroma, the pebbles are evaporated.
They offer melodic competition on low-speed rotting tractor that climbs down the stripes on the floor.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep through the sand, picking out the seagrass and the rest of people left behind: bottle caps, cigarettes and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people,” says Alexander Usov, the manager of the Haabersti Management.
It's 6:30 and there's a bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at eight o'clock, the place must be good for people.
Usov is already at 4 p.m.
After Strimo, he will keep an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Lake Kakumäe and Paljasaare on the Pikakari beach.
The quantities of waste have decreased.
Years ago, it was much more than that.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has cleaned the beach for 15 years.
Before something new came up, it was already broken the next day.
Now it's what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest works on the shores of Estonia is the cleaning of the sea-grain, i.e. the adru.
For example, the Pirita beach must be transported to 400 000 tonnes after the beach season.
“This is an incredible amount,” Usov said.
The second large category is the same as all that people leave behind.
In a semi-kilometre coastline, the Stramoma beach strip has eight large landfill containers that need to be emptyed three times a week.
There's so much rubbish coming up.
However, colder summer weather has meant that rubbish is less than a fifth.
The third species form abandoned things.
Mostly these are children's lives.
This time, Usov has cleared a dozen models from the inside of the sand.
They remain waiting for the owners to take the beach.
“Of course, they come out more, but it’s a normal harvest,” Usov already knows that he will soon find them in the sand again.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Prune is scattered
Erika Scheller, a representative of the administrative services of Haaberst, acknowledges that the screening of the tractor is disrupting locals.
A noise that lasts from night hours to early morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
It is impossible to work on the day.
In one month, the beach has to be doubled.
“If we don’t do this, the part of the city will punish us,” Scholler said.
However, the goal is to get the Stramo Beach International Bluewood Quality Label in the same way with Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
“In comparison with Europe, Estonia has much more work to ensure that the beaches are maintained,” Scheller said.
We have more adru and stones and harder to rub on sand.
There is less rubbish in our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
When you hear that there is rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near the Beach of Strimo, enters the conversation circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a picture of a balcony everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle caps that have pulled trash bags on the back,” says Martin.
Although it’s hard to assume that people can change their behaviors so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with rubbish boxes and put on their covers, for example, to prevent birds from reforming there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the Stramo Beach.
The city will take care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, the rollers were only allowed to drive on one road,” Martin notes.
The discovery of treasure in the Strip: coins, only coins
In the morning, 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use the measuring season, who, as a treasure switch, is climbing the beachside with a metal detector.
He doesn’t think anything will be priced in the future either today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been dealing with it for a year and haven’t found anything valuable yet,” Dmitry said.
Hobiardektuna has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails in the Dmitry treasure box, which later throws in the trash bin.
Usually there are coins.
“There are no ears, rings and other legs,” the treasure hunter says.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the former level, as the economic growth and mitigation of inflation have softened speculation on the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain a hit, as the income of households has put interest rates on expectations.
Policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of holding 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members will require an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% and by 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes persists, as inflation is still expected to rise by 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in rates is necessary to control inflation due to Brexit over the next few years and that a higher expected increase in loan costs may be necessary in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of partial withdrawal of the marketable mammoth package, which led to Brexit.
In February, the Bank will terminate a fixed-term financing scheme that will provide cheap financing to banks, although it has now said that 15 billion pounds of this scheme will be expected to have a larger bid of 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the decision on the definition, the Bank says: “The medium-term forecast of the euro area’s gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income in households will continue to have an impact on consumption.”
It was repeated that, to mitigate inflation, it is necessary to \"take some effort on the financing policy – and to the extent that “very much greater” is expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second rise in 2020.
But the bank pointed out that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and for the next year are comparable to the forecast for May by 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of the 1.8% increase in 2018 remained.
After this news, the pound rate fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to $1.31 USD and 0.4% to $1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointment in the growth indicators that have reduced the growing hopes of increasing GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% to 0.3% of GDP in the previous three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it begins to accumulate a little bit.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice in rising inflation and poor wage rises, saying that the situation will get a little worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting in the next few years, but a significant recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to weak pounds, the economy is also encouraged by growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come after one year after the rates were taken in August by 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully breathe into prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision was to feel the growing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in the toughness of the household; in July, three policy makers required an increase in the rate of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank’s message was expected and the next few months is expected to rise again.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2 percent goal was due to a completely weak nail.
Andrew Montlake, Head of the Coreco mortgage brokers, said: “In view of the recent decline in accident rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those who are starting to complete their transactions, as refinance, often unpaid and low rates, has become increasingly popular.
NHS has been writing a problem for 10,000 people with HIV.
Patients have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention after the battle in the Supreme Court to see if NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England reported that during the initial three-year clinical trial, national health care is estimated to make up to 10,000 people in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets that are given prior to the intercourse and have shown a high risk of infection risk in humans by approximately 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution's own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the executive director of NHS England, welcomed this move on Thursday as a “new extensive intervention” while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as “a turning moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is launched in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that are taken prior to intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Before taking PrEP, it means that the human body has a sufficient amount of certain medicines that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the intercourse.
Appropriate candidates include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-infected partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor can also register for their participation in the local sexual health clinic in the program.
The program costs 10 million pounds and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new extensive intervention should complement and leverage a wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against HIV spread.
This is another milestone in the struggle of more than three decades with one of mankind’s greatest health problems.
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and is not dependent on a partner, thereby improving many lives through this NHS-funded clinical trial.
We warmly welcome this announcement.
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins, said: “It is important to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is rapidly delayed and that none of the members of the HIV risk group are excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been acquired, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV.
Public health shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the clinical trial in PrEP has been very welcome and very late after the six-long delays and the government’s legs were dragged.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to the prevention of HIV and the end of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us a step closer to the full understanding of PrEP’s advantages.
It is now important that a clinical trial is taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to bring us closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
The difference between the next day’s stock exchange price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to EUR 1,94 compared to EUR 7,71 in June, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish community failure.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity last month was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros from the megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and seven percent respectively.
The electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75% from last month’s hours to Estonia and 16 percent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the next day.
For 99% of the time, the electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia to Latvia, while 73 percent of the hours were in use all the transmission capacity.
According to the transactions held on the last day of July’s trading, Nasdaq OMX’s market can become an electricity exchange price of approximately €34 and in September 37 from the megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
High living - semi-storey and smart design buttons have transformed it into a small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Legh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate refurbished, changed his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 to Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed his home and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“Before I lived on a much larger surface with my former partner in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I bought something that would be equivalent to my price.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment, and it had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.
Since the first visit, this 93-ruth apartment has completed a complete innovation course.
At first, it was a one-bedroom and a complex placement apartment - it was necessary to walk through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to make use of high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
They were my demands,” he said.
He hired architectural and design studio at Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was architectural challenge to create a semi-storey where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“The metal structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We had to restructure the rooms, so they were on top of each other, without having to get a little bit in.
It wasn’t just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower space would be correct.
This setting allowed Erfan to create two full-fledged rooms in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
In the semi-storey floor, the old light opens to the glamorous living space under the view of the Retrouvius window.
The golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and retro-circuit Sergei Mouille's luminaire emphasizes the style of space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and lighting.
In both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall of the other window opens in the room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all the meals and glassware of Joanne.
The living room adds the magic option to close the kitchen section unless it is used by creating a more glamorous space.
The kitchens are not new.
This kitchen, however, is a unique fact that it is a type of garage with a lifting door.
“There went a little design gap,” explains Erfan’s steel-backed MDF door.
“There is a counterbalance, so it dissolves very easily when it is pushed up.”
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra roubles, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, the floor floor is what you sell, or what gives value to real estate,” says Erfan.
\"The real estate broker enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the area of the floor.
Here they have managed to increase the floor surface, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“The materials are the ones you touch and thus help create an emotional bond with your home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the heart sound.
This shows that a good design and increased area will help to do a pretty normal apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Chief character Dane Jensen is a Chicago sky-scraper-based bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for a professional promotion.
It does not count any amount of money other than earned, with which any ethics is forgotten.
His wife and three children only see him early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it’s like Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler.
The more the film goes on, the less the chamber-house element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers is beginning to appear more and more and more.
As a life-changing experience, the main character of the child becomes cancer.
There is now a choice between working and family life.
The boy who dreams of the Architectural Board puts his father on walks to the large buildings of Chicago to think about real important things like faith, goodness, love... without touching even the two-throat disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, the feeling that the filmmakers are based on the goal of the audience to cry, as even the most glamorous looker can’t keep the tears back in the sight of the dear cancer patient’s boy’s suffering.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father will be able to fully understand the morality of his work and make a good work for the old man looking for a good job.
Now I'm betting with myself - if the movie has a happy ending, I'm going to premiere my transparency after the movie's coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the script can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm missing coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and the man storms down the hall to the palace.
However, the Son is wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can already predict the end of the American drama!
By giving the truth the film is well-designed, all the necessary elements exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess this movie will bring you in.
Trump’s new human resources chief is planning to limit the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually handle it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the water.
Here is a bitter reporter from Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff at the White House, met with high officials on his first working day, he brought out the key problem in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve the poor information in the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because she would make better decisions if she had to share good information.
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track Trump's media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back to decades, and now that he’s in the White House, his TV shows are not gone anywhere.
“If the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, he was also shown that he was well-known in the publications that were also in effect,” said Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor, Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “the six former campaign workers say Trump is the key to managing Twitter habits if he ensures that his personal media consumption also includes guitar singing in a stable manner.
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s use of Twitter has ever been “controlled,” is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s calls would have been even more sneezing without their interventions.
We'll probably never know what Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from constantly creating the myth.
Some of the problem is that people in the White House, consisting of competing clips, are trying to promote their own interests without exception, by supplying Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico wrote in May about the tendency of advisors to feed the president strategically on the questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
“Prayers and former Trump under control say that Trump may react to negative press, especially for information clips with damaging effects, explosively, taking into account their source of source.
This was the case at the end of February, when a copy of the website of Charles C. Johnson, a printed on the President’s website, named GotNews.com, accused of being a source of information from the White House.
It doesn’t matter if Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of a perseverance, or that he didn’t offer any specific evidence, or that he has also filed false accusations in the past and taken them back.
Trump reads the article and began to inherit from the subordinates about Wash.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Director of the White House Office Rob Porter had tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump.
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he becomes a more effective leader in Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for the impact.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don’t get permission to appear bitter.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city centre.
The ones that the evening spoke to admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
We first found three street musicians near the Viru Gates, who had brought the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear to see that musicians wearing rastapats and loose clothes were backpackers, and one shower would be taken off.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a fun rhythm story, while one man next to her in a three-ball juggler and the passers were called closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one backpack and smoking in the heart row himself ready to screw up.
The three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who was playing with Noem and the balls, told me that they would play music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the meeting was to collect the ticket money for a ship flying to Finland on the same day.
Asked if they asked the city for permission to play music in the old town, Noem and Bob's head were shaking.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and in most cases we will be allowed for a month or something like that.
It doesn’t make sense to pay for it,” Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the Viru Center’s intersection with happiness.
There were also three half young men on the streets of Viru, one of whom played violin, the other clarette, and the third had brought an electronic piano.
“We are here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living,” said Mivosh, a trio pianist.
Mivoshi says they are aware that there must be a city government permit to perform.
“We don’t have it,” he said.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try, he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July under the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, the bond portfolio of the central bank increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not disclose detailed information about purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained, in response to the inquiry of the members of the Riigikogu, that the asset purchase plan of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: financial sector bonds (covered bonuses), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank will purchase bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases decreases the yield of assets with a lower risk and motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, in the framework of the public bond purchase programme, each central bank will purchase bonds from its government, and bonds from other countries will not be purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make them so-called replacement shares within the limits of the amount allocated.
The replacement purchases also make central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank of Estonia is generally purchasing bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank bonds, with the approval of Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were acquired, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering’s bonds.
The Central Bank of Finland will buy both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks from June.
The travelers ignore the crane and return to the \"millionaires districts\"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have once again come to a fierce contrast with the decisive migrants who have ignored the graves of the council's mine to win back the field away from their villas.
The tourrs have parked their 20 trailers in the field for the wealth of millionaires, baptized near the Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were thrown out of the corn, not to let themselves be confused with the ditch that was mined by the council to prevent their invasion.
The Tactic group found a weak place in the protective boundaries, poking its vehicles through the unblocked part of the unblocked part that had been left on foot.
The people of Maruvhas have absoluted the Solihull Council, saying that the council is useless to deal with the problem.
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they created passers with stones.
The Council should be ashamed to act because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The fans were there in May, they were out of time, and now they're back.
They came last night, probably even more today.
He added: “The Birmingham council knows how to deal with such things by buying long tips to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the council fee if the council cannot even prevent such a thing.
One local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: “This is ridiculous. We only saw the last of these migrants leave, and there is already a new attack.
This time the number has increased, and even the horse has been seen in the grassland.
A representative of the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that in the country around the Streetsbrook Road there is an unacceptable campground, and we work with the Solihull Police. We will implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
When collecting evidence, it will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.
Wekend Festival is also visited by the cultural minister Indrek Saar, who is pleased to have been able to bring the top names of the real world to Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians is answered by Saar that it should be asked of all those who were enjoying the three days of the festival.
However, he finds that the true performers of his field have come to Pärnu.
“When looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home - often that is not what happens in our entry,” the Minister of Culture said.
What festival artists do most talk about the island?
I think of myself as a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren, who came up last night.
According to his record, all of us have at some point turned their feet,” he says.
But he still brings out several names, such as Chansmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, also our Estonian artists: starting with NOąP and they can be read throughout the series.
In reality, the concentration of known names is very high,” he says.
Look at the video of the website for a longer time!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism hit by car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said that it offers software improvements to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to BMW’s president, “there are smarter options than driving restrictions, referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles to reduce diesel emissions in Europe.
No company described these actions as a return.
European automotive producers have advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be cancerogen and can cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment installed to neutralize emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While the German automotive producers are under a thorough investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of disabling powerful car manufacturers and disregarding the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which slowed down the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which allowed the exhaust gas display to be adapted to regulations during the test of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged with charges in the United States and others are under investigation in both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Head of the Department of Thermodynamics of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from issue and may go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was drawn to a criminal investigation on Volkswagen in Germany, where authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent the requirements of European exhaust emissions by extending the investigation which had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation can be a huge blow to Volkswagen by the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools are purchased for €20,000 for the European Union flag.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the European Union flags to mark the Presidency by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag will be awarded to 570 educational institutions.
Tickets are intended for exhibiting indoors, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in indoors with tunnel fastener, the ERR news portal is transmitted.
The flag guard has the text: “The gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is €20,000 at the Ministry of Education’s price, one flag costs €35.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes a growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the week newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and uninterrupted drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
It is said that it is important to change your routine.
The two parents discuss which seems safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the top of the room: “The enemy, “Neutral, Allied,”
They ask reporters for names in every column to provide no evidence, enough impressions and inner feelings.
There is a suspicion of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is not a matter of breathlessness, and the more deaths across the country are accumulated, the most of them are reported by journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, as of December 2012 by President Enrique Pena Nieto, at least 25,589 journalists have, after attacks and threats under national protection, and over that year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last deaths include their editor and inspiration source, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a great picture of Valdez with a letter “Justice,” and two in the 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt, which has been portrayed with his smiling glasses or a hat hat hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. The reporters discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoid.
Although a separate state prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted by the Data of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Like most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists rarely get to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, Ibarra said that there is no good for the security meeting.
“It’s so stupid to waste your time at this meeting,” he says.
“As long as the reason is not known, you’ll be all over the world.”
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on May 15th.
He managed to drive only a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corola. He was forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times. This is expected to be due to the name of the newspaper, which means, translatedly, “the 17th River,”
The armed man drove out of Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left with two adult children.
The rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release of the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, because rivals fight for the execution of the power force.
It doesn’t matter that some people are shot off on the streets of Sinaloa every day or a lot of people, or that the cemetery is abundantly decorated from the mausoleums of the two-fold drug cumins, which are larger than the homes of many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel is led by valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the risks associated with his work, Riodoce is a co-founder and manager of Ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the enormous guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that the killing has encouraged two mistakes.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with the noseman Damascus Lopez, who competed with Guzman’s sons and was the screen of the war.
This book may have been angry with the boys by suspicious gang members buying all copies of the edition as soon as they arrived in the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a branch occurred in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was always there.
He worked in 2003 as a veteran reporter at Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas “was impossible with the press without dealing with the drug problem.
The newspaper gathered in time the reputation of its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish strong studies without fear of censorship and readers in a snowy print they could read about stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot prize for its Latin American imagery.
In the same year, the Valdez Journalist Protection Committee (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of Journalism for its courage to follow Mexico’s drug history wherever it leads.
He admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said.
Last October, he told the television on Rompevito TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on a task that is accompanied by a journalist’s office by a second opportunity to play stupid.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t talk about what was going on.
Riodoce’s collective longs for Valdez, a joker who rose like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared the embus and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar on the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became his destiny.
His death has also made them doubt how to do their job best and stay alive.
“They don’t like the rigidity of their women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
“These things were not to be touched,” Bojorquez said.
Even in the best times, the result is strong self-centered and self-determination.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is, “The brain can be tricked... and that’s how this happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or other states that are home to profitable shopping routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce workers got together for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only the nudity sold to governments was used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from 40-degree heat in the shade of the tree.
The government ordered them to watch Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters considered that these police officers belong to 50 percent of the police officers whose governor himself has considered untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous locations where control is in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce’s release this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former poker legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official notice of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant is an attraction for both drug dealers and authorities.
The Reporter became aware of public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who was part of the powerful institutional Revolutionary Industry (IRP), which dominated all policy levels over the past century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread coverage in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was named El Chapo, escaped from the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for Valdez column to get information about the best sources of kidnapping.
“We had never known what happened before,” said Villarreal, 46 years old, whose kleenuke bodybuilding has served him as an nickname El Flaco.
“Now all communication channels are broken with our sources,” he said.
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the staff of the agency has become something they never expected to expect from activists for the press.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of still and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the killing of Valdez in the West of Michigan.
It is found that the dead body and officials say it belongs to it based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more pronounced all over the country and criticized as an organized protest for the walks and buildings of the phrase “SOS press”
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to gather international support in Valdez's case to put justice on the feet.
The day after the death of Valdez, when he met the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez accused journalists of spying and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be directed to reflecting government activities elsewhere, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are organised by crime, co-sponsors and a society of indifferent people, \"inline\".
In his last book, “Narkoajakistus,” he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug addicts, but also by the command of politicians and security forces who are organized in the field of crime.
The media monitoring team Articulo 19 last year attributed more than half of journalists to police and state officials.
“You will die because you are being silenced,” Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously bloody.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: “I’m here for my reports.
The computer keyboard and headphones were found next to his cut head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chile after killing their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others will pass on as they did in the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke of the drug cartel, with a guide from the front cover, “What do you want of us?”
Some journalists have left their country or even their country.
It's an obsessive decision.
It is hard to find work in the ancient world, and they still have to hide the streets in order to avoid threats.
And sometimes they're behind them, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in one of Mexico's apartments in 2015 three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that a drug dealer’s recognition scares him.
“Mehiko is on his way to hell and that’s why I started reporting,” he said.
One of the most recent nights, when the latest number had already been hit, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office and threw beer when all the phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort in Maztalta, 19 people were killed in the exchange of rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to be escalated, as promised by the left-on messages of several cartels found in the region.
On the same side of the road, reporters put news on the Riodoc website using the mobile phone.
The first of the next day needed a change.
There was another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez was hiding at the police station to see if they were guarded.
When they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, where his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees carried out his tracks.
“How could you even think of closing,” said Bojorquez, “as the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to make a report.
Dinosaur used protection color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, though quite scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings in relation to the discovery of the incredible nasal size of the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as “the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with its beads was red-brown color and his past had been somewhat \"hard\".
The report published in Current Biology described the essence of “the best preserved pancreatics that have ever been found,” and “one of the best dinosaurs all over the world.”
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the critical age, 110-112 million years ago.
This incredibly good survival of open scientists who describe it as “very significant”
According to the National Geographic magazine, this warm-covered vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk found it when he mined Suncor Millennium in a mine near Fort McMurray in North Albertas Canada.
He hit something that didn’t remind him of the surrounding stone, and decided to explore more closely.
An open fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were worked to dig the animal out of 2500 pounds (1100 km) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is finally ready to bring the public forward.
“When a little eye is cut off, you can almost believe he’s sleeping,” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where his existence is exhibited.
“It goes into one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs in the scientific history – Mona Lisana of the dinosaurs.
As he studied his skin, scientists found that this vegetarian, which is covered with warms and resembles a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by meat-food dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used a red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique called resistance and used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed dinosaurs to dive better into the surrounding area and avoid enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs came to the news for the first time in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied and named it after Mark Mitchell, the laboratory of Borealopella's Markmichelli Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in the effort to reveal the animal.
Thanks to the amazing maintenance of the individual, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the wishes on the body.
They discovered the threat - the protection method common in the animal state, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although resistance is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borelopa is much larger than the animals living today.
This suggests that the dinosaurs had enough activity to hunt other muscle-eater dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of the resistance to survival.
However, most animals using modern resistance, such as deer, sebras or armadils, are much smaller and more vulnerable as a yield, which suggests that nodosaurs had to really work to survive.
“The powerful hunting of the dinosaur with a huge and abundant warmness shows how dangerous the dinosaurs could have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the intestines also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red pepper.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river, thereby reaching the sea with a flow, where he leaned in front of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to spread far beyond the inland world as it is now.
“This nodosaurus is really significant, because it is fully covered with the skin of the cream, but it is also three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as in a critical age.
To reconstruct it, you don’t need to use much imagination – it’s just enough to wash your eyes and it seems like he’s sleeping.
The time of crisis was the time when the vast two feet of the meat-eater dinosaurs - teropodoids.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Boreelolopa, some of his terrifying predecessors could hunt for it.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons weighing monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Boreopella was threatened after the death of the sea and that mumphistry mud.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the existence when he mined the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albertas Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world, including skin and warmness, and it is a complete contour to the hips.
These characteristics were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of butter came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this plant eater covered with sodas was adventured through the present West Canada until the flooded river threatened to open it.
However, the dinosauric sea-based burial site helped to preserve its warmness in a very detailed way.
The stoned remains of this particular individual are so well preserved that the head bones of the dinosaur are still covered by the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “The same degree of durability is as rare as the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The dry skin remains are still covered by the Mygarous Warmboards on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg rests next to him, and five toes are stretched up.
I have the opportunity to read his wishes in the winter.
How did an activist answer the question “Who are the streets”
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, it sat in a room rented through St. Louis's resident Airbnb by browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got into the post of his former partner.
He wrote: “I have just killed a 18-year-old boy, and he still rests on the street.
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The posts of the user of the Pidemega @TheePharoah were repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's region sent a real-time tone about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was not something new for him or his community.
He put away his phone, but later he saw a resound on the Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, and still kept a note, \"Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son.\"
He looked at a real-time stream where the police stood in front of the protesters' group with the dog.
In the second video, another police officer said, \"I'm gonna kill you all... animals.\"
Ferrell remembers how he struck himself with thought: “It’s unusual.
“It’s not the murder of this kind of murder that we’re used to and what we could call typical.”
I felt the nightmares at the moment.
I was angry and crying.
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
When he landed at 23 p.m., he went to his father after his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning two of Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary, “Whose Streets,” “Who’s streets?” which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and stamina from the perspective of those who live in this community and who fulfilled the answers in demand of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a flower dress on her back and had a good crown on it - went to Ferguson, they talked again about the subject that had come to them several times before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of the black people.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights,” he recalls.
“We’re going to fly the Ferguson because the police killed the 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t take him,” Ferrell said later.
“What’s happening now is... the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activistism and organization and also feel different layers of black people’s experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he does not experience personalised racism, he does not differ from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a bear if I protected him from this world.
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florida's way - a police station across the road, which had received a certain kind of campground where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped to share them with the protesters.
Ferrell slowly began to take the shape of a new type of activity.
“My activity changed completely after 9 August,” he said, stating that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minorities Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black and white communities.
“I had no organization experience.
It all just faded...
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with a film director Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said he and his film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell asked: “Do you try to document or find a story that can be used?
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white people - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: “We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do so differently.
Folayan had already hit hands with co-responsor Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for activeism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive for Frerelli and another six locals, followed by the film “Whose Streets” team after the shooting of Brown for years.
“No one speaks for us or for us in this documentary, but we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because it was also me.
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - the will to show that the movement was not “the pilot’s leader, but the assembly of the community,” as Folayan said, became the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Whose Streets” describes the surprisingly personal aspects of Frerelli’s life, such as falling in love and getting married to his wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he was ready to see the linen.
“But I realized that the humanisation of this work and of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.
Moreover, Ferrell’s story highlights and re-establishs the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Live Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators who thought in social media in 2012 after the murder of the Black Teen Trayvon Martin, #BlackLivesMatter, are homosexual.
“In its role, black homosexual women have generally maintained movement,” Ferrell said, “and precisely because we have to constantly fight on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.
Folayan agreed, stating that “the movement really holds black women alive, and many of them are black homosexual women.”
At the same time, he argues that “this is not a type of thing to create equal opportunities,” Ferrelli did not choose as the center of the film because of his identity.
“He was a man whose energy was right,” he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that he was directly located on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman in such nodes is much at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.
At the same time, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
In the course of the demonstration to Ferrell, the term of punishment for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the region he calls home, simply “the \"storage of the house\".
However, he still considers the important mantra that he has eaten in the memory since he went on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
7 tips on how to get over the Northeast party after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest men find after the day-to-day party that trouble, that help.
Or follow the statement, \"The shadow of the bourgeois, the constant drunk.\"
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent urge to health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend trailer - or any other party - feel better and get over from the top as painful as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Because the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
With water, mineral substances are also flushed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after the injection, it is especially good if it is free of bubbles or only slightly gasted.
Go walk.
It would certainly not cost Pohme to go with his grandmother to break the trees - it could prove fatal to be a false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Laming in bricks and dehumidifying the North is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're doing something wrong with last night, it's definitely not worth trying to load a high-fat fry.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars in your body to quietly market.
If the health of the lunch is already suffering, you could try a broth, for example.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don’t bet on pain-restraints.
If you take a pain reliever in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
So you're ruining your liver even more, and in the future it's worse.
In addition, the pain disorder does not persist in the body for a long time.
If you take a pain reliever in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it'll irritate you with a dirty stomach.
If you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It affects about the same way walking, but walking can’t get orgasms.
But avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during the pommel period, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Make a stupid talk with your friends, make simple fools, and laugh friendly about yourself and others.
A joke and a laugh may not take off the clowns, but it will certainly be more fun for them to bear the consequences.
It's going over once in a while!
Northwestern professor and employee of Oxford University are sought as suspects in murder
According to the police, Northwestern University's professor and Oxford University staff are being searched nationwide for, who have become suspects after the discovery of a male male man's dead body from a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to the case documents of the Cook County, the arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday without a bail-off by the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleu.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after a repeated coup.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police got a phone call and found a victim in front of Grand Plaza's apartment house.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleu was admitted dead at the scene and the investigators were involved in the killing while the police actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The Vice-President of the University of Public Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem is now temporarily withdrawn from work and is forbidden to enter the cities of Northwestern University.
“This is now the case with the criminal case of the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with the investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an old massist at Oxford University's financial department.
A representative of the University and the College of Somerville said in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the United Kingdom police and ready to assist U.S. research institutions in every way possible.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself out.
The head of the Chicago Police Department Communications Department, Anthony Guglielel, strongly advises the authorities.
“The parties have a sense of where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to define the exact location,” Gugliel said.
According to Gugliel, suspects are helping to look for both local, regional and national authorities.
Gugliel said the police received a call from the head of the Grand Plaza apartment house, who had just received a crypt hint that the apartment number 1008 had happened.
According to police reports, it was a magical sight.
It is not clear whether the event itself happened on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielel added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the residents: “The parties are currently working with the explanation of the background of events and the background of the victim, and explores the various motives, including the possibility that it was a family member.
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective,” said Madison Reed, a company selling hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside people.
A new type of human resource-based start-ups are key to helping companies figure out what their employees feel.
In developing and licenseing software, which is designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to make sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow linguistics to go through C-level managers and contact the board directly.
“There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company, Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software analytics tools are used to measure employee involvement.
He has received a much better view of what his employees think and feel in three years when he has used Glint.
In addition to the surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a company's heat card, which provides an overview of the most complaints in the departments and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they must remain aware of their working culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been rebelled into scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the harassing environment, where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance may be more than $11.7 billion according to the data of the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments by 2020.
Denver’s Colorado-based start-up company Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, noticed interest and increased activity in the background of Uber’s suspicious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and view heat maps from problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the CEO is concerned, the complaints will go directly to the board.
“The government’s opinion has been annexed by the regulatory authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if the company is found to treat its employees badly or behave inevitably, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and cases, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure the employee’s awareness of the rules and operations and to provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters.
If the employee previously wanted to report the problem, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, submit an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a depressing and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general adviser Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track workers' complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, however, there are problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached the leaders who acted in offices in other cities or states, more quickly to identify and deal with them.
“I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who runs the risk management team for Ruby Tuesday.
“And we will protect our participants from litigation with our employees.
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, or after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in connection with Enron's scandal due to ethical violations.
But only when “social media became mature,” the companies realized that they could not prevent their black wash from being washed publicly online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent funded $10 million companies such as Sappshire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to a value of $47 million.
In November, Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total fund to $60 million.
Such investments will not be a surprise to take into account the relationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
There are always more studies that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the Department of General Benefits and Workers’ Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if their portfolio companies are doing well; businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytical tools allow to increase employee engagement and involvement, then it is no wonder that they can be found.
Personal data on employee involvement is important, according to the experts in the working culture.
However, these data are useless if the company’s supervisors don’t do anything with them.
In fact, if the company asks its employees for feedback, it may create expectations that the changes will be expected.
And if changes do not happen quickly or at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said President Russell Raath of the Kotter International Business Administration, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“If things don’t end, then the employees will think: ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?
Madison Reed has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after making decisions and receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed in the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and hopes that in the long run, it will contribute to the long-term commitment of employees to the industry, known for its high-power flow.
“If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies –
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on Baltics, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a European Central Bank report.
According to the central bank, since 1999, total economic output per person in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success is low debt burden, fast improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
“Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where the purchasing power of real-GDP per person has been significantly closer to the EU average,” the central bank said.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total production of the economy per capita is equal to the richest Western Europe, in 2015, the total production of the Baltic economy represented only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better pay from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer study, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents appreciated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of the surveyed.
The NCAA decision to cancel twice a day will make the Bruins days long
It's almost 23 a.m. when the trobik UCLA footballers stop talking on the edge of a new training field in the team campus.
Some of them have peeled a shirt from their back, revealing the sweats of the first day of their training camp.
For most of the team, these power-emitters offer a break from noon.
In summer courses, players will go back to the final exams of the joint stage after three hours before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre in the next morning.
“The next three days are a real challenge for them,” said Chief Jim Mora of Bruins a little before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the gamers’ loads twice a day has actually made their days longer - at least until they get one-half of the final exams on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three workouts were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit players in a tight schedule.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week in advance compared to the previous season, and for the first time in the course of the six Westwood season, the training takes place during summer courses.
They will have 18 trainings until 20 August before the official preparation of the opening game for Texas A&M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another item on the agenda to the player’s tight charts.
“They have a huge load on three or four days and it’s a serious challenge,” Mora said.
“And they will break through this trial; they will try, they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.
When the camp is over, UCLA exercises are closed, which, however, is not an easy task, taking into account a clear view of the nearby parking site and the adjacent Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by football from the gate-post defense network.
Since this weekend, the gamers of the hotel Bruins, but Mora admitted that there might be problems with free rooms for a season.
\"We're building security measures,\" Mora said.
“This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to believe that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of training, it can make a pretty good deal.
But we're going to use the security team there and the 8th parking lot.
We do our best to make the best use of ourselves.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place.
The Electoral Union of Savisaare-Ivanova born to the Central Party, Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE are forced to leave the Reform Party to join forces of Maria Kaljuste, which have been set up for the merger of our Tallinn and the Party to show a creative trade union of businessmen in Tegus Tallinn - seems to be at least as much as political parties in the local elections this year.
The chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether there are enough disappointed voters for all.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If a small group of supporters of Edgar Savisaare has diminished, the event organised in honor of his electoral union may be unsatisfied.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current Central Party and many unknown faces – is this the composition of the electoral union?
And is there a reason why some of Savisaare’s faithful followers and friends are out of office in Tallinn, looking for a list of fans of the Savisaare, which are suspected of corruption and corruption crimes?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city hall for the Russian pop song, which is attended by the elder in Lasnamäe; and in every sense, the original computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the holidays and squirrels that have fallen on the road – is this how the Central Party will try the vote of the 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to go to the electoral boxes for the first time?
We look forward to other parties’ perception of the youthful election campaign.
If the Kanal 2 or TV3 viewers look at the black box instead of the beginning of August, there will be two options: agree to see in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or to give up tens of tens of them each month.
There are probably also those who initially rejoice in advertising free TV experience, but ultimately, although reluctantly, pay for television and advertising.
The music, the noisy people and the junk left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be part of the noise yourself, it’s best to go home and find out the country instead of the pain of your head - and leave the place to the festival.
Washington's Green Card Rules
The media releases are quoted by President Donald Trump, who says a new US immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money, as it changes how green cards are issued to citizens of other countries of the United States.
The law reduces chain migration and starts replacing the current program.
The new application process provides an advantage to candidates who speak English and have financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy,” Trump said, according to media publications in the United States.
The young people of Siberia move to the city, the pensioners return to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous gold miners along the Mana River.
He works 140 kilometres from home to the extra river of Mana, near the Show, as a car driver in a gold cartel.
It’s tough work: two months in a row without holiday days for 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and again.
In the three years worked at the Artelli, Anatol has only seen gold once.
“It’s a hard time: when you go in, you’ll be thoroughly checked that the wine doesn’t bring, and when you go out, you don’t take the gold,” Anatol says.
Mare Piho was talking to the local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian setos begins to affect the home-sets, because it is simply so stunning, thinks the most thoroughly distant set has been studied by Piho Mare.
His first visit to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many of them did they go out to Siberia in the late 19th century and early 20th century to get land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8000.
I took it out of Siberian seto's men's stories, who have thought about it themselves.
It’s hard to say, because at that time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was only given to the man.
The passport was given only one, but there were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historic Setomaa.
It was necessary to train, manage it in some way.
Set came here as peasants, but their life changed, because here they came into areas that were not only linked to agriculture, but also to the river (breathing), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peter, many of the sessions later went to work in a classified city of Krasnojärsk-45 (in this way, the Soviet power was built by the uranium plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sessions then form the majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and having a lot of children was preserved.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much was the culture of Siberian setos and different from that of the motherlands?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought a lot of crowds.
They did it themselves, but they always made a difference that was brought along and that was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of setos, as it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setoma, meat was salted, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian setode, and what life is there to live in? / graphics: Alari Paluots
Side with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that it is now going to give back to Setuma, and it will affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
Pho refers to the people of the Estonian seto delegation who came to the day of the Kingdom of Haida in July and lived four days in homes - J. P.
What's still here is amazing.
“It is very easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railway hub and the road crossing point,” says Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer a mere military town, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture places, and pizza can be found at every corner.
It's a top-end city!
There are small islands running through the city, where the killers tend to hold a Japanese party.
“This beautiful place does not look like a train window,” Reigo says.
Who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
In the river of the river, you can keep a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think ahead and behind.
I've been walking with my brides too.
The Operisian Tamm has been on the river bank since three bridges to practice his own treasure: “This place is on the side of the city, no one may be able to resist when his own stories come to an end.
“The hill opens a wonderful view of Tapale, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, the discolf play – golf course is done, chains can be borrowed from the sports centre,” Reigo says.
The old pros go there, of course, with their chains, but I haven't come to play there yet.
I guess I need to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull Tape to visit, because he has experienced a disco player and has chains.
Maybe he'll lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were indisputable in the present period of the operasolist childhood.
Less during the mouths.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you will win my sports life.
Not to mention broken coils and kisses.
“The city centre is now full of construction works, everything becomes unknown,” Reigo says.
However, the old and tired vasal building is a very attractive place to play summer performances.
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.M.M.M.M.M.M.M.M. took my idea and came to make a full summer theatre with my theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season, with Aleksei Karenin, was just over, on August 11, there’s a train station, “Resurrection,” when the old hospital building is moving around in the 1980s.
“Until 11-13 August, the days of the city of Tapa, which have been awakened by the open home cafés of the vassal building, and there are a series of cultural events, including the folk rally, are spoken by Reigo, who recommends to visit the 91-year-old city in those days.
In a small yellow house on May 1st, the museum has been in 1994.
“The house is small, but the exhibit is very much and the information is enormously appreciated by Reigo, which is filled with the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railway and military.
Reigo says that when Tapal passes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good dining places and sometimes feel like you’re abroad when sitting in cafes,” she explains.
Trained and young Tape soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs cafes, so when sitting there, it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but around the world is such an international company.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
TV bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal execution in Greece.
On August 1, the police arrested the illegal executioners of the Sithonia Peninsula group, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is now taking place.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already putting in place terrible traumas for anyone who is intertwined with rest in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to break sheep.
After the year, the farmers of Hiiumaaa must return to wolves from their herd “training material,” probably the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in the province of Hiiu have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep, and eight have been injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three, a year earlier 124.
There are also data from the Environmental Agency that the soil of the Hiiumaal wolves were not born and the data of the Hiiumaaa hunting council that this year is fixed to two wolves on the island.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village of Emmaste, and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, wolves broke a sheep in the village of Reheselja and injured the other one who had to be killed.
Genetically modified crop management rules must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft amendment to the genetically modified organisms Environment Act (GMOVS) and to the plant protection law.
The amendment to the Act will give up the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) sites and operators, in order to continue to use the plant health register.
In addition, the obligation of the GM farmer to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping at the specified radius is amended.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we need clear rules for the composition of genetically modified and unaltered crops.
This is at least until it is decided to declare Estonian GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, director of the Department of Plant Health at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
\"It must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors,\" Suu added.
The draft regulation repeals the provisions relating to the collection and management training of sites and operators in GM crops in the GMOVS, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the opening of economic activities.
In particular, in connection with beekeeping, the farmer of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to inform bees of the start of cultivation of GM crops by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the information system of the drafts and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
Planned changes will affect, in particular, persons operating in the field of plant cultivation, bees and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
Until now, however, no Estonian farmer is interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no corn cane in Estonia, a European variete that is resistant to maize MON 810.
The varieties of this cornline have also been developed for southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible GM organisms in the seeds of different suvirapists, corn and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The analysis of the samples carried out showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia, genetically modified crops are not consciously grown and that there was no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of \"genius\"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of \"geneity\", after the middle player, Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
For 40 million pounds, the player purchased from Chelsea began in the last pre-season game in Dublin before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday in the beginning of the 2-1 win-win original match while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on assault.
However, after leaving Blues’ pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in need of a mascara form and only lasted 45 minutes. Mourinho said it must improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“She needs time, but she has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking – she has a football mood,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible.
As Mattic, at the Aviva Stadium, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romel Lukaku began in the original line, and Mourinho began to quietly set up one of his first men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still want to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a \"great job\" by concluding agreements with three of its four priority choices.
“I’m grateful to the club for being able to realize three out of four,” he added.
“I’m even happier when they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
The second retailer was sent to the foot on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Matti Martinson, the Sõrves, the first curated son of a young birder, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined a large overnight collection of Mulluttu-Surlah.
This is because Sõrves is not a crop field, says Saarte Hääl.
On this Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the cucumbers, and another deaf boy got to the sender, and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project that is being carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
The bubble was supplied with a cucumber son named Matti GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türky.
“His work is on the Internet everyone looks at: how he went to the winter in Spain, came back to the house of the German and Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
The British inventor had to install a microchip in his own body to get to the house and car with a handle.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to whom the microchip was installed so that he could open his front with just a handle, get into the office and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had to install a tiny chip between his thumb and name finger, and now offers this service through BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their life easier with technology.
He has joined the forces of the Royal Hospital of Hampshire, Hants, in Winchester, with Dr. Geoff Watson to ensure that the installation procedure complies with the medical standards.
Technology is similar to the microchip for cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam’s company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to fit in with a chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child’s father has now installed technology in both his home and his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the military documents published by TIME, the White House’s decision to fly a helicopter of the navy last month for an American production event was to pay $24,000 to taxpayers outside the South.
The green and white color Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the President's engagement, was the central attraction of the American construction program in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and High White House officials renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with the hunting from Maine, the fire truck from Wisconsin and the biking aid made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for helicopter operation, the White House Military Cabinet required the helicopter's presence to be part of the order, or FARGO a day, 36 hours before the helicopter's \"unconventional\" landed on the southern court.
“I knew you would be aware of this, because it is unusually a matter of great attention to the event,” HMX-1 commander said a day before the event in an e-mail to his boss, Deputy Commander of the Navy in the field of aviation.
It was said that the helicopter will arrive at the South Square on 17 July at 7 a.m. and stay there until the yard is clean between 18 a.m. and 21 a.m. on the same night.
It was added that if leaving the White House it would be necessary for a return flight to the second workshop due to the limitations of working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the escort security team remained near the aircraft for the entire time it was on the ground.
It was not possible to find out whether or not the other echipaas were finally needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
“We asked if it would violate Hatchi’s law, and we were told not to break it,” the commander wrote.
“It seems like you don’t have a choice,” he said.
The White House declared the event – made in America – as an official event, and the Hatchi law would not cover it.
But even the official events have political altons.
At that time, the president supported the efforts of the health reform at the Senate and welcomed the efforts of the government to keep the regulations.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for a politically profitable purpose is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo scene is unusual.
Trump came to attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, was running the background of a president's plane, and his Twitter account is stacked with messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the release of “made in America,” where products were represented from all 50 states, manufactured by American workers from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, the White House spokesman.
The HMX-1 teams often do a test flight around Washington and south-west to train the U.S. President White House with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 White House organized 58 testing landings.
According to the official, the flight to the event, made in America, was considered to be the standard for the flight crew to the month of study.
In addition to that day, Esacader helicopters flew for 11 hours for non-preciated support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event carried the taxpayers' wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the helicopter’s exhibiting on the south side of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents for the President’s flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The Esacator's documents indicated the length of the flight from its base to the Navy Quantico airport in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much below that amount.
“The calculation of the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
‘These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and much other irreversible costs, which shall be taken into account for annual appropriations.
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House spokesperson Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at that time.
“The point is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So of course, it is right to highlight it.
It's not clear if Trump was in touch with a helicopter on the south side of the street or not, but he sat behind the role of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to the representatives, causing media publications to joke about the company’s products in his personal aircraft park.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three products.”
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m ran in the leg crash, and was taken out of the stadium with a knife.
Shortly before that, he had received a distance leap of zero on the Chinese Universe.
In 2012, the Helsinki EM was in breach of the low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he was in place at 6013 points.
However, the misconception continued.
After the opening day, the Moscow MM in 2013 had been in Estonia’s record schedule as a Estonian distance jumper.
Two years later, he became a 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic Standard, but it had also been a disappointment to the athlete.
The most difficult kadalipu only passed through the soil of Šadeko, unless at the beginning of Amsterdam’s EM was able to record the result of the distance leap.
I'd just like to put together a good multi-player competition once or once.
Once upon a time, Šadeiko sprayed.
The worst was ahead of him: a month later, his Olympic race in Rio was cut off because of the reef.
Is it time to take off – should we continue with the 7th race?
Is two days' effort worth it?
She thought long, but found peace in herself.
I thought my head was clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
“I knew that the pill was not going to put me in the bag yet,” said Šadeko about her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and move on with a new one.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to look at the sufferings of care, but he realized that the athlete must first of all be clear.
He was so matered by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
“Grit said he wouldn’t give up and he wants to prove to himself what he deserves,” Mägi said.
There's some kind of peace in him now.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
The contest came back in May, when Šadeiko erected the 6280 points of the new Estonian record at the Götz multiplayer.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark with nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a record-to-time obstacle.
Then the multi-player felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but was simply a first-time competition.
He has been a teacher for years and says that Šadeiko is a master student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
If something happens or is wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his sense.
That's what we have to go about.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Šadeko.
“I’m not the one who does the highest in training,” he says, saying, “the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.

One alcohol whose drinking is equal to brain-treading.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is a big wine fan that believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and minds, but rather “very active” in the process of tasteing wine.
By snoring the glass, in the mouth of the wine, while enjoying it and after-sales, we put our brains into work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain “sees” colors.
“The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine,” Sheperd says.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, says that wine is not enough to drink.
“There must be more,” he says.
If you take too big, the system is overstretched.
An excessive wine drink can harm the brain rather than the benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental ability.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The UN Head of Mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play their role.
The United Nations Head of Assistance, Nicholas Haysom, said hundreds of women are candidates for local Soviet elections, three women are candidates for Vice-Presidents and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
“With the emphasis on the role of women, it is not possible to overdo it,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened by its part the electoral process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
The elections of this year will be celebrated for the first time when power will be quietly transferred from one democratic elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, women have a strong role to play in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan independent electoral committee, 1.2 million women are registered from 3.6 million voters.

From the Philippines to a wide world, or Ollgkot trip to the heart of the Moefänns
Bags that have been bloated from shoulders are summer classics, which have become their own hit product in recent years, which on one of the right souvenirs, has to hang at the end of the hand, and have been able to attract the price bridge according to the hit, despite its modest origin.
The bag that has been bloated from the shoulders is probably one of the things that has existed in life every single time, and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
But now the shoulder bags are making a real race and the fashionmen have changed their fine designer bags for summer months to simple-headed bags.
At the same time, it is not just a beach bag, but it is so popular as a street bag and the bravest women even walk into the office.
It is important, however, to make it clear, before that, whether a summer hole like this is still sitting on the boss, or it is worth the wet and the laptop, however, to put it in a slightly more formal fog.
However, the misconception has made the women’s true love for the women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to do is to see that the Moegurmans are the first thing in the holiday trip to the local market, and to buy a pair of shoulder bags to be faithful throughout the holiday season, and that goes along the beach, on the market and on the city with friends.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that there is a demand among the readers so large that women (and men) in the real world may go hand in hand to each other to become a happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, such a madman is also understood, because few are the times when some of the things that have risen in the fashion world can be bought for just a few euros.
True, planners have also discovered a simple money service option here, and so the finer luxury brands sell beer bags for some time and thousands of euros.
Obviously, the richer customers shouldn’t feel like the simplest ones who promenade around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros-paying handbags.
The interpretation of Chanel’s ilgkot may however take place around 6000 euros.
Unlike most fashionables, the shoulder bags are not derived from some great fashion, but they began far from the beginning.
They come from the Philippines, where they have been carried without it.
There is a lot of time when there’s an exorcism and locals around them.
It's supposed to be from the 14th century, and it's pretty sad with a normal wrinkle.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be as hard as a basket, they can be clogged by patterns and other materials that make the house more personalized and thus more attractive.
For example, in recent times, there are especially trendy bags with colored beads or leather strips.
The letter of thanks may, however, be sent to actress Jane Birkin, who had not been seen before.
He used to fit in the shoulder bag with all sorts of clothes, and he didn’t even have to go to Cannes’s movie festival.
At the popularity of bags today, however, there is no less role to play in caring for them, and unlike all other Sumadans, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but the matter also drives water and wet towels.
As in the case of trend cuts, apart from classic appearance, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want, you can buy a ribbed from your shoulders or a small shoulder.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes from the present, but from the shoulder.
But what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of such shoulders, which resembles a basket from its style, has been considered classic and is open and short, as well as shoulders, sands.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The company expects the cookie manufacturer McVitie's leaders to confirm the long-term production plans at the Glasgow company.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future investment of Tollcross.
The factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products works for more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
The employees were hired, and the presidents of the trade union, “are the first to hear,” when something changes in the factory’s activities.
In a letter sent to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland turned to McVitie’s company, asking, “Restriction concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t explain to the head of the object about Tollcross’s business needs and the future investment plan is deeply concerned by our members.
Here, several generations of families have worked, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, as a necessary support for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social weather waste.
As a result, Glasgow needs the eastern part of jobs, wages and well-being, and Brexit, the increase in living costs and the chronic decline in production, with a hard-growing return on McVitie's –
The representative of the Pladis said: “The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are currently reviewing our activities - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds of Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as the heritage of the production object, and if there should be any change in the operation of the object, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in his efforts to attract Neymar into his ranks, making him buy 189 million pounds of offer. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest trip?
This gross approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the world record of the overthrow, which was erected last season by the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymarist will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will get paid by over 500 000 pounds per week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry because of the approach and the free break in Neymar, although the close source of Catalans confirms that the club has always been the best care for its footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaf strongly warned all clubs who think about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch some of our players, we’ll take a stand against them and contact their players,” Al-Khelif said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to conclude a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have taken over this border, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the central player Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could receive a feedback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
“Brexit is seriously threatening to hit the race between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland,” Varadkar warned Northern Ireland on his first visit after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to move the current people and goods free, said Varadkar.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he said.
According to Varadkari, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and since it is not capable of being part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s exit smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Knowing that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We may have such an agreement with the United Kingdom.
Alternatively, it would be a return to customs points that would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
“Though trade, prosperity and peace,” the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit the challenge of our generation, and warned that this result could affect every aspect of North Ireland’s everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Mart Avand, the first half of his triathlon, is able to pass through Ironman.
The largest Triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital of Otepül, when half-pika Ironman’s competition hall was located about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, he also finished his first triathlon in his life.
“I thought it would be difficult, and finally it was difficult,” Avandi said.
Despite the complexity, Avandi said that in fact, triathlon is a strong head for everyone.
“The distance does not kill, but the pace kills,” he said, suggesting that every head of the finish reaches the finish.
Except there Sepp: “Ot’s body is all right, but he can’t swim.”
The key had been working since February.
At first, 4-5 hours a week, but later ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached 270th place in the general account.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Rajoja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called “prominists” races.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The overall winner of the Otepää stage men’s accounting was crowned by the German John Moldan at 3:58:27, and the Estonians were the best Ivo in the great time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, Helle Fredericks won 04:24:01, but of the Estonians, Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederism almost half an hour and received 04:58.
The key passed a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410 positions.
