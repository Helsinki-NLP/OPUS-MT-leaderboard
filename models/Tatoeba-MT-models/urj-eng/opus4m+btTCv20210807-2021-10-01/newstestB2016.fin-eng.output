A nine-year-old boy in Tampere was found
Police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip in Tampere on Tuesday night.
Loss notice of a son who left West Tampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police situation center, the boy has been contacted and he has no life and health risk.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanonom about half-night knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the post-conflicts.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a hurricane - tearing the goal difference in Messin
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league on the weekend and continued his factory on the Champions League.
The competition between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Masters turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo was alone at the top of all time's painting statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits on the penalty and one on the gaming situation.
Ronaldo raised his title balance to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the league of the Masters, it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning painting made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of a knee-flying Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's election game, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second club, United, also experienced a hard experience in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered 1-2 drops.
The 20-year-old assistant Luke Shaw's visit to ManU only took a watch.
The dangerous-looking sliding resistance of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target of the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely broken into the leg.
Shaw slept with Eindhoven's home stadium lawn for ten minutes before the medical staff left to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests 41 minutes to 1-0, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno fixed before the break with an extra time.
In the second half, Luciano Narsingh made the winning painting of the PSV.
In the league of the Masters of the Painting season, Part A began in Paris Saint-Germain.
Manchester United's shirt's PSG had changed from Argentina to Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball to the back corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been drawn to the successers of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is part of the length of the league, is not the best possible comparison.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TssSKA lost the B Block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition Party immediately called for a difference - the president said the wrong speech
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had held a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again held the same speech in Parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not realize that the speech was the same during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full-life power.
The MDC called for Mugabe to resign because it is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants were rushing to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s presidium and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will assess the request.
According to German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe will be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers include Merkel on the table of Interior Ministers.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University, asked a voice on the emergency call to his home and told him that he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was present and probably alive and afraid. The professor told us that the contact details of the deceased woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, the police found a message written to Amy Prentis' body and white paper: “I’m very sorry, and I hope I can cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me, in a letter signed by Lamb, read according to the authorities.
In the house there were no signs that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. The police found his campus at the door of his workroom, the professor of the dead history, Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to have shot at Lamb.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the University's officials were given information about shooting at 10.18 a.m.
She said that Lamb called a fatal emergency a while later.
In the day, there was another death incident, and Lamb took away the spirit when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teaching staff remained behind the doors locked, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers examined the details in both locations, and the Lamb knew taught about the man. The researchers were born with a picture of a talented but perhaps a problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor’s classes.
According to Gautier Police, the Prentis death scene, the professor had no previous record of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in a book written by Lamb, which had given recognition to “humans,” with whom he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 people in the teaching staff. Many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
She said that the professor, Brandon Beavers, felt excited and nervous, “as if he had something wrong.
The second student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about the stress he suffered from the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's remuneration policy meant that the argument that Lamb had worked hard on would not automatically guarantee him the assistant professor's office.
William LaForge, director of the University, said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that Lamb was suffering clearly from something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After he left the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken away his life with a 38-calibre gun in the back yard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a half a mile from his parents' home, said Methel Johnson, a Washington County killer.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed that the man knew the inhabitants of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began his work as a geography and educational teacher at a university with 3,500 students. In the city there were 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got a doctorate in the spring.
One of Lamb's most long-term friends described this as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he met with Lamb's friends when he was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old.
She was still a friend in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar for years.
She was a very heartbroken at the time.
All the girls were on her doctor, said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentis had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but according to no document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the small town of Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
The former husband, Shawn O'Steen, said he had resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
“He was very upset,” O’Steen said.
“Tytari and Mom were the best friends.
O'Steen had not met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentis met when Lamb and Abigail appeared in both summer events three years ago.
Later, they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is writing and presenting her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barmaid and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Jules Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentis on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick for a rare audience.
Nothing said something was wrong.
\"A happy couple,\" Shaffer said.
\"We talked together.
Both had a good sense of humor.
“The first year of his career was directed by Professor Schmidt and specializes in the history of Indians and colonial times,” said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married, and he had three small children.
He studied at the Empire State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own fraternity and college.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a memorial ceremony in the candlelight, and there were teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night’s event, where the university choir performed songs “Bright Morning Star” and “Amazing Grace”
The study continues on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get students back,” LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to the Mississippi Cleveland.
Suppliers: Associated Press Suppliers at Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are telling me that Lamb called after the shooting of Schmidt. In addition, it was specified that, although Lamb referred to the emergency call as his wife in Prentis, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us wants to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to employ as much seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is providing his current employees and seasonal workers with the opportunity for additional work hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Applicants’ interviews will begin this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months in the holiday period, the trade season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary labour to stores and to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his \"treffie\" with Princess Diana
The first night of the future film was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox’s career.
First night also had a personal significance.
“We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royals. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I was told that Princess Diana was coming to my side,” Fox told the next Back in Time in the trailer.
“When the film began, I realized that the situation was very much like dating the Princess of Wales.
The Back in Time document is related to the Future of Return films, and it also interviews Fox in addition to Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Return to the future film received its first night 30 years ago.
“This film is definitely a time travel film for me,” Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and presented in selected cinemas from October.
Secretary-General of the United Nations: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia’s enhanced military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that the weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again invited all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Banan announced his intention to meet five permanent member states of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France, to discuss the situation in Syria. The meeting would be scheduled later in the context of the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly.
Ban complained that the decentralisation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
Ban called for five permanent member states to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the Syrian crisis that reached the Iranian nuclear treaty.
8 figures of suffering: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried to be an empty cleaner.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican Circles have tried to draw Trump down from the Gallup leadership.
Ten of the eleven national gallupes show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously reflecting what it says in practice about the options of the real estate mogul.
Elections are only in the early stages.
No one has been announced that Trump is elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who had been in a galaxy in 2011, was able to give room to ascending Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would be difficult in the general election.
External groupings, such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump’s strong position and started digging to cover his weight.
The following new galup data shows that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with an ophthalmic:
There has been a full translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, according to Monmouth University, only two out of ten Republicans were a positive picture of the real estate mural.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive idea.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52%.
Now six out of ten Republicans are a positive picture of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are linguistic.
These figures are also considered in the states where the elections are held first.
In the last week’s Quinni Market Gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
At CNN and ORC, 67% of Republicans said they were very happy or happy with Trump's choice as candidates last week.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson will make almost as keen a reception as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40% of Trump's nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding share of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush was elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump’s temperament problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for the volume and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the globe consider the property mogul’s features suitable for the President. The views are reflected in the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting will be held first: According to the Quinni market gallery, 52% of Republicans consider Trump’s personal features suitable for the chief of the Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively and six out of ten consider Trump’s temperaments inappropriate to the White House.
Republicans are starting to get used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When I ask Republicans who are most likely to be the candidate of the party, according to CNN and ORC, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since the mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money in check for Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in place before.
At this stage, four out of ten Republicans in the last election considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think the Trump campaign is convincing.
Although Republicans would support another candidate, Trump will cover almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that a shared camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University’s opinion poll revealed that in the imaginary double-trip between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would have a greater support on his side almost always.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's on levels.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win from Trump with 19 points apart from the imaginary twin fight.
A small majority of Trump's supporters have already made a vote.
According to a galup published on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, fair half of Trump’s supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation may change for many reasons, and currently a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump’s supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump’s great competitor at this moment is the neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates will vote twice more likely to Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans join Trump's view of the colony.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump, two months ago, migrants from Mexico have been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned about the fact that Trump’s volume-oriented speeches remove important Latin American voters from Republicans’ troops and hinder brand renewal.
According to ABC News and Washington Post polls published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as the transfer is in the light, there is Donald Trump.
Inconsistency with the administration is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans’ votes. The recommendation is significantly more than that both have come to terms outside.
The Republican forces want to be a new face instead of a political box, according to the latest poll by ABC News and Washington Post, this opinion was six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also painful for Washington.
According to Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the brink of rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Survey
After the election, Corbyn's first launch at the Prime Minister's poll is expected to be
Jeremy Corbyn, the new screenshot of Labour Party Labour, is supposed to rise for the first time to ignore his forces at David Cameron's poll.
Corby's first six questions after a little bit of a day, and media and representatives of the Labour Party follow a man's eye hard.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and adds facts to the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corby’s leadership will be weighed for the first time. Corby will be subjected to a parliamentary test now after the gathering of the shadow government and the speech held by the Central Association of the Corbyn Trade Unions at the TEC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to pause during the National Song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War in Tuesday has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party. The Vatiolo has also ended up in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national song raised attention
Corbyn, a representative of Corbyn, said that Corbyn was standing during the national song, respecting in silence the heroes of the Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn Shadow Government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the party's leader to join a national song despite the opposition of this monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first-aiders by appealing to differences in economic, defence and external affairs. Less than six parties initially supported the choice of Corbyn to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant considers that political differences between Britain's EU membership and government's tightening conditions for granting benefits have collapsed in the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour intends to propose changes to eliminate the restrictions altogether.
A few hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions Smith said that the position of the party was very clear: it only opposes government plans to reduce the limit from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth leader of Labour, whom David Cameron will face in the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new policy-authorised Labour leader says that he has chosen questions to be presented to Cameron from the public on 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, Islington North’s election, the poll has too many confrontations, and he promises to avoid nostalgic vocabulary and license emissions, and says he focuses on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has stated that the shadow minister Angela Eagle will be strangled with polls, for example, when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corbyn has also given the idea that others could also make a sound, and he tells us that he was discussing this issue with President John Bercowin of the House.
When Corbyn rose to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said he wanted a doll theater policy that was often linked to a survey hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in his pursuit.
Since the first time the survey hour was broadcast in 1990, it has been regarded as a central measure of the criticism, control and position of the director, but according to critics, the survey hour has become a cartoon who needs massive reforms.

Pound strengthens in Britain's wage rise
Punta confirmed the increase in wages in the UK, and SABMiller drew up the FTSE 100 index.
In May-July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year.
More rapid growth was fastest since 2009.
The price was increased by 1%, and the rate was quoted to $1,5505, and the price was also confirmed in relation to the euro, and was quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was reduced by 20% when the company received the initial purchase offer from the competing company AB InBev.
When it comes to the conclusion of the trade, the world's two largest brewery companies would combine and bring the brands under the same roof, such as the Buddha, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the competing Richemont Group’s positive results on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. The development of sales was also a result of the rise in Burberry’s key market in China.
Glencore’s share rose by 5% of the miners’ declared plans to raise $2.5 billion by the stock as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mond were the largest fall of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the company’s share prices for sales purposes.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to 46,6 million pounds.
JD Sports Pomo: higher wage spending could be detrimental to expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, President of the JD Sports Management Team, the increase in the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs can jeopardise the plans for the enlargement of JD Sports and reduce the need for additional labour force.
Metcash launches the grass root campaign against Ald's waist
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA store from Ald's conquest in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a wholesaler in food, has launched a grass root campaign to preserve the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Aldin’s $700 million invasion of Australia.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands with mainstream communications and social media and organise events like Adelaide-show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory in Dunsborough, Simmo offers delicious IGA stores, and traders sell ticket tickets to our customers at a discount price for South Australia football league games.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade team organises an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, as South and West Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA sales footprint, and in these areas the roofing is greater than in the IGA trade network of the Eastern States.
Southern and Western consumers are known for their periphery, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in Western Australia 24%, while in the eastern states is only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sale of IGA traders could be 360 million and Metcash's sales would be $250 million by the end of 2016.
The prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will raise $500 million in these areas and $600 million in sales.
Metcash’s fixed costs are high, so loss of food sales and volley can mean a loss of $113 million in the result before interest rates and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in Eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s recent research shows that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group’s leading portfolio manager, Hamish Douglas, said at the event held in Melbourne, he considered it very likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that the member of the Board of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the results of Metcash’s food business, serving 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% from 2012 levels. The figures show a decrease in debt financing when the pressure is on sales and roofs.
However, the wholesaler takes countermeasures and makes an annual harvest of over $1150 million in Australia to meet Coles and Woolworth’s prices for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the renewal of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food mix of their brands.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice said that the price review and the sales reform plans are at a good pace, and the company will be able to again increase its profits in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, defends Thanasi from Cooking
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior rather than the criticism of a special painting.
According to Steve Healy, the president of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a victim of recent crime related to Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves a special title instead of criticism.
“The two younger parties, named “Special K-” Kokkinakis, were subjected to an unfavorable light shield when the evil son of Kyrgios provokes his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon thereafter, in the race between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge was forced to separate the competitors from each other. “Wawrinkan should have given back Kyrgious and my friend,” Harrison said.
In U.S. open Kokkinakis, he was frustrated in the field of the Mayan, when powerful cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the second-time single-player Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against the UK.
“I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn to his argument,” Healy said.
“He broke the field when he lost the game in the US open, and he’s not the first player to break his mail due to frustration. I know Thanas so well that he’s not proud.
However, he has been very good at the provocative use of Harrison in the US, for example, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for 19 years old, he works hard and complements a very team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected amongst players. He practices hard, is in good condition and a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated based on his own metrics.
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the important round of the Australian team. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties. However, he is in favour of returning the Canberra tumor to the team for long-term confirmation.
“First of all, we want to focus fully on the matches rather than on the problems associated with Kyrgios,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man must grow up in the light of the public. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace for him. I believe it is best for both the whole team and Nick.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared the emergency, closed its southern border from Serbian direction on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants, aimed at preventing the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of migrants collapsed on the non-kennel land, and the Serbian authorities react violently.
People fleeing from violence had to stay on the road to their tents for an indeterminate period of time between the control stations of the countries.
The decline began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter fly over the migrants, these hurdles, open the border, and shouted insults to Hungarian mercenaries.
Some became a protest for eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as further arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, a day later began when the 28-state groupings failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the arrival of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common; the meeting raised the hope that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extra summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the continental migration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in two southern regions the authorities could put in place more effective means, i.e. to close you and speed up the legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a pitching line to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that point of view, now that Serbia’s border is already ready for aid.
The CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners participated in the invitation to tender for the finalization of the hand-outs between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that the majority of incoming people are living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security, and the view is sharply different from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that came into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime that exceeds or harms four metres of crowns of silicon wire, which the government has built on the southern border in the direction of Serbia.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government announces a crisis situation in the country,” said the government reporter Zoltan Kovacs, reporters in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
We follow a strict line: illegal crossing is a crime.
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military measures that are expected next week. Suppliers of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border for several days with their vehicles and military dogs.
Gyorgy Bakkoni, an adviser for internal security in Orban, said that the authorities had caught 45 border crossings to try immediately at the border and 15 longer.
Helps by harming people across the border are now in possession of the police, and they are accused of crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing sites on the Serbian border on Tuesday.
Kaaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske in Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container at the point of contact where people packed in.
About 20 were in, but thousands were out.
The second migrant group is blocking the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary. People announced they were in the eating and drinking lake until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders, reduced to half according to national gallup
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support rate is still a two-digit race for the Democratic National Presidential Candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has exhausted the distance.
Clinton’s support is now 47% of the votes of the Democratic People’s People’s Party (with 58% reduction), while Sanders has a second 27% support (up to 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure for the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the pre-elections for the majority of Democrats, it is too early to tell who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton’s supporters are more confident about their choice of other candidates.
Following the galup last month by CBS News, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton’s suffering among men has fallen significantly, and he only has a 5% needle in front of Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership amongst Democrats under 50 years of age, and now he's at levels with Sanders.
Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton’s first trip to the favors of Sanders among the liberals was a two-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to announce their support for Clinton if he is elected as a candidate for the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would also be particularly eager to be a candidate if he was elected as a candidate.
There are more divisions among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
48% of Democrats would support Clinton. Only 35% of Republican voters would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s voters are freely asked to describe why they support their nominations, the most popular justification is Clinton’s true experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose a female president (13%) and third, the fact that Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, there is a mention of common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice President is still weighing on his possible nomination, and 57% of Democratic voters would like him to join the race, and the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When I ask the Democratic voters for the second most popular candidate as a party candidate, most of them choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular for Sanders.
If Biden does not go to the Democratic Candidate Competition, Hillary Clinton will grow his first trip to Sanders. Sanders will be involved with the promotion of 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not go to the race.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is far from Clinton, but more believe in Biden’s chances of winning the actual elections.
Democrat voters, however, consider the views on the issue to be more important in terms of the profits of candidates.
Voters do not regard any democratic candidates or potential candidates as unacceptable.
Voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia to be honest, reliable and managerial.
Biden is often described as honest, while Clinton is often regarded as a leader.
Up to 30% of Democrats consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, while Sanders is 15%. 27% cannot say whether Sanders is honest.
Democrat voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden’s views are close to voters’ own ideology.
There is no opinion of Sanders on all features.
When the voters are asked for views of Hillary Clinton's private email and the use of their own servers as a foreign minister, most of the Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed the perception of these voters from Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with Clinton’s report, and only a third of them are satisfied.
The views of the people were divided in March, when the conflict had just become public.
Most Americans believe that the use of controversial emails has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% says that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton honest and reliable, it is possible to improve these features by asking for the views of all voters: Clinton considers it honest and reliable only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than in the last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not regard Clinton as honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not regard Trump as honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Six of the candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be more reliable.
The majority consider Sanders honest, but as with Carson, many people have no Sanders opinion.
The survey sample is 351 voters, and the survey error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is catching Donald Trump's front trip to the National Suffering Survey
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates caught more than half of the votes in a new survey, and left other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support share has risen from 23% of the CBS survey, held before Fox News last month. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson’s support would be a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to a survey, Carson has strong support for all population groups, and in a highly trained group he is very much defeated by Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far away. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is weak and has fallen from 10% of last month to 2%.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida shared a third position with a support of 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican speakers is 6% in the direction or the second. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the latest survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson’s support is rising, and 19 percent of Republicans are worth it when Trump’s support is 32%.
ABC News and Washington Post’s latest survey, Trump, also led a clear lead ahead of Carson.
In the last week's encounter with men, Trump launched extraordinary charges for a retired neurosurgery, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday in his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the department charged with the death of Baruch College Fuks
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in a state ritual in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountain, five people are charged with murder charges.
Baruch College (City University of New York) The members of the Department of Pi Delta Ps were brutally assaulted by Chun-Michael-Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to a hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had been put in a box filled with almost 15 kilos of sand, and he had been repeatedly attacked by him trying to get to the place that was placed on the other side of the rigid field.
Deng is first told of his choice of headache and then lost consciousness.
Police said the P.D. Department of Pi Delta Ps did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they are supposed to have waited an hour before the deng was taken to the hospital.
Police chief Chris Wabner told the press conference that the members were able to change the clothes of Deng, googlate his symptoms and contact the chairman of the department Andy Mengi.
“At this stage, the members began to hide the tools, putting the department’s advantage ahead of Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
Deng was not recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the report, Deng had been beaten several times in the head, in the upper body and traveling on a boring object.
“Lia’s many families have been shocked by the fact that at least one student per year has died as a result of a simulation since 1970,” says Douglas Fierberg, a family lawyer representing the Deng family.
The members of the departments and their members must be held accountable where the authorities need to take an important step.
The great jury of the Monroe County presented five members of the department to blame for the third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with simulation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for the simulation officially or informally accepted organization,” Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed an operating ban on the department, and the national department resigned from the operations of the local department.
This will affect the increase in interest rates of the US Central Bank (Fedin)
The increase in interest rates and the increase in the stock market are acidified, the return of securities rises and the economy slips to the ground.
That's what we know.
We don’t know how long it takes and how long the effects last.
In particular, with regard to the economy, we find history to be an indication of timing.
She has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, not always. The determining factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but how long it takes to normalize the situation.
There are a number of variables involved.
At the end of the day, market operators may find that all interest rates may be excessive.
“The first increase in the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly interpreted as a sign of the end of bad money,” Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics Chief Global economist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalization of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, it does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples of how the impact can be seen in different areas of the economy:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, the interest rate rise can increase the instability for some time.
When the interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
“The trend would seem to be the stagnation of the interest rates on capital after the first increase for 12-24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy,” the Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study on the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
For the last 35 years, the market is generally seen at a sharp increase in interest rates, about 14%, fairly flat for the next 250 days (average 2.6%), after 500 days the situation normalizes, and the average interest rate after six share threats is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s Chief Equity Strategy Barron’s.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is usually slightly delayed in the late stages of the cycle and interest incomes are beginning to decrease.
Lama is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates tends to work on it in general.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that had not existed before and could accelerate the decline.
It is of particular importance that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of the increase in the central bank’s steering rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase of 118 steering rates since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, many did not think it would last, and in the third quarter it would be 1.5%, the regional central bank of Atlanta said.
In such a sensitive economic situation, the rise of interest can be a risk and can be asked if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market operators have been talking about the increase in the steering rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to the meeting of the Open Market Committee (Federal Market Committee) of this week, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves a withdrawal at this meeting, the future trade is only a 25% probability.
“In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles until now have been in a supercycle, which, even before the decline in GDP, will rise very quickly after the rise of the increase,” the report says.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst sheep in the vertical period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since last month, and the record had been 35 months, now is going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the former interest rate on the market, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
The difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return seems to change the direction as soon as the first rise/calculation cycle starts.
At the end of the increase cycle, the income is immediately reduced, Deutsche said.
Charles Schwabi’s strategicists believe that the subscription will allow long and short-term bonds to approach each other and level the curve.
“Collective bonds often work better in such a environment, even though we are still cautious about returns,” said Kathy Jones, an analyst in the flat-income securities of Schwab.
According to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future trend of the central bank.
“In addition to the consolidation of the Dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of the tightening of financial policy,” Jones said.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is direct, the credit risk margins are expanding and volatility increased. All are market-specific in a situation where the central bank tightens policy.
Widely speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit, as the interest rate is reduced and local products begin to attract.
The prospects of the debtor multinational companies are weaker, as the strengthening dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the debt rises.
“The doctor shows that quality shares are more productive in the next three months,” Goldman Sachs analysts told their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet were driven by low-balance-sheet companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rates by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility shares also improved their quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
“It’s a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally benefit from a dollar confirmation.
The savers also benefit from higher yields. The experts are, of course, different from how quickly the effects appear.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a Classic FM copy
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticises the radio station for excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitors.
It also claims the BBC Music Awards will only be a copy of the Brits Gaala.
The Voice channel is responsible for personal intolerance.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually turns into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations increase the pressure on the station to prove that each of the other commercial radio stations will be provided.
The Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leader that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populistic and the channel is no longer separate from its commercial competitor.
“I don’t want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to change in the direction of the Classic FM channel,” Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards held last December also receives criticism from Bingham:
“The BBC Music Awards held for the first time in the year will affect the British Awards’ copy.
These two are examples that instead of a new and different one, simply mimic what is already on the market,” Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 had a commercial competitor with significantly more live music and selective content.
“I learned from Radio 3 from classical music that I can’t learn from other channels.
The commitment of the channel to live music and music is entirely in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works,” the Director-General said.
Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3, said that the station had to work harder to maintain public interest, because Britishs know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only critical of entering the commercial channels in the consultation of the BBC channel, a limited cultural, media and sports committee.
The Tory Party Parliamentary Secretary Dame Collins criticised the Voice Performance Competition, which BBC purchased from Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at £22 million.
“It’s not much to talk about, because it’s not unique or particularly distinctive.
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which was starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way to the BBC.
In addition, Collins called on the company to search for a slow program of its own, when it next launched a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to exclude the continued order of the Voice series or the use of taxpayers’ money for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online commerce is the slowest in August of all time – perhaps the black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of online commerce have been statistical since 2000. In the last month, growth was the slowest of all time.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with mobile sales.
Experts believe that November’s black Friday can control purchases.
For more than ten years, the takeover of e-commerce has helped many of Britain’s shopping scandals.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is becoming more balanced, and new sales figures show only 7% growth over the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when online sales have been statistics since 2000. Last year, online sales grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is becoming more balanced, and new sales figures show only 7% growth over the first three months of 2015.
“If we compare the growth of the past year to the 2000 readings, it is clear that growth will be balanced over time,” IMG’s chief editor, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce was accelerating three years ago when consumers adopted mobile sales.
“With this, more and more were able to buy a net, and for many it was possible to buy it in a different environment, even with a home threat.
When mobile mobility is now more moderate, growth can be balanced.
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered as one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day to be spent on the last Friday of November can allow consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to the normal ones made many traders’ websites fall.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which allows consumers to push after offers, can control purchases during the rest of the day.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of purchased fashion shops.
The Mecca is buried for the victims of nostril accidents, Bin Laden's family responsible
Muslims carried 29 bodies on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia claims that Saudi Binlad Group is involved in an accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the withdrawal.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered together to bury 29 victims of a nostril falling on Mecca’s Grand Mosque
The streets had gathered among the white-dressed people to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
It was only a day before the mosque’s roof entered on the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia calls for Bin Laden’s family company to be responsible for an accident where 394 people were injured.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca's Great Laundry accident were transported on the streets.
Among the fallen dead of Nostur was Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca with his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents, who had started their annual career trip.
Saudi Arabia’s authorities have promised that the break-up will take place when thousands of people are coming to the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left up the boom of the crane when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, Binladin Group is a party to the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to the English-language information, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane in the yard of the Great Smoker. Thousands of Muslims are headed to the Great Smashie's break-down later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice of nostril accident, and the Group's representatives have not been targeted for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with the current safety regulations and cooperated with meteorological experts.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by Mekka’s Suurmoskeja as part of Binlad Group’s giant construction project.
Bin Laden’s family has had close links to Saudi Arabia’s reigning family for decades, and Bin Ladenit is responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s senior leader, Osama bin Laden, was a creative boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
A nostril accident occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage of Meka, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities committed to pay a million Rials (EUR 250 000) to the victims’ own and permanently injured.
The other injured persons receive half of the compensation amount.
According to the B&Q bomb, behind the phenomenon there is a cheap Eastern European workforce
The British hire the generals of the home more often, says Veronica Laury.
The recommendations have been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who are employed as professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for employees will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Editor, Daily Mail
The British are said to move home hammering and painting operations to the authors from Eastern Europe.
Ironing and painting skills seem to be rare today.
The British are now increasingly hiring home generals to manage home niccaring works, says B&Q’s CEO.
Veronica Laury is a new CEO in Kingfishher, who owns a home refurbished shopping chain. According to Laury, professional workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices are behind the phenomenon.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Srewfix stores for traders, while 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female cancer in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store make a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is important to take into account the demographic trends, as today, more and more single-living women are returning to their home.
“The staff of our sales are still mostly men,” Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the five women who are in the aftermath of companies in the British FTSE 100 index, and he has also reorganized the company’s management team so that the male and female leaders are balanced.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality of its staff, as 50% of its staff is women, including the CEO and the financial director.
“This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us,” Laury said.
“It hasn’t been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher’s half-year operating profit and sales figures have been down even though the company has worked hard after the sale.
Kingfisher is responsible for the current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-season government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee organisations began to force the same way, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that there is a sense.
Let's ask if it's worth a break when it's going bad.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already announced that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but go to work.
This would have been impossible in the old time of good consensus.
Of course, there was no net where to protest, but openly declaring as a wealth would have been a political suicide of a small person.
A million-member trade unions in a few tens of thousands of human protests do not slow down, but it gives the cause of thought.
The position of the trade union is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have been running on their own for years, they are finally allowed to defend, appear and properly.
The government may, therefore, want to capture the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary.
Let’s be honest about the organization’s actions, and it’s a mess that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has been stopping for a long time.
For example, industrial production has been down for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment rises.
I think these things would force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard savings: The objective of 8.5 million savings, the reduction of staff by 130
The University of Lappeenranta will start a savings fund with the aim of getting the cost paid by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings of the University, the entire staff-related yt negotiations, with a savings target of 6.5 million each year.
In practice, it means a reduction of around 130 employees.
Other activities will also save two million.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It also affects the budget cuts made by the government.
During this accounting period, the University will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the same funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other funding will be EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass education and research cuts and the reduction of corporate finance with our university is very significant, says Professor Anneli Pauli at the University’s press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts were even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland’s railway transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to open up to competition gradually.
The first is the direct traffic in the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
There is a long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The Central Bank of the United States
The whole world will be following the US Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists who believed last week to raise interest rates are now cutting off the central bank’s remaining interest rates in the current 0-0.25% of the central bank. This is evident by a survey conducted by the 80 economists.
“This is a historical situation, as the central bank has been keeping the interest at the top of zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero levels and thus start normalising interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, an older researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of additional dollars into the balance sheet and has accelerated only a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not as rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20.00 in Central Europe.
Delta State University shooter left an apology form
After firing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at the Delta State University of Mississippi, called the emergency number about 10 a.m. in the morning.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
She called the police in an emergency call to her home.
“I shot my wife last night,” Lamb said, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was not too bad for anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting either.
Police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and Lamb, where he read: “I’m very sorry, and I hope I can cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before he took off the spirit on the late Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, director of the University, said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said that Lamb was suffering clearly from something.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentis was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no evidence or evidence of triodrama.
For seven years, Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentis, described his wife as a good man.
The couple had resigned 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said she and Pentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was shocked.
She said she and her mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of the Prentiss, Lindsay Knowles, told us that Prentis worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentis had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told a woman about a dog called Lightning.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called the relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the woods and took off his life.
According to a list of graduates on the University’s website, Lamb received a PhD in Educational Science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dark stars
The past years have been heavy on the actor (with his left son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also been struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything has really demanded its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw page for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will have to stay on the side for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
Hector Moreno, 20-year-old Shaw, was injured in a bad fight in the PSV defense area when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
“Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he is in hospital,” Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or tomorrow for surgery in Manchester.
The young man who joined Manchester United’s ranks at age 18 has experienced hard and is now injured after great gaming methods.
In the suit, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the foot breaks from two points, he's on the page for half a month and he's not playing in the block phase anymore.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno had little effect when the situation was not followed by a red card.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You might conclude yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a two-foot-free tactus.
Shaw said, \"Thank you for all your messages. I can't describe how depressed I am. My recovery begins here and I'm getting stronger.\"
More about Manchester United Luke Shaw in the PSV match
The British defender has a special reason to recover from the European Championships held in France in June.
“It’s a very bad injury,” the PSV coach said.
“In these cases, all parties are always very sorry.
The aim of players is never to harm the opponent.
Moreno broke his legs when playing in Mexico's ranks of Van Gaal's trusted Netherlands only in the 2014 World Championships.
“He’s very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It’s sad to hear that the injury is serious,” Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed like he (Moreno) was involved in the ball, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
“I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this situation can be,” Moreno told SBS6 channel.
“It feels really bad. I’m so sorry.
In addition, the PSV Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris S Modeling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Every parent will notice before long that the child learns his favorite book from the outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s children, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the environmental teacher of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp’s website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “It’s fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I’m happy to read it to my children because there’s always a picture or message we haven’t seen before.
It sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron intends to describe the book’s plot is the 2012 film version summary, which added new characters and details to complement the short-term initial text.
“In the city of Tarville, where the right trees and plants have been destroyed and even the air is commercial, the boy is named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into the heart of Audrey by carrying out this greatest dream: to see the right tree, the text is told. In 1991, the version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted, had no place of love.
Unless this is yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron’s text is partly consistent with the plot formula of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: “In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, the boy is called Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey.
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book plot would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys the wood and manufactures the Tarvits despite the resistance of the name barge Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, fig creature that protects the forests.
Probably this kind of, meaning a little pr task is believed to be an assistant’s job, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times as a child.
The Prime Minister said that the text was probably from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps did not comment more specifically, but confirmed that the text was the hands of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan’s encounter in the Combined Arab Emirates is a tough task, but we are not expected to repeat the last 3-0 Test series in the team selected for the British tour.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a stranger.
The Alastair Cook side can be more experienced than a three-year-long team, but the betting team has good players and the team’s attitude is strong – they have no bad experience in 2012, only young positives.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a circular feeder, and Adil Rashid, although he has no test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the UK Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly difficult for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that the critics are criticized according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best electors.
A few 50-point match would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire.
England’s chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team singer.
The question of how long the Test horse will have the opportunity to make its impression is difficult.
Lyth got seven matches, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton received an opportunity for both home and guest games.
The only issue of appeal is that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in the top state – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team and he's a hit man I appreciate high.
He's an unknown author's cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea is that Moeen will start a betting shift with Cook, which will bring an extra tourr to the game while four fast-eaters are being held, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see a barrier to being a high-end eater here, and this left-handed player has already proved to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have had much time in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been a team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 test matches as the first substitute player before he started in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a backup feeder, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – on average 31 points as a batter and 35 feeders – and this can be a search pattern, but very many tourrs have not shown themselves ready, and the electors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mchain Jaywarden, as a test match adviser can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most stunning men of the species, who brings with it a lot of experience, because he has played against all kinds of attacks and attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be a game trip to the white ball and bring both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced an appropriate international crucifix, whether he is a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has got to take advantage of intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it would say the same thing as before, can be a spray.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's matches, Root got the same chance against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, the trainers and the voters do not set the match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is bad in 2017
David Cameron’s semi-renewal strategy to stay in the UK is in the deeper intestine of the day, even without the desire to please Jeremy, or not – Corbynia’s choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC mocking Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigerian Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained how, in many crises, the EU is in the EU – even though not everyone is in their own hands – some of the Member States have become tired of the self-determination agenda of the United Kingdom, which includes concessions of disparity and harmful changes to the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of the TUC decided that they would not even be comfortable in the EU if it disrupted social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Federal Chancellor will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catch the picture themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value people, return home and tell them they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
“Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says, and suggests that more and more short-looking ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don’t care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a German-minded Federal Chancellor, is an ally, but he has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the power before it is contaminated, as it happened to those who lasted too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or a successor’s choice in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right-wing government, the left-wing government in Spain.
It’s hard to imagine them trying to help selfie-brites who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don’t want it, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may plan to throw themselves deliberately useless comments to the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK national election campaign, which would like to delay Brexit, my friend suggests.
“The most recent negotiations had been held,” he said, “there was nothing left to the UK about the re-negotiation negotiations.
Europeans know how to catch the British magazine and how the EU-Sceptic Oligarchist magazine is, just as Tony Benn was in the 1975 referendum, the result of which was 2:1 in favour of accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remembers Boris Johnson, a knife-like Euro-opportunist, who became known as our EU direct banana correspondent, Brussels at the beginning of the 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include taxes, telephones hacking, and visual housing, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them as much as they did, but then he realized that when he was in a cage with a rough gorilla, he had to stretch bananas into a mess so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was Blair's blonde in opposition to the referendum, and Blair admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was conveniently overcome.
The press never forgiven him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who was friendly with me on the back of Westminster on Monday, told him that he had no more time to waste on me. It could be a risk that he would put in place Neil Kinnock's media book strategy in the '80s. It was a mistake and it's still a mistake.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy with the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC, he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory will probably be able to respond to this.
That's what Hilary-Benn did, but Bennite- Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner boy tried not to admit that Corbyn had a bad bet to call a Karsk John McDonald as a shadow state minister.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father was having difficulty being on television to be a dissatisfaction to his Labour party colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the sub-room.
The difficulties of Hilary were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under all circumstances: McDonald did not say that, nor did Corby say to his colleagues and sub-room members in a private meeting on Monday night.
The desire of Corby to convey how wonderful the picture is, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The visitor is important in the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where healing and fraud are capable.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU, which he could regard as a self-evident support for Labour in the referendum, as McDonald has said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn’s equivocation from EU membership is suitable for the past of the island economy and capitalism. The discussions no longer belong only to the narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea of combining similarity is a central lesson in the doctrineal cumbersome.
The evolution has also been seen for NATO. Tom Watson is inconvenient that Corby does not struggle for his departure. Foreign diplomats have to try to clarify the matter to their homeland.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be unnecessary?
The U.S. has already been quite disappointed with the terrible military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the surgery of the Tory Government. I received a reminder on Monday in connection with the launch of British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the statements of the UK Authority on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by the state-funded institution on the fact that the burning of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were born at a meeting with 12 participants involved in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health Authority Public Health England (PHE) report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE described the report, published last month, to be translated into a review of the results.
However, many researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
In the main article of Lancet Medical Journal last month, “the hapful basis for which the main conclusion of the PHE is based.”
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were established for the \"colle or sand\".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: \"The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on a clear evidence of their effectiveness.
According to McKeene and Capewell, the public assumes that PHE’s claim that, according to the best estimate of the present time, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes, should be based on detailed research results analysis and modeling.
The claim is drawn from one meeting of 12 people, which was invited together to develop the model based on multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA. The model wanted to harmonise the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were collected for research.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included, among other things, EuroSwiss Health, whose former CEO’s independent research has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the Executive Director demonstrated his support in the report on sustainable activities for the functioning of the BT in public health.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting gave funding from the electronics producer, although the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
There is no explanation of the panel’s selection criteria, but there are several known electronic cigarettes supporters, some of which are awarded their participation as a financing agent for industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the field of smoking.
The meeting also took part in the PHE’s tobacco response.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the adverse effects of products on a wide range of products and their criteria.
However, the linkages or deficiencies are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electronic cigarettes can promote children or non-smoking smoking. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
PHE’s health and well-being director, Professor Kevin Fenton said the claims had been answered before.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco. However, long-term effects need to be explored more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what evidence shows and what it does not indicate, especially in a situation where there are no real risks compared to traditional tobacco.
In the United Kingdom, almost 80 000 deaths have been reported annually, and tobacco costs two billion pounds of public health each year.
Responsible action requires us to clearly present the current display that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but their harmful effects are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up East Enders, says Channel 4
Luke Johnson, led by Channel 4, said that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including East Enders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand from hit stars such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used for programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticises the BBC for presenting programmes to a smaller audience at the same time as the major audience programmes of competitors, and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
When President Tony Hall of the BBC announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get Channel 4 in collaboration with the BBC for six years.
“I do not agree with the idea that the BBC will buy formats and send programs that would clearly belong to a competing channel software,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which, in my opinion, is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply at least to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to the best viewing time, because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If no other channel is concerned about the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
“I don’t understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be financed without support,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the East Enders is the second, even though it is its own production.
Many channels would give you the right hand.
I do not understand how this service is provided by the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be a loss for the BBC.
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur, led by Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, and he believes that BBC has managed good viewers because the company is working with ambitious people, and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to former Sky Pomon Tony Ball, which proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sells off the Eastenders-like series.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s Niche programme is shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewer figures cannot most often be measured, but the programs meet their purpose. “BBC can say in its defence of its artificial missions four billion pounds of broadcasting payments were made by special programs that no one looked at.
“BBC will present them at times where no one will ever see them.
Johnson said, \"I've been looking for another one of the old-fashioned systems to get the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks it’s $150 a year, but people for whom it’s a big sum, especially if the BBC doesn’t look at it.
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his own views on the Committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should exchange its old mission with new information, teaching and entertaining.
According to Elstein, the current BBC offer hardly includes teaching programmes – 1 per cent on television and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from the Australian-Canada broadcasting companies and put its mission into a new belief: \"information, lighting and entertaining.\"
The question of cooperation Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts, for example, from the Proms Festival, which was sent last year only to a fraction of the concerts.
Brain cells can be controlled with sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how to change the shuttle bed in its direction when they are applied to ultrasonics.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttles change in their direction when they are applied to ultrasonics, the frequency of which is above the ear of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that responds to ultrasound.
More on: Researchers follow brain activity with light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). Ultrasound is utilized to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritant from outside the body.
The Salk Instuten researcher in La Jolla, California, Sreekant Chalasani, told Guardian that one day the method can replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated with electrical impulses.
Skulls do not normally react to ultrasound. Chalasani found that worms will start to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the caves are amplified by ultrasonic waves that progress in the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion mines, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to a article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttles with ultrasonic Chalasani converted worms genetically so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in the TRP4-ion channels.
When ultrasonics were controlled, the microcircuits strengthened the sound waves and moved to the slopes, when the nerve cell launched a signal.
The method reminds a little bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
Chalasan said that sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optics.
The light is directed to the brain subject to the study with the help of light fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, instead, pass the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be controlled through the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and viral treatment can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasonic signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be utilized in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment – on your home door!
Advertising is a shame for the British arms trade
See Amnesty International's anti-armed exhibition video.
What a terrible killer's orders!
Neck-breaking legs!
Robbery bombs!
Remote devices that cause unacceptable pain but do not leave traces!
A happy voice and cartoons clearly reveal that this ad from the world’s largest arms fairs is parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and is designed to highlight the British administration’s efforts to sell weapons to the repressions of the security and defence industry DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair held at the ExCel fair in the London Docklands.

Bus stops and metro wagons also have posters that require a second look.
Important notice: Do you move on the subway from 15 to 8 September – The notification resembles the announcements of the London Metroway. The picture of the tank is on the other side of the Metroline.
“In September, a number of arms dealers arrive in Docklands. Customers are asked for help in order to terminate the arms fairs.
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruise Designs.
The collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution of posters around London with a six-pound “manospace hacking package” with six-to-a-a-half of the world’s bus stop advertising posters.
Transport for London is not a celebrity vandalism.
One of Special Parol Group's collectivities.
According to Cruel Designs' Curator and Essex University Lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring political work to the audience to see outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art is brought to the real world. Many people move to work with the activists of Protestants.
Another anti-arm trade posters greet public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed via Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the editor have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, gloated the absence of the exhibition and empty encounter in ExCeL's event calendar. He built: \"Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid...
They tried to draw a more realistic, obscured corporate video, but bright colors and animations attract more attention.
“They’ve done a great job and helped us to raise the fairs where illegal torture is being practiced,” says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
“Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded on our home door.
However, the most creative antia in the exhibitions itself is presented in the exhibitions in ExCeL, where the exhibitors make use of the great circular expressions of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the U.S. Army regarding the \"portable AT4CS RS\".
The product includes a “special-shaped battle tip” that effectively penetrates directly to the target.
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Students
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barettes and moral relativism. I only remember now the violent smiles I irritated, and countless, long complaints to others.
The main lessons can be summed up into eight simple rules.
The change in the apartment is the least stressful experience and the worst shocking.
In this situation, you’re easily starting to argue: you’re telling everyone where you’re from, what you like about Corbyn, and why you don’t really hate or love Marmite, because it’s just hiva, hahahaha, I’m in my room.
Sometimes take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other things.
The question will guide the discussion and help you find the people you like and the people you wouldn’t even speak to when your eyelashes were in the manifestations and these people would divide the triggers.
Give the rest of the room.
Their own rooms often work as drinks, cinemas and general living rooms, but there is also a place where they dress, since underwear.
Don’t even think about joining your careers and university studies
The University of Introverts is a tough place
A private room should be a place of calming. However, many apartments have a social culture where they walk from one room to another and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you.
Try to find out if any of your fellow students are tired of social contact. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of pain: knock.
In my own student apartment, there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get friends with baking.
You start your study properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little strange case: \"Health in the neighborhood, I baked something small for you. Smile when I'm drowning for your personal details.\"
Homemade treats are a great way to get new friends.
Your fellow students need to talk to you. Thanks to a pleasant surprise, you can stay a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakeries for you.
If you serve unlucky flour, sugar and fat baked cookers, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common fault in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can your tea pour a drop of milk from someone else's milk can?
Always make sure the milk can't be stored by the owner.
You will probably get a permit, even if the milk loan is the owner of your jar.
I understand very well that it's annoying if someone's trying to take care of you, but try to treat the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own study partner, who's putting the detergent in his milk for the punishment of milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don’t meditate when others try to sleep or go to sleep.
Not only because it's polite, it's also worth remembering that every other hole is digging.
In my own apartment, a girl asked the living room to adjust the music to a smaller one, as the clock was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased volume.
When I finally quiet in the next room, the girl gave the neighbor two hours to sleep, and he left for three hours to move, left the music to freshen his room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move to the same apartment?
And wouldn’t it be strange if you first thought that your fellow student would be your future spouse, would you start dating, differing and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet with your friends?
If the student is definitely not the only one, try to control his desire.
If you notice at the moment that someone has forgotten their keys to the room whose door has not been locked, the limit of sticky and bullying is more attractive than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but one that will recover in a moment.
Hideing some objects can be valuable and fun teaching, but no room should be mixed with toothpaste and sampool.
The door of the second room can lock and drop the keys in a glass of water, which is placed in a freezer, but don’t attach any goods to the ceiling with a pair more.
Racist attack on Kite - The house that was designed for reception center was suffocated in Salo
A racist attack on Kite in North Karelia was carried out on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police said earlier, this is not the accommodation of minors, but the sleeping mats of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Evangelical National School of Kiten.
The windows and walls of the residential facilities of the National University were clogged with racist signs, such as hawks, and a metal object was thrown through a single room window, says the East Finland police.
According to Luukinen, the responsible teacher for social security education at the university’s youth school, the building under the illustrative authority was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some may be elsewhere,” says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are occupied by the National School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as under-age asylum seekers who have only arrived.
All those who are in a messed-up building have a-stations.
Part of a study at an adult school, part of professional studies, and part of a study in Finland, says Lukkainen.
A status is so-called a continuous residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time for a foreigner already in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an injury and a breach of domestic peace.
According to Luke, it was held to students on Monday at the information conference, where the necessary interpretations were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one wants to leave.
We have had another decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have been at least three men and they were on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the top of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception.
The incident happened last week.
On Tuesday night, MTV told us about it.
The hospital’s wall was painted by a hakarist and written in English, “You are not welcome”
The case has been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9 at 16.02 corrected police information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will end the Y-jun to the Karelian Karelia - passengers in their nerves, \"from the idiots of the sky,\"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor’s Karelia ceases to pass in March.
The new one became angry with the passengers on the start of the train at Helsinki’s main railway station.
In particular, the downhill strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says he's coming to the capital with an interview video from HSTV.
There are also train changes in other countries.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nupplinna Tuusula is out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published on Tuesday information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The agreement period changes in the year-on-year and the cease-fire routes are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be subsequently approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström considers that the public train cutter is short-looking.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and bypassing multiple stations.
The Espoolainen Annina Pöyry, on the train, made the fate of the city more remote.
“It’s really bad for those who need to redesign their journey,” he said in his pain in the Y train.
Small relief is promised.
A new train connection will be available for the Beach Beach, which will replace the Y-juna in the Helsinki Region of Transport (HSL), i.e. to the Church.
This brings additional costs to HSL, in practice, for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to carefully assess costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, the HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, the Ministry certainly much more than that.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions in between.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio doubles.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic from the routes of the Joensu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinjoki.
The Pieksämämäki-Joensu route will be shortened as a route to Pieksämäki-Varku.
Train routes are reduced by route to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made per year, with a total of about nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book The Currentity of the Capital: “Marxin is worth getting to know.
World economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his 1867-1894 final work on Capital, writing in a book published today by Yrjö Hakanen, a former president of GDP.
“He is now taken more seriously than a long time,” Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrudement to all sectors of life, concentration of capital, and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly distant.
The book on the list of authors based on the main seminars organised by Hakaske is also found in the Aalto University’s professor, the prestigious economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current and eternal.
Is it not Marxian, however, the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Department of Economics?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences have distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and author of literature.
“The obvious notion is that the history of the wrong opinions of the dead men,” Korkman said.
It's true that Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions that take too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman considered.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical installation.
“The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he said.
Again, we are discussing Marxin’s interests, such as wealth sharing.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of a technical mullation, a changing world,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, Marx is worth studying with Korkman.
“In the 1970s, Marxia could not read,” Korkman said.
\"Mothers and Trotsky and other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more...
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also approach without the ideology and political weights of the years back.
“Every social scientist should explore Marx’s world of thought, as well as other classes,” Korkman says.
The United Nations demands war crimes in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, according to AFP.
The United Nations report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 was published Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated to have died.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, a major attack by the armed forces should be examined properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces Report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women as victims.
The rebels, according to the report, have been accused of forced to fight for by-laws and children.
Both sides have reportedly committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court because foreign judges.
The English yo test was able to print social media.
Syksy’s textbooks had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which most of them had English.
His English skills tested more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, the substance could be written about social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media made us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of the 150-250 word in English could show the web page counseling board to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt responds to the Finnish Leelian lepo chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should look at things for young people as well.
There were four subjects to choose one.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, a third topic in the Swedish school of Porvoo.
In the third topic, it was only a sitat from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was Lybeck's idea.
It had to write a fire call, why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says, and estimates the whole experiment, “the noise is normal.”
In an English test in Finland - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, fell to the adaptation of the summer camel to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday there was also some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Autumn’s writings continue on Friday, when there is another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The tests are organised normally, i.e. the mood of the employees does not affect it.
The College of Colleges invites experienced people to search for appropriate connections in time in order to get to the trial.
You can also get an additional period if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
The trade in Oulu was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, the store was robbed on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the kidnapper had dressed in dark clothes and a comedian covering his face.
A man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to catch.
The case is being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police reserve tens of thousands of protestors arriving in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The government’s protest against cutting decisions will be blocked on Friday at the centre of Helsinki, predicting the police.
In advance, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akaja and STKK will meet at the Railway Agency at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out the alarming tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of the drumming.
Roads leading to the railway sensor will be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi's direction, traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi's traffic circle, westwards from Mannerheimit.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is becoming sub-parts from other countries of Finland because of the state of mind.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
“There’s going to be a lot, but, as a rule, we’re doing it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police call on us to avoid private car travel in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core centre.
A constant traffic is expected from the beginning of the morning.
With protestors from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki is also getting a lot of buses.
They will not be allowed to the Railway Authority.
Buses are in the distance from time to time.
The rest of the trip then has to go to the protest site, Kujala says.
It also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there is also a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings, is now partly self-defenced.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the state of mind to be calmly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local demonstrations are also held on Friday.
Friday's mental expression is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and mental expressions?
The big mental expression organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Heijaninen, a professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it'd raise your hands in front of the government, Soyinen says.
The very right government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s hard claims are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has the place to look at the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all earners for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division whose mind expression creates amongst the one whose ay movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from different parts of Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, held in 1993, he said.
In the middle of the deepest sheep organized by the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (average) the government failed the labour market crisis.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government and the Ay movement are perhaps even worse than the time of the Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland ever, Sohiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict in spite of the words of the Finns.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old labour force movement.
A number of thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The mood expression also stops public transport and potentially closes day care homes as well as schools.
While the demonstration of mind does not receive the undivided support of the employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years, around 300 protests have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're out of line.
Traditionally in the Finnish ay movement demonstrations, it has been quite peaceful - even though operating methods have become more difficult in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, are legal.
They try to avoid damage or destruction of property, the Soyinen says.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The spirit culture changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to put on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
Metal and electric lakes of the 1970s
The 1970s were the most important warehouses in the metal lake in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended at the meeting of the Advisory Board for seven weeks.
Metal men received a 16% salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused electrical losses all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people, many of the sheep unemployed, were gathered to show their views on the job.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers are opposed to the EU 1994 and 1999
Police were in the EU protest against farmers in 1994.
“Siperia teaches, the EU stops,” he said.
The farmers of Espa had a ton of snow.
The Helsinki European Summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hazes in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
A few deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
Tey threatened the strike and the arrests of the nurses in 2007.
At the end of the negotiations, the threat of mass extermination led to a result.
Doctors strike in 2001
Doctors in the strike - from the escape, included a statement by the law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted a five-month period and resulted in a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students march for student support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police finds out that the refugees are full of Finnish trucks for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of the refugee car registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the event in Austria,\" says Chief Commissioner Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling to the truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died with a strangulation.
According to the public radio that first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged, among other things, in restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreigner, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
Refugee long-term captain, former drug courier and uplifted businessman - the story of five smugglers
King of Upporich smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's good for himself.
For example, such people carry out human trafficking within the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and reporter Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers, and the book they wrote in Kuoleman travel agency will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present human trafficking hips, present solution proposals and present smugglers from different stages of business.
HS introduces five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the people of Tunisia are heading there for the summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in the chain, the burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more productive to transport people.
It has been done by Emir with a blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, there are 40 people.
One trip to Emir will make about EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of people wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as you can see fit.
Food is given so that customers are just and live.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends the money, it’s their problem.
We're gonna go to the water in the middle of the night.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea trip is hard, and in 20 metres high waves, passengers cry and throw up.
The human cargo has been bitten in half an hour, and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants him to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the speakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police struck him once, he threw all his passengers over the line and told them to swim on the nearest island.
“I took customers out of the neck, and I threw them over the plate,” Emir says in a book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
They say he has to take this to the ground.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
It's a classic taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bofovasha, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter's engine is pulling at last, and it's seen the best of its days.
However, the main thing for Goran customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bohovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
Located next to the village, there is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre, men who travel without their families will stay in tents, boats and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not filed asylum applications for a reason or another have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia.
Some also stay in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Goran will find most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - via the Balkan route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in a difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
In the end, when they arrive in the region of Bogovasha, a great human trafficking hub, people are dying.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough, Goran thank you.
He said the Africans were trying to do the inks.
Goran doesn't like it.
Stupid fool all the way.
For example, the price will be set at 300 euros, then they will count to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran says he will work less than the others and will charge a ride to the Hungarian border for only EUR 50 per person.
The journey is one mile, most of the road is comfortable.
They say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Gora deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered the taxis not to be transported 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and the trails and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and turns away.
the Work of the Sneaking
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Cambodia, where there are many believers who fled the Congo, as well as a small center where the Congolese refugees are helped.
In addition to islanding, the Ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the messenger to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and takes care that the rubber tape of the white calarids throats in style under the low waist of the jeans.
The messenger is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call some of the five phone numbers of the Messengers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in the midst of the shoppers crossing the border.
In order to get asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, it must be said that there are, for example, war areas in northern Kiev, and that there have been violence in their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID card will be destroyed and the other will be acquired.
It helps with the contact of the Embassy with the Ugandan police.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum application procedure, NGOs, finally UNHCR.
A missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, the handling of documents to humanitarian organisations, and the migration process, for example, to a European country of 4 500-7 000 euros.
Foliot and Ice Plumbers
Tom's a starting smuggler, a former drug criminal.
The four-year-old Irish hit the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on his way to Britain.
He has been assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of trucks who don’t necessarily even know he’s in a human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from someone in the center of Calais.
They drive A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go to prison directly for the organization of illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years due to drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across highways to a resting place where the driver sleeps before they continue across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on the way to England, not even the Netherlands, and to cut the safety guard.
It must be done quietly so that the driver does not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the run, but then the mouth is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps up his client's aluminum foil, the same thing that is wrapped in the kitchen around the baker or oven potatoes.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner from detecting the hideer.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver will not blow up the smugglers at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The Upporic Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the Illustrations of the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is luxury sports: Turkish ports are rented for a few days to visit American or European family-friendly tourist trips.
In reality, ships are loaded with bulking Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000, first from Istanbul to some port and sea in Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People are being landed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for signs.
When it is given, you have to get to the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep the whole trip hidden under the deck.
Seaguards can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomiting, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ferry trip after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hire the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to manage the work for himself.
During the summer season, transports will be held at least hundreds and Küçük will earn millions.
He said he bought over 100 apartments from the country, the pharmaceutical company, and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He has disappeared since then.
Correction of 16.9.2015 at 15.10 p.m.: The book of the death travel agency will appear here, not next week.
American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and driving to prostitution.
Sports Illustrated published a book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came into the competitions in the top state and ran in the box for the second best time.
In the final, however, he was panicking.
At the beginning of the day, he ran and defended his leadership with a ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was erupted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
However, I was forced to cross the line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-way disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before Sydney's race, and he himself felt huge successes.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with other men.
He also called on his husband to accept his work.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on the luxury life.
One of the explanations of Favor Hamilton as a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had received in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two-way disorder.
The double life of the former star drink became apparent at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world’s statistical field at 3.57,40, but remained in Sydney’s Olympic final.
The world champion exhilarated when the union put Norway under the ski bowl: “Suoraselkäinen,” he said.
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of fit in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have voted for the entire summer and in the autumn of last year a sports contract.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multi-time world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian ski union decided to close Northug out of the world Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union had put a ski bowl under control.
Thank you for pointing the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he said.
The dispute between Norway’s ski union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the nation team so that he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a covenant that also takes care of future generations, and does not give one athlete in solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the alliance had given Northug both financial and other special rights for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has very different rules than just because it is the best.
Northug released his own announcement on Tuesday, where he assured he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the world Cup, as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals, of which two gold medals.
He was part of the last winter in the band that won the message gold.
The driver's day is also celebrated in Northern Finland.
On Thursday, 25 September, stamps will be held in different restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Paisin translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that all high-quality restaurants have not focused on the metropolitan area, but on top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the thyroid nutrients and the organisation.
In northern Finland, the restaurant is held in Vaasa, Fondi and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, there is a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make one of the most important international events held in the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kahahava reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the newly owned Kauhava ex-sert.
According to the complaint, the region remains a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partners, namely the Finnish Erillisverts Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building group would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the former Airport School and the airport, which have not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre.
The report states that for the Kauhava field for the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the possible arrival of a foreign operator to the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition from the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The management means that the arrivals and the arrivals have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting with all the presidents of the parliamentary parties in Mäntynniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all the participants.
He values that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to speak with confidence in the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the US, can also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Niinity is desirable in terms of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the issue of NATO was also discussed.
The president did not take a stand on the situation in the labour market.

The Early Education Office will announce further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a huge risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to reporters in the parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio phones will become.
Speakings are not always transmitted in the future on Yle channels.
If other channels are reported as a channel, then let's see.
This channel is now being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio call to the public.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a further justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä survived.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20, both on TV1 and on Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
The Sipilä Takes A Big Risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television phone will not tell you more about the inward turn of the government.
Is it an effort to define public debate more strictly in their own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions of the public debate? asked by Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and let it define himself.
In the name of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these things will not be related.
It is understood that commercial media has become nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not advertising issues in democracy.
The task of media representatives is to define the objective of not taking political agendas into consideration.
The TV is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in a different way, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, it is necessary to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
There is a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be marked as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interest or general policy.
From the door to the door
In the upcoming speech, it is also important that what the Prime Minister leaves without saying, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we need to look closely at where Sipil is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutt, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to six, the TV call is a Sipile door-to-door bet, because this is how this can bring its own view up without the ringtones.
In this way, the public will receive a public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipily passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the risk is that the media interprets something wrong with the speech, because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to six, it is very important how Sipila appears on TV - a whirlpool of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If the Sipilä knows how to do it well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government would inform something about it, because it is a person who speaks directly to another person.
This is what President Barack of the United States is doing on a regular basis.
Really exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be very exceptional to the citizens.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns feel comfortable with the tensions ahead of them.
The employees’ organisations organise protests and strikes against government action on Friday.
On Twitter, President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could keep his speech on the state of the nation in the representation of the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again, announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
Now is not the time for monologues.
Soon, half a year from the election.
You can't hide for the rest of the time, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on a hiking trip has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of the Interior Finland also confirms the matter to the newspaper.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Last night, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanked all the people who helped him.
Thank you for these 10 contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was split closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed with the violent bullying of young people: You get angry
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which appeals specifically to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and who was five years old with his family in Finland, has won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
The account has been downloaded videos where young people fight with extremely violent take.
Amirhani says she's disappointed in the bullying of young people.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other, and beat the eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that are caused by this when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in the region.
Namely, you're fighting on the streets of your head.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has sites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
It's a little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are sometimes subject to racism, you will be charged with it yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go with that, guys.
Amirhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You'll get the anger I don't like myself.
You've got things pretty bad, and you're not gonna make them better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions Monday
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on Monday from its alternative savings presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the Government to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (average).
Mr Fjader believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKK and Ava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation to soften its position earlier.
Mr Lyly, president of the SAK, commented in short on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock and the need for contracts concluded by active parties in the place of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, the Sipilä cut off the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: A great demonstration threatens to choke - I think it's a little funny to put on a fist.
It's a little funny to put a fist in your pocket, if you already have a match paper, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods differ from the width of the employee camp.
Is it meant to scream at the government, or does it agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK will wipe out the sacred hatred of the Republic’s government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat also spread to wealthy people.
OAJ threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of the STTK’s STTK, Antti Palola (sd), appeared in agreement.
He said that he had contacted the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity block, which was required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (average).
Mr Fjäder (kok) immediately said that his so-called paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office did not belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the presidents told the country to stand on Friday.
However, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for wage earners, the SAK should be inclined to accept the 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations with the Sipilä Government.
The right hand of Palola, Director of the Social Impact of STTK, was previously the special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said the government’s ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Sattumaa or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of clean away from Finland's staggers, whose enchanting image of the ACP Marko Pirateinen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a match paper in your pocket.
Custom at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again.\"
President Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duuma President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better Etyj father than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has started the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Etyj, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow the entry of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to be forced by the European Union, to attend a meeting - a matter from which the President would remind journalists.
It is estimated that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctios are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk declared.
Mongolia’s Russian delegation got complicated, so Naryshkin continued to hide Finland by thanking and thanking Mongolia for the different organization.
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (cook) who has already discussed Russian delegation.
The lock encounters a real playoff mirror: \"The models are tight.
In Hakamets, both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets you will not see real goals.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night to go to the 3-year-old KalPasta.
The rise was masculine, for the silver group of the last season was the worst of two goals.
It was more than a million times a week ago.
The Blues, which had been taken on board by the peacefuls, had a round zero score, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of the games are playing the same game as last year, Dragon Lahti predicts settings on the club pages.
Tappara has been formed by a pretty playoff button for the Ramadians.
In the past two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the final series of Luka.
On both sides, the solution is required for a decisive seventh race.
In the last season, the Luku took the series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose to three next side and passed.
There are no major changes, except in groups.
Both of the counter-attacks will have a lip shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the plugs, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Vision: The story begins with a terrible play
The sports director, Loutila, handed the chief coach to Rautakalli to an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone directed the Rocky film, where he himself played the main part.
The defendant sent a sensationally to the world champion of the heavyweight series, Apollo Creed.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Suola handed her to Pora as a restless ashtray.
The nameless and wooden baker has moved on to all the surprises of the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of Rocky-like nameless but tough subsidizers.
It was White Indian, Porin Matta and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-down games, players painted their heads red and cut the irony.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo was called Coach Neumann.
You've taken the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Hopela believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Essiens has built the devil in the hands of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have rotted waste in a remote area like Rocky pig feeds at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholman, and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way outside of the field.
Hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Colony Sean Conneré.
Rautakallio is one of the most popular performers in Rocky as Connery would have been in the 1976 originals.
There's nothing left of Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
Rautakallion’s game philosophy is not part of a rhythming and adolescence.
He appreciates a tough game, but there is a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Ässien Garret Stafford's tactice to the head of the Tapparan Jere Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don’t accept such a game and it’s not part of an ass-knit, and after the game, the Rautakallio hurried to the people of Satakun.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are gentiles, veterans, policemen, and cranberries.
There are no key players in the game age in practice.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite narrow, and Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
I'm going to take a ride.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of Toola as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The current balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
I would not have liked to have written the next part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in his husband’s direction.
Yeah, I'm gonna play my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Abilanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but for the first time, Olga plays in Tuuka’s direction.
Olga’s role in the early years of Abilna is the drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother Sirkka.
The sleek tsemppa and supports his son, although his father Risto (who present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I’ve met my real example of Sirka, the easier it feels to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and told me.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the drama is drama and the truth may need to be painted a little.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Autila would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was a flat and really hard.
It was quite a small probability that someone would really succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth before filming.
The parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil story.
Olga was an everyday girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the top, he could have been in love with me.
According to Olga, over the past 10 years, he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now, the entire production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in ancient Israel often plans to drive home because of their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to take over the entire Heinola for a month.
They have taken us very warmly, asking only what streets and when they will be empty.
Iron Sky 2 was the most expensive performance film in Finland
The Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
The director of Timo Vuorensola begins to photograph Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive performance film in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been in Jalmar Helander Big Gam.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over €100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma start in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios and last eight weeks.
Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been very relaxed!
I have such a relaxing file about the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie you should come up with.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience.
Originally, 8-10 million were planned for the film budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but there is also a big studio.
However, 100 million people would get caught in the film, because each aspect and the effects are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no loose.
Iron Sky Universe, the production company of the film, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowd loan on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
Among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green, and Vladimir Burlakov play.
Train or cool?
Big logos return to the shirts
The breasts of the Trendsters have recently decorated large logos.
Some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in his console.
Advertising a dropper or T-shirt was seen as a train.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so are the old, familiar sports stamps such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolity wave brush.
And as often as before, the funny and trendy limit is alarming: if something is already right, it begins to become irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where the trenders surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey base collegen, it is already placed on the bottom of the cabinet, which is before which the manufacturer's logo is commanded.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas radar curtains, the game shirts of the favorite team and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
At the beginning of the jeans, the beginners' Calvin Klein logos are now cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace’s syscuses makes it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I didn’t feel like I was stuck in a tank hole!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove from the large-sized Zotov tank compartment for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be cursing about the banker car door in a very good atmosphere and not at least on the basis of their images.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the combat tank, but it was a front-end tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and came out in peace, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov, the Russian army's TV channel, explained in his exhibition the new technology of Russia, because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the cars, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all tanks and all the front-end tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and rotive, but nothing like being stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba's novosteii radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged chat has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people in the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov’s chat started with the story of Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told of his extremities when he tried and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a follow-up, where the organisers of the exhibition told their views about what happened.
Everyone has become accustomed to the rapid jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his big composition, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

10 points to the impact of Friday's site on you - see the video!
The demonstration of trade unions will take place on Friday at 11-13 p.m., but the strike will have a significant impact on the lives of citizens for a long time - throughout the day and even beyond.
IsTV explained on 10 points how Friday’s style affects citizens.
Look at the effects of the video on road and rail transport, both in the transport of goods and passengers.

The Kittilä mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland has been leaked.
The clean-up process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandal to its stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
At the bottom, the foaming process is neutralized by the enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped either to be reused as a process water or transported to the environment through the surface lighting field, as permitted.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour after it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leaking water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
There was no change in the substance in the environment.
The year was found in the round of inspection at the country-wide office.
The year has not been found to cause structural damage to the building structure of the pool.
The company reports that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns you to cut too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the IMF, largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization fled structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the contract system and unemployment security.
According to the Danske Bank’s headquarters, the structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of portable communication for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning of what should not be too cut.
Such are infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy.
The IMF also considers that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, rising to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicts that today’s new business forecast will continue to grow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuopopäki said.
It is possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the problem is just a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, under Satoru Iwata, who worked under the cancer, Tatsumi Kimishima starts working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for monitoring Iwata’s footprints, evaluates Ace Research Analyst Hidek Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being heavily involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
Finland is becoming more and more minors.
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.
The case has been reported, among other things, by Dagens Nyheter on his website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, that hundreds of minors are lost annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants are lost in the country under - year? - In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013 alone.
They disappeared 9.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and were lost in 11, Kannelmaa says.
In the light of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be a full age there.
In that case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and return to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were made in the event that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he said.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications that came alone.
There are no missing asylum seekers this year, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of lost people, he emphasizes.
What happens to those who have made a conversion decision?
They are also lost in the labour market, for example.
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered country seekers.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who asked about refugee issues at the EU's Home Affairs Conference, told us about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. Studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen for TV and radio production is now on sale.
Mikkoinen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional equipment in his field.
It was the first time I told you about the Nett.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer described for Betacam.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that you will find those interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are a lot of enthusiasts – collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to turn away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the goods with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being handed over.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio devices.
It is clear from the traces of chronic strokes that a man who made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskyla.
Traffic threatens to fall out of poetry worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's mood.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the time of the protest scheduled on Friday.
In the afternoon, you will find out if the traffic will stop all day.
President Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great on the field.
Night and day cuts are very bright for drivers, so government plans to cut the blues will create resistance.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport is almost entirely at stops in the metropolitan area.
According to VR, trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no road or long-distance traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be driven to the stations.
According to HSL, the majority of buses remain in a variety.
The members of the ACP are away from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the premier, HSL reporter Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says that HSL can’t say exactly what bus lines are going on Friday.
The employees’ organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, according to the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas - the teacher thought he had a watch for his own.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher thought he had brought a clock to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics to the production.
One of the teachers, however, kept the clock looking like a bomb.
The police were invited to appear, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the armbands.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the clock had been shown to be a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police store, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital screen, between which there were leaders.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days by forced leave from school.
His father is angry with the incident and the American-Islamic Council of the country is considering whether the case is again one indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain - Labour Director refused to sing national singing
In the song, God is called to protect the queen, but Corbyn is a opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party MPs have also been united in the review presented by the illustrious press.
This has hurt the people, and Kate Green, a labour candidate, said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought that Corbyn should have joined the song.
In yesterday's memorial meeting, British Air Force pilots were honoured with the battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in enormous gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He stood with respect during the national song, and the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn’s choice as a party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who are afraid of his destitute moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, cessation of savings and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is to appear as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron's novel on Twitter for the week to become a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for the case.
South Lake Minnetonka's police have been investigating a week of family deaths in Minnesota Greenwood.
The five-year-old family was found dead on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shooting of his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Days of the Years
The family was found after the school was worried about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the Short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of Houses and Successful Businesses
The investigation of the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siair is still underway.
The motive for blood vessels is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune’s interview, Short announced that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I have received 50 purchase offers from the company over the last 10 years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen among other things by the fact that Shortt's family bought a crazy house from Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised as a dream of a car dealer in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with a sufficient garage.
The case of the matter of justice
StarTribune said the family father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various presupposition courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, it was not removed from Shortt’s website from presupposing comments, and so they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, StarTribunen is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on the operation of Short.
Vesku Loiri offers cake coffee
In addition, the owner’s colony was awarded the Finnish Hippos month horse owners’ prize.
This is great, Loiri said in a good mood of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist’s legend, Loiri, was still confused with the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loir, the master of the success horse, Korpi gets full work with the horse.
Pekka will determine where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loir.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star - the greatest gift made by the athlete of all time.
Montreal Canada’s superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about $6.7 million) to Montreal’s children’s hospital.
According to the hospital’s report, it is the largest sportsman ever made an individual donation to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canada eight years ago and $72 million a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than its $9 million year-on-year.
Subba receives a lobby with its name from the hospital.
Canadian players have previously helped local hospitals significantly.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other major hospital in the city, where the PET scanner needed for cancer studies was received at the hospital.
The Japanese cafe can order a wife for the evening - serves only the bikinis and the essus on its head
The theme cafés are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat café, a canoe café, a vampire café, a fish café and now a wife cafe.
It hits lonely, seductions and hungers.
It's about Metro.
In Tokyo, the Ore no Yome (My Finnish wife) cafe can be ordered for the night of a wife or husband.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a customer’s spouse.
\"Puoliso\" is chosen from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just an essus and a bikini on her head, while the husband is in tight biking shorts.
The website offers all the information about length and weight of the spouses at all times as they prefer to sleep on the mattress.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the launch of attacks against car security
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the information published by Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that around 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve car cybersecurity, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best security practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS will cost approximately EUR 52,000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six ascending.
At last, the car starts to be in sight in Finland.
Ford published the RS data now that the car world’s views are at Frankfurt’s car show.
Ford’s new four-wheel RS accelerates in a 2.3-litre, 350-hov power engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 km per hour.
In Finland, there is also a price, initially it is said to be EUR 52,000.
The car is now available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you.
Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Auto Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, two new ones are certainly more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia is planning to capture the ever-growing street masturbating market.
The new Sportage created by Gregory Guillaume, a new European design leader, is more round than ever.
There has been a cent in between axles and external dimensions, and the car cracks the air more efficiently.
The engine range has its main characteristics, but it has to be added to the 1.6-litre turbo to develop 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportaga and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage comes to us in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats were in our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a new car.
Kia will conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Starting with 1.7-litre turbodiesels and 2.0-litre petrol engines, Optims are available.
In the next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farm begins.
Chisu returned to the ship - looted in a bold hammer suit
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have to look like an open neck hole.
The apartment presents a beautiful song star with a siro belt.
The total is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who became a mother has received a pregnancy kilos with a light movement and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be a year soon.
The singer released his first single album in August.
Back to the stage and before the general public, after a long break, I’m not really excited.
It has been a shame to do everything related to music, the singer says.
Chisu will publish his fourth album in Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother's style of obsessive resembling - now visible to the breast
Real-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives topics for one after another.
She introduces her pregnancy and bra in her sexy clothes, last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian from her husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the front of the breasts.
It exposes the skin-colored bras under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
The last time Kardashia dressed in an amatsonic maternity school was when she visited her friend for dinner in New York only a few days ago.
The status was emphasized by the black superstitutes.
The third special maternity care is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the show was on her pregnancy.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
Mano Leloup wanted to have an idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths of pure model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar gathered the six hard truths behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if in the previous period you had been living with top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
Every season comes into the field new, fresh faces that compete from work with concasions.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the property is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be immeasurably difficult.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but Paris says you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Fashion models and designers are constantly together, while operating as a support network.
When the fashion is over, the difference is fragile.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are so pale that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
The work makes models feel like they are actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
The models were in Tory Burch's show yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers will reveal their next year’s design.
Roope Salmine, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Abitanta music in the movie.
Roope Salminen presents an Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta group.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm going to present 16-year-old guitarist Salmine laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before the descriptions, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it's very good that I'm just teaching her play style from the video.
I don't want to make a imitation of a person.
A man who trusts Roope Salmine and Dogs does not play a role.
The Punk-Maners come with a man in nature.
The stars, the stars in the punk period of the program, certainly, many saw the first taste, as well as if they have ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a long-lasting thing, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main performers of a beautiful film directed by Tuukka Temose were announced today.
A nuclear group familiar to the band’s audience is still present to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumple Sipe Santapukki is presented by Teppo Manner, a singer from Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka from Temoo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salmine gave a hint of his coming wash last night, when he told Snapchat mysteriously to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new genre in Instagram that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the figs and jaws, has shaved his face into silopous, and painted his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have recently wondered how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about at all?
There is no need to talk to the people, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children can’t always understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and anxiety, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard of the refugees on television, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones older think he is afraid of.
It's not worth scaring yourself, even if you're afraid of yourself.
A small child is closely following the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves stay calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should talk to them if they think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not doing well.
Parents, together with children, can wonder how our families are dealing with this.
Is the world a safe or secure place at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This can be useful for him in the future.
Janne Viljamaa, a social psychologist: “Keep your child to help you become weak.”
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermonic Pallosalamaa difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola got caught in the middle of Apila Pallosalama.
It only doubled the profits and the 2nd seasons until at the end of July the ruin occurred in the Tampere ruins.
Because the slave was initially suffocated, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his guard from the vet for the time.
The explanation for the exit was clear in the constellation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the slightest way to go, but it required two courses of medicine.
As Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light movement, Pohjola says he was happy with the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku in a record time after the second SE dam.
Apila Pallosalama was very pressured from the hiatus when it could only drive a few weeks normally.
Those things were understandable at the end of the process,” Pohjola said.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made a blade for the slave.
The horse must have moved on, and hopefully it would also have been balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When you haven't been interested in it, it could have thrown into the fat without the sick.
On a good day, the Ori has, on the other hand, broken up such a mystery that the opponents have been in their wonders.
At the speed of the game, the players don’t go to Pallosalama, which even removes warm-blooded rides.
In the North, there is a soft drink in Vermo.
However, it is different how Apila Pallosalama agrees to it.
It's pretty difficult at the time of departure, and you might wear it under the boom of the departure car and something like that.
I hope the slave would be calmer than Turun's departure.
Apila Pallosalama is also able to come from the neck, and we are going to drive it out of victory, coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of bad iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Vints come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became forced to upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple’s programs is more complicated than it seems on the top.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-year, Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices slowed down the decline in energy.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed a slightly lower estimate of 0.2 per cent from a couple of weeks ago.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called basic inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2% cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation in the whole 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1%.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
Cyprus's inflation rate was 1.9 per cent at low prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% lower according to the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area's inflation continues to be a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the two-and-a-half-highest price rise in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for this year.
The next year, the rise will increase to 1.1%, the central bank predicts its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next recession in the United States begins at its fastest in less than a year, but more safely within three years after the country’s central bank of Fed takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And in the financial market, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he should start the interest purchases this week and not later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at its fastest by next autumn and as a course break in the financial market before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets work as they have been, and if they react to Fed’s financial extremities as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank in London’s market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The bank shared more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study research report for its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics through the cool facts and calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved before and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and the financial markets now in the same way or in another model as in previous interest rates - and what may be followed.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a much worse position to withstand the rise of interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recovery may not be a year.
Fed’s monetary policy and its officials have been determined over the last summer and early autumn, suggesting that time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first prize for more than nine years can be reached this week.
The matter will be resolved during the mid-week and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed Board will decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds steering rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular but at the same time a series of interest rates of a small 0.25 percentage point, at which Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25 % to 5.25 %, ended.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the U.S.’s most risky housing funding, and one year later the financial crisis became a global judge-day nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious financial market and real economy failures began more slowly than the previous Federal interest rates have typically happened.
Similarly, the experiments were tougher and tougher than the 1930s.
Deutschen’s strategies have focused on the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies, as well as the financial market conversions since 1950, and I will be in place from the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed’s interest rates and their financial and financial impact have been made clear since the 1950s.
Upon the start of the recovery, the fastest time has passed less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within a year or two from the start of the Fed interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has raised and shifted its steering rate to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has deviated from others in some respects, and the odds are relatively limited in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies point out that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be discovered in decades of research.
But three things about the victims of the crisis and the causes of its destruction may seem to be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks of the world held their steering rates too low in the 21st century.
They planted traces of the technokuplan, and at the same time grew the next.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and above all too much debt, increased by the overrun of the central banks' monetary policy.
The largest debt double was born in the economic history of the past.
3) In particular, debt financing, which packed the financial economy with the most limited arrests, increased the number of exchange coupons from shares to real estate, debt certificates and commodities in most financial market areas.
There is hardly any doubt that the financial markets raised to the highest levels in terms of ever more complex debt errors were in rare dangerous and unstable trouble when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
The financial structures that were imposed on debt instruments were not as long as their time after the interest purchases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned to an increase.
The risks were implemented as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not think what will happen next, but give a nuclear issue by mentioning, for example, the following issues:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy like ten years ago, but now debt money is cheaper literally than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been diminished, but now in different parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued as the lowest and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial market and has reduced the main securities and assets to the highest or ever before the peak of the financial crisis.
Not only are the financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the worst recession to the model that has happened before.
The euro area’s economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is next to tighten his money supply to a stronger extent.
Perhaps the French bank’s picture of the future of Societe Generale’s strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it can suddenly be.
He has already trained the bank’s international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break down, and soon it's time for Fedin to turn off the financial shocks with even greater QE cash cuts.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP), which manufactures computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at the HP Business Service Party, the company says.
HP is divided into HP Inc., focused on business sales, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and consumers.
HP’s personnel amounted to a maximum in 2011 when it had 350,000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been cut to 302000.
The company will record one-off costs of $2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
The reduction of the consumer side will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to the countries of migration so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company already tells us that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its business results.
In the second year, its three most important customers brought 65% of their business results.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the management of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centrally).
According to Yle, the company’s activities are related to so-called tax planning.
It's about the Luxemburg company Saltri II LuxCo, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself said he left a statement of disparity in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a distinction.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on a agreed schedule, Berner says in Yle’s interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a retailer who merged with the Finnish retailer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upoflor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and in Luxembourg.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownerships go through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the membership of the government at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the government of Karel-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs’ largest owner, the capital fund Triton, was already ready for ownership by the Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens the company’s service centre
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-maintained reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening.
The number of seats can increase within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation University.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is primarily the production of healthcare and healthcare services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on the safety arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work life tightening package
STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government’s labour tensions.
The organization also wishes to involve other employees’ organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being given to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone realizes that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the withdrawal of the organization’s administrative meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EK) is not ready for discussions instead.
The ESC's economies have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the second half of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if half of the huge enthusiasm is to have a conversation if there's a one-way relationship.
Palola: A negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centrally) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the Government is to give a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has always been constructive of him.
In particular, the operation of the Sundays on the STTK field is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation in which it would implement part of the tensions.
In the STKT, Palola does not suggest that the alternative package should be prepared with the SDP that has been present.
The employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life package presented by the Board last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary of the first disease days is cut, overtime benefits are halved, Sunday compensations are reduced to 75% and the holidays are shortened.
The STKT emphasizes that the central organizations have called employees into the mood, and they have not been in a position to strike.
Akavan Fjäder
Mr Fjäder, President of the program, welcomes the STKKK's notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, STKKK is now coming to the same lines with Akakka, as the program has already outlined a longer alternative model for government proposals.
Fjader hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as the SAK package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The ambitious president, Sture Fjäder, hopes the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, to prepare the presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said she was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan announced on Wednesday that it had been preparing its own presentation for a long time to negotiate the five percent competitive advantage of the country’s government as an alternative to surgery.
The program has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akaja lines, as STKK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjader.
On Thursday, the Committee of the Regions will meet at 15 a.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Green Left of the University of Tampere
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening of Vivan bingo.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
At the request of the former Prime Minister, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio call, which marked the beginning of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped on television.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The Sipil’s speech has sparked criticism and ideas all day about what I’m going to like.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that “The Sipila could hold its speech in the state of the nation in the representation of the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well.
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, “one phone call has already been seen.
Leadership is dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judges condemned “Monarchist Meinings: The Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “After six months of elections.
There is no single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded and held in advance for about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented in direct transmission by SAK President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyr Häkämämäminen, EC CEO.
The above is appreciated for the speech of Sipilä.
We considered the matter and found that it was part of the public service task to promote comprehensive public disclosure throughout Finland, the line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, President of Yle publications.
It's like we at Tammel's time.
The speech has also sparked looseness.
The dinner that arrived tonight is enjoyed in good time, the children are being taken and put on their best.
My mother puts on her nicest skull and my dad agrees on her neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be on television before we're at Tammel's time, writing a blogger, Saku Timonen.
“In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also asks why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millions of people hiding in its capitals, which are making love laws for other tax collectors, and at the same time telling the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has the end of the money,” asked Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It has published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the debt and the team?
Coupons and pens complete, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the withdrawal of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's United Nations ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to have escaped from power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not adhere to the proposal because they believed Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Thurk wrote to him in a two-way discussion on three plans: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition between the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a slow manner.
I know Thurk.
We may not agree on all matters, but we can speak openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said he was sitting down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics don't comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the conversation, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
U.N. diplomats also refused to comment on the claims of Ahtisaari, but said that Al-Assad’s troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which he would have left power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is suspicious of the words of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The fact is that the Tshurk spoke with the authority of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's stick to hold power with some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow in our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no other option than to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying for the bill that we have caused, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
the Asylum Seeker Organization Centre in Toronto
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio co-operation building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen, vice-president of the City Council of Tornio, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation to the next Monday to decide on this matter, he would specify it to the STT.
At the meeting there were 36 delegates from 43.
The organization centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On the basis of that, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers in the community at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would be working in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä is still looking for an alternative to the labour market for blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally).
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations are able to agree on this.
Sipilä told reporters that he was not in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for substitutes for the criticisms of the working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it with no other pleasure as part of the whole package.
Half of the holidays in Sipilä’s view would be a tool, as it would be directed at almost all earners, unlike the Sunday cuts planned by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree to cut the holidays because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision on Wednesday next week to the Parliament on labour disputes in the form of a Communication from the Government Council.
According to Sipilä, organizations' proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final coverr either.
The legislative work then goes on, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting harder all the time.
Now's a good time.
In such matters, it won’t take much longer, if there is a desire, the Sipilka formed.
The list published last week by the Board includes, inter alia, the conversion of the end-of-the-end and helatorstat into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary of the first disease days is cut, overtime benefits are halved, Sunday compensations are reduced to 75% and the holidays are shortened.
The reforms are implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these activities, the employees’ centres organise a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have declared political cracks.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the expansion of the juicery warehouse
The Council unanimously approved the extension of the stock of the management of the Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the juice hall.
The assessment was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had originally been said.
A busy schedule is also painful.
It was also a little surprising that the order needs were not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 square meters was approved in the Investment Programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the Interim Report.
The agenda also discussed the investment of EUR 150,000 to €200 000, but at the meeting the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the local government.
The municipality has no risk as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) was founded.
In the language of Karelia, there is also a place in Joensuu.
The city government has reduced its previous steep stance to bring street names to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of the election of the cattle tradition throughout the country.
Joensu is not declared the capital city of the herd, because it has no historical grounds and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Riversuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savoy.
After a new decision, the city centre will not be listed as the street name villages.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, ready to use the language of the herd, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended for all other actors.
Although the municipality is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth having a casual attitude to the use of the language of the herd now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the special features of the county, as well as the image of Joensu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both of them can be very useful in a wide range of marketing in the county.
Train connection interruptions reduce the vitality of the county
The cuts in connection with trains hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And the effect is whether there can be a place to live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, is wondering.
He also highlights air traffic, which has been on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that we do not support the possibility of reducing the power of state, as is now taking place.
We should look at the effects of the termination of these transport links, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes the University of Eastern Finland an additional challenge in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as traffic connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the director of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He notes that bad traffic connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travel a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the University towards Western Finland because the traffic connections are weak in the opposite direction.
Currently, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
More than 10-20 percent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensu has become one of my ringtones for the Battle of Siu
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the rural Siu War project is seemingly unanimous, but there is one among the ringtones.
The City Government member Pentti Centralsalo (sd., pic) presented the entire project to the Board at a meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the decision-making proposal by the Mayor of Karelia, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though one train pair is less frequent.
There will be changes to the passenger train between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train pair is left out, but there is still five days to get from Kotkka to Kouvola and vice versa.
Supplies are due to state-saving measures.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years is reduced by 12.3 million euros.
The most quiet routes will be completely terminated.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out of the place.
The rescue department saved the climber from the roof to a 12-year-old who could not get his own help off the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionmäe on Ketotie at half a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-layer wooden house in the area, where there are no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not prevent the boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of them were living out of place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the final roof safely back to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's turnover in exchange for fluctuations, weaker prospects for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its last quarter weak results. The transport sector dropped its performance projections throughout the year due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s share fell by about 2.5% 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast has a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated on average despite the price increases of 4.9%. The increase will enter into force on 4 January.
The company is still expecting revenue growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has been well-awaited in a weaker economic situation, which has tried production and global trade in particular.
The schedule for hiring seasonal workers was informed the day after the competitor UPS announced plans to employ the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90,000 and 95,000 people.
In the fourth quarter of August 31, FedEx’s operating profit was $692 million, which means a 6% increase.
The stock-specific result was $2.42, and then the 12 analysts of the Zacks Investment Research company, a $2.44 forecast, remained.
The turnover increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been experimenting with a decrease in international third-rate shipments, which is why the company's Express unit has been in place.
The strong growth in online trading has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29%, but operating profit showed an increased cost of large-scale shipments and insurances.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight business fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the actual trade, FedEx's stock exchange rate had dropped to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $115.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average year and 17 per cent from the highest notation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Governors of the Federal Central Bank of the United States will meet at the most anticipated meeting for years. The group will sit at its diameter at the eight-metre-feet bar to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
On the wall of the two-storey meeting room of the central bank, the wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Mr. Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the State's financial interests ahead of all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank’s management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be lacking in terms of the painful decision. On Thursday, the central bank is expected to announce whether the US economy is ready to start the withdrawal from an unforeseeable stimulus offered by short interest rates close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows the economic growth steadily, recent financial market collapse can already be completed by cautious central bank officials to lay down the increase in volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate – even in the fourth quarter of the percentage unit.
“The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of the banking business Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market is to give a sufficient reason yet,” Piegza said.
Those who are considering the matter do not agree with what the central bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in Bloomberg’s study stimulated the increase in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected, and according to the key indicator there is only a 30% chance of withdrawal.
If the central bank increases its control rate, the stock rates can be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising another lift.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index cut 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
“In the background of the collapse, there were expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week,” said John Lonski, chief economist of the Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage,” he said.
“If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands on the financial market untangled.
In turn, the other experts pointed out that increasing interest rates could help to calm the financial markets and eliminate the uncertainty of when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be more expensive to raise interest rates of 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said that the spring and early spring has been expected to increase interest rates this year – despite the need for economic progress according to the Liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in the last month, at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates for full employment.
Wages appear to be stressful
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual targets of 2% of the central bank, the decision-makers of the central bank indicated that the key reason for this is the temporary impact of the oil prices.
“The economy can be earned with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take into account the strict situation in the labour market,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
However , the financial markets around the world are not alarming in the last month when China devalues its currency.
Down Jones’ industrial aveage dropped up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors were afraid that the recession in China would also affect global growth.
The market has been squeezed this month, and Dow Jones has already dropped nearly 10% of May’s top readings.
The fall of the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will be further complicated by considering the increase in the steering rate.
“The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened in the financial market and the news about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he believes the central bank is waiting for at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is a great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little certainty about the recent developments in the Chinese economy,” Oliner said.
Global economic recovery is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body of the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, only a hint from President Ben S. Bernanken was made of the fact that the central bank could narrow its scope of operations by creating shocks around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to the monitoring of the world’s trends, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
“The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Strategy of the Financial Management Company Envesnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker Richmond’s regional central bank said this month that the central bank had previously over-represented the financial market movements that did not seem to have a link to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Fedoral Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
“The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the steering rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth,” he said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
“The central bank should put monetary stability first and foremost in a major crisis, as in the economic collapse of 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last drop is not even approaching those things, he said.
“The rise of the cucumbers in no way should be feared due to market shock,” the Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
“The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability. Before this change comes, I do not want to go ahead of things.

The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Association promotes a decent diet for mammals
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching nursing women the meaning of a decent diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-feeding with unhealthy food images.
The human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby receives all the nutrient they need and can develop a strong immune system.
As a result of extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie quantity by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, additional changes to the diet should be made in addition to increasing the calorie volume.
Robert Waterland’s recent study of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that a healthy diet for a pregnant woman can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven of the most viewers in Sunrise, even though Nine is trying to get the lead position on his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would go to Canberra for the morning's program on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership election, which, however, did not improve the Today's viewers.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital by Malcolm Turnbul's disbanded Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage’s creative morning program on the competing channel was sent from London, and special broadcasts of the week are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance was not important for the Australian television viewers, as Sunrise viewed an average of 397 000 viewers in the five capitals of the state, and the Today programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today's viewers rose slightly to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283,000), but remained on Thursday's (343 000).
Today has taken a trip to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, on Wednesday, there were 318 000 viewers, Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and today of 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The changes in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

According to the final triangle, Sam Wood is really the son of the Dreams, but who is the man who chooses?
Did the secret be revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of a dream bachelor.
Sam Wood's final choice has been a carefully preserved secret.
There are three remaining women who have received the last rose from the male.
We were asking about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markos and Lana Jeavos-Fellows' atmospheres before one of the three is cut off. Women could deliberately suggest who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women said Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the best partner for Wood, if the last rose didn’t hit their own spot, their response could allow them to guess who would take the heart of the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy from the beginning.
“After coming to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah has feet in the country, and he’s really having fun with the company,” Markoski added.
“I’ve seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks of herself and Sam Wood as a good couple.
Mackay said he realized last week at the home town scene that Wood might be the right one.
“When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race, and now I’m betting on our relationship full,” Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if a man did not choose him, the woman replied with appreciation:
“I can’t say,” he said.
“I like other girls as much. Snezana and Lana are flat.
The dream bachelor on the Ten channel Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for NFL-ura
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayna’s modified United States, and many other followers were also interested in the man after the last year’s impressive open training day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have liked Hayne's bench, as a man went to Australia's Rugby County team in line. Hayne made the flight kick back to the team on Tuesday to win from Minnesota by reading 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed her confidence in Hayne and gave him a new chance to return the flight.
Tomsula continued on the line after the game.
He did not rob the other team but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL-debyy.
Hayne left the field after his failure and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
“These things happen and need to move forward,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error with his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his feeding in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
The full experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old.
Hayne released a picture in Instagram, where he poses with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are discussing gay rights
In 2003, the Russian richest man, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested at a gun threat at the airport in Siberia.
The openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Hodorkovski, was condemned, the oil company Jukos, owned by the man, was removed and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead policemen in Nepal
Four people were killed in South Nepal, the government source said Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country.
On Tuesday night, violence occurred in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protestors were gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and came into the air before shooting rubber bags.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It’s not entirely clear why rubberoids, which can kill but are generally considered to be a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
It was the most recent gathering in the protests that continued for weeks on the southern shores of Nepal, where, according to the Madhes tribe, new counties based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
The protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom have been policemen, have died in violent kangaroos since August 10,
Four major political parties signed a treaty on the division of the country into the counties, a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been focused on centuries.
The new constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people died in a shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the Constitutional clauses in Katmandus this week, and the authorities believe that a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane centre: 60% probability of cyclone in the south of Cape Verde
From a wide range of lowland areas, about 560 km from the southern parts of Cape Verde Islands, 60 percent of the probability of developing tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours was announced by the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Department, there is also a clear base center in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Antillies. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it will launch a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that will help the rest of Europe’s thousands of people fleeing war and poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading the campaign, Google’s employee Rita Masoud started his own experience, and he was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
“We traveled in the dark train and by bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
A number of families in a similar situation in the wake of the European refugee and migrant crisis need help.
Donations are given to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children ry and the United Nations Refugee Organization.
After donations have been collected by google.com/refuseerelief through $5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, which will increase the total amount to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst the second world war, and the situation is exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which is why more than four million people have been forced to flee their homes this year.
The war must also be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether you live in a mildly overweight type 2 diabetics after a obesity surgery longer than those who receive surgery.
“To get the data on mortality takes time, Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
With obesity surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by various methods.
Passive methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective forms of treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have affected patients with a medical overweight (BMI) of at least 35.
The index indicates the weight and length of the weight where the normal value is 18.5-24.9.
When the weight index is over 25, the person is overweight, and the weight index of more than 30 shows significant obesity.
You can calculate your weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers in the hospital of Min-Sheng from Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and hip surgery, type 2 diabetes medications with mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index that was treated without surgery remained in the eye of 29:
Diabetes treated with surgery was completely improved by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and partly by only about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were also better in the surgery group.
The researchers also followed the haemoglobin levels of A1c in patients, which reflects the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin level of A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin value of A1c was decreased from 9 % to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Tri Chih-Cheng Hsu, which led to haemoglobin A1c, concluded that this did not reduce mortality in five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, weight loss was higher in the abdominal bypass surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight loss was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and haemoglobin levels (3.1% and 2.1%). In the safety surgery group, diabetes was completely improved in the majority (46.9% and 16.7%).
The new study was not able to show a lower mortality after five years. According to the Swedish study of Blackstone, the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, however, the surgery will bring life-years to fat people.
In a Swedish study, those obese people who had had a stomach bypass surgery, the probability of mortality decreased by 29% over the 15 years compared to the group receiving conventional treatment.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone said it was confirmed that people with a weight index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
“This is the most important discovery of the study, as it says the surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group, and it does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease,” Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
“We wait too long for people to start to take the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
“When genetic changes in the human body are accumulated that expose to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse the situation.
\"Everything can't come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in the UK. The Dalai Lama held its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the counter-reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
“The care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing, but at the same time we have to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,” Dalai Lama said.
“We must finally consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The forces have never solved problems, he added.
When talking about violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions in connection with the terrorist attacks on September 11, and claimed that when he resorted to violence in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
“After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would be made through violence.
I know that his goal was good, but he resorted to the forces that had unpredictable consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Handsome neck problems in four-fold children in four years
According to Georgia’s poisoning centre, the poisoning centers across the United States report a high concentration of alcohol in children under 12 years of age.
According to Gaylord Lopez, children under 12 years of age experienced an increase in the incidences reported to poison centres from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
“These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children will have first aid,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hands-on purpose, part to impress their friends and part of social media.
YouTube video shows teenagers who drink disinfectant due to cheap drunk.
The tea is said to be mixed with a disinfectant to make the mouth water more strong.
Smaller children can attract the smell of hands.
“The child doesn’t think the substance is bad,” Lopez said.
“Many of the attractive hand products are just scattered.
There are delicious handmade products for strawberries, grapes and orange, which appeal to children.
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45-95%.
A small amount of small children can cause alcohol poisoning.
“The alcohol content of Kasides is very high,” Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital’s Toxicity Centre, told Fox 4 channel Kansas City.
“No one would leave a child-wide vischishot, but if hand disinfecting products are often left to the reach of children, they will quickly get a high amount of alcohol.
Six-year-old Nhaijas Russell recently enjoys four loras of strawberries in the school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
“The amount of alcohol in the blood was 179, which is twice as much as the adult drink limit,” says Gwinnett Medical Center, a doctor who treated the girl near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
Nahiah was an operar, and he couldn't walk when he was brought to the first aid.
The doctors followed the girl’s room overnight in a separate kindergarten hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and beaten her head after enjoying alcohol, Ritchey said.
“Tilanne was really scary,” said Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah, who told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, in addition to the fact that the hand should be transferred to children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two of the Ontarion women died after swallowing hands that contained toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the active substance in the product was a deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been indicated as an active substance in the product information.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State designed the killing of a teacher in January, placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hands and refused to bring it to the classroom.
The police considered that the plan of the myth was meaningless and urged the most educated disciplinary action.

The Dutch need an old Scottish combat couple – de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and the Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer have found that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has stopped because they no longer get to be followed by the two-games of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands, there is no longer any mention of the highlights of Celtic games.
Because Rangers are no longer involved.
“We don’t just talk about Rangers’ return.
We're talking about Old Firm here.

“Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we’re going to get up again,” Dela said.
“We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it awakens anger or sorrow in many.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We need a lot of support from Celtic supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players.
The common spirit is really important now.
Warburton
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers-pomo Mark Warburton suggested that he should be careful with the transfer of the team and say that he wants to compromise the unity of the team.
“In January, players’ transfers differ significantly from summer transfers,” Brentford’s ex coach said.
“The players associated with the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our assembly this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes unnecessary players can cause more harm to the team than benefits.

Later today, if there is no legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of Oklahoma State, when Richard Glosssip is executed with a poison-robber.
Glosssip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I responded to the invitation.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you this about the death penalty for a real story.
The perspective would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants will be selected with a macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers from 12 to five.
The following were chosen moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man's personal relationship because we've spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can’t be present in both the characteristics of the witness and the supplier, so I can’t take the notebook and pen to make notes.
I just have to try to put the details into my mind.
One of the Oklahomaan journalists accused me of endangering impartiality on Twitter.
“The idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a pleasant way, you get close to him.
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his word more carefully, but still consider my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and wrote.
He doesn't determine what I'm writing, and even if he tries to order, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast shipment.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this connection.
I can't say Richard Glosssip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would make him guilty after the crime.
However, I think it is very likely that a man named Glosssip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can't say I'm totally neutral.
You can read the unsolicited description about other journalists.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
He was attracted to Canning River after a Russian police hunt.
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry by attracting a man up from Canning River.
An escape attempt of the perchisman bored with a low, mutate water, and a police officer who was a few meters away got the man back to the dry land.
The Canning Vale police got a call on Tuesday from an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
After reaching the place, the police found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
But the man didn't get far.
“The man standing in the water said he wouldn’t get out of the water and called on the police to get him into the water,” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia did not attract the cover of the suit, so he chose a safer tactics – a negotiation.
“In other words, an escape attempt makes people feel comfortable,” said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim on the other side of Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the pace inspired locals to plan Ben Cousins’ biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the journalists tried to blindly, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Mody accuses Racing Victoria's editors of spying business last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the editors and the Racing Victoria integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai because of the recently given treatment on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to work for racing, and he was in a difficult situation when he found a cobolt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under control from spying charges for a half year, and did not want the accusations to be influenced by bitter man's actions.
“I wasn’t going to bring it up, and I was going to throw it up for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out with a single throw,” Moody said.
“They know what really happened,” he said.
“I have to respond and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go straight, and I want the owners of the horses to think that I can do my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I would have to consider my future as a licensed coach.
Mody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told him about the insurgent spying companies in his stable.
\"A few years ago Terry Bailey, Dalele Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in a stable with the purpose of blinding my actions.
“They clearly believe I’m a scammer.
If so, they should present evidence, because I have not been caught without any promise.
The former President of RTL Robert Roulston, the current President of RTL, David Moodee, and the current CEO of RTL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider this a personal drive?
Should RTL take real action and be responsible for the situation in the sector for non-educators?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what many people think.
Maybe I'm going to become a coaching license and push me out of my duties, and I don't doubt I can think that way with my speech.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw.
The long-lasting investigation of Lidar’s cobolt values and the recent rejection situation led the coach to become frustrated in the end so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Mody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master Black Caviar. The man described the day-to-day treatment rule ridiculous after the horse's feet were against the rules.
“The care is against the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for it, Moody said.
“The person in my state mistakenly put clay on the horse’s foot.
It could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and that's what happened yesterday.
But it happened on the day of the contest.
Mody can be expected to be a three-month ban on anti-contraceptive clay treatment, which the organisers have started to resolve.
This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn’t know horses at all.
Everyone understands that the rules are needed, but this is going too far,” Moody said.
the Cobram Colary Place Arrested
The police arrested a guy who ran away from the crash site on the weekend.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he suffered serious injuries after a car crash at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled from the place, and he was not left to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, the 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to expect accusations of non-compliance with the obligation to stop and assist in traffic accidents and other traffic violations.
The 40-year-old biker from Cobram is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the opponents' buttons
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers the team to be criticizing the NRL's two leagues as a target action.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's button to the Harm of Melbourne's hosts in a race in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett covered the effort to refer to Storm Broncos, won in the Carcinthal Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, and he called the game a model match and said that Queensland would not be given a more special look.
Bellamy defended his team's tactical game and said they were just focused on contact in their tacts.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team added that the two top team coach criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as a sign that the trainers are concerned about losing to Storm.
“This thing always rises up. To remember, Trent Robinson didn’t talk about the button when his team won us from 24 to 2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defence system or technology all year.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and he could have been a shock to him, because he has a great team that hasn't gotten used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
“Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our game on Friday and considered their game interesting,” Bellamy said.
“In 2010, St Georgea received a lot of criticism from his boring game. Wayne said that the review would not stop him.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young people, with a quick central impact.
This kind of football wants to play when a player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010 now he wants everyone to play his style. Not all teams like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more self-confidence from this when other trainers are worried about my team's encounter.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of meeting us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more paintings were made in Storm and Roosevelt than in the meeting of the Bronx and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the game breaks and the least interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them.
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be visiting North Queensland Cowboys in Cronou Sharks on the next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man free for $200 on a drug case
A man waiting for a lifelong sentence in a 40-pound cocaine company in Queensland has been released for $200.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month when the police found a hundred kilos of cocaine from Solay's ship, who had come to the Vanuatu through South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maximovic and his partner in the boat port for the morning and surprised the two later at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe. The Toyota Echo car at the parking lot was found in 40 kilos of drugs.
Although Maxovicia is expecting potentially life-long drug possession for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer says there is no evidence that his boss would have tried to take over the whole batch, but the man could have been in the café for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape from the country.
“Maximovic clearly has connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, the judge said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
The mother and stepfather of Maximovic paid 200,000 guarantees together, against which the man was released.
“After reading the false evidence of both persons, it is clear that $200 is a real economic burden for them,” the judge Flanagan said.
“It’s not enough to prevent a man’s escape,” the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he would give up both his passports in Australia and Serbia, report daily to the police and stay at home from the evening to the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophili used a girl's phone to take over pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone to the girl’s sleep and logged in to an online messaging service where he allowed another user to send unauthorized images of children.
Later, when the girl woke up, she noticed the phone disappeared, and noticed it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she browsed the content of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
Five of these images were reported to the police, and after investigating the computers found on the address, the police found disruptive Internet searches that have been used to search for inappropriate children's images.
Hogg claimed that he had tried to lead pedophiles on the Internet and that he had presented the police with the aim of scaring pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, said at the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: “We claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had made the graves on the computer, but claimed that he had acted so as to present the police and thus be able to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me he got disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “After he found the messages on the phone, the girl cried out to her mother with tears and tears.
The girl saw an inappropriate picture on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She said she used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
On 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road, accused of holding unauthorized children's images last June 14 June. Hogg violated his release against guarantees on 25 January this year and left the right for consultation on 24 March this year.
Defender Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be entered into a sexual criminal record, as it could be considered that there were no significant sexual features of the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the execution of the judgment to October due to the social work background reports.
Hogg was granted an exemption against guarantees in this regard, but was held in prison for other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of execution.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest African head of state, Mugabe, fell in the steps leading to the speaker’s school earlier this year.
Mugabe did not get hurt, but the video spread rapidly in social media.
Parliament's openings also obscured the claims of opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous kill threats that warn them of bubbling Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, the Members of the People's Party dropped and suspended the President's speech on the state of the President's situation in Parliament on Tuesday.
Vice-President Innocent Gonese of the MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change) said seven opposition politicians had received text messages calling them not to interfere with Mugabe's statements.
“The video has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is “death,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside of Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
The party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings operations of the business.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will distinguish computer and printer business from faster growing business equipment and service operations.
According to HP's report, the company will book the one-time costs of $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter of the year.
“The new restructuring enables a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who leads the company after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company, and we have a large and deep portfolio of business operations that will help companies move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a single company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is over $50 billion, and the company focuses on its mission to deliver unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded in the 1930s by the Stanford University’s tumors, Bill Hewlett and Dave Paccard, is now divided into two. The two founded an electronics company in a car garage located in Palo Alto, which is now considered to be the birthplace of the Piilaxo.
HP has made massive reorganizations when traditional desktop computers are moving into mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the second largest HP in the United States are the newest transfer in the field of which it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Captain of Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb encounter
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes on a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field by December.
The best scenario means that Wilshere will have to miss at least the next four English national teams. The man's history, knowing his participation in the European Championships, is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble of the last problem is that Wilshere decided the last season strongly after the more snoring and seemed to return to his former blade under a new season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten a career,” Wenger said.
“The body didn’t get well.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries.
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
Here too, there is an unpleasant need for regulation.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal lines only 65 out of 157 leagues over the last five years.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that from the period 2007-2008, six out of eight teams have been the second most affected by the lost teams.
Wenger accepts the potential witch gang, but Arsenal believes, the improved injury statistics in the past period continue to evolve in a better direction.
“The ability to return after injury can be associated with a vulnerable period of time, when the body needs to be strengthened and competition powers sought,” Wenger said.
Jack's young, so he's gonna make it.
I hope that he will balance his body. I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves.
The Arsenal will start his career in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger prepares for small changes in the assembly.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put in the initial composition to replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to take care of the team’s balance and give rest to those who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F Group’s successor, Maximir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games.
The stadium was nourished on Tuesday night, when the earth was hit by a force of 3.2 at Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the past season after having to bend to Monaco, and that he is still motivated by a distant desire to create a team towards the European Championship.
“We have a huge energy charge,” Wenger said.
“I haven’t hit this title yet.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, with experience, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths of friendship between men
A similar description shines out of his absence in other series. It is remarkable, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide statistics for young men are at the highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 15 years in the UK, and suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) takes the problem by declaring the 2015 men’s year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In the recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, healing opportunities for people suffering from depression symptoms are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the probability of developing unoptimized people was halved if there were people in their vicinity who had no mental health problems.
But everything is based on friendship.
Modern communication dominates social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than relevant contacts.
With the digitalization of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, although isolation is reality.
The values, money, image, and social status associated with superficial success. These all take into account internal values and natural personal growth and friendship. Internal values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money can’t actually buy happiness.
The fineness of the Fredie was that the series turned its focus on the main surface.
None of the characters in the series were defined by the profession but by the personality. This appeared in friendship relationships.
The series was humoristly presented by Joey and Chandler to hug or watch football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often looking for Rachel. It was clear that men were able to identify this, even though they were not holding the feeling of being full.
A volunteer explained this to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and suicidal, I have become aware of how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to do is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems.
“Fndret is one of the books that present long-term survival mechanisms.
The small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from outside the desperate moment, but long-term support can be obtained from a close circle of friends and families.
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the series's stage has been awakened to live. So if you attend the event this weekend, it is worth taking your friends to a coffee in Central Perki.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship relationship can get out of it.
Comedy Central sends the entire Fredit series – all 236 episodes – for #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmön
Angel Di Maria celebrates a goal with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Champions' league and helped PSG to hit the Swedish team on Malmö Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the league of Champions by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game was played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French masters immediately in the hands of her hands. However, the PSG will push several goals before they finally could add their lead: Cavani was painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against Sweden’s master. PSG is not only seeking a follow-up in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its positions for a quarter of the remaining three matches.
Although the SPG picked up points, the match was not the perfect performance of the Laurent Blanc piloted team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal-making site, and the man had been replaced when he was in charge of his former home club, where the man began his great career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the league of the masters at home or at guests, so a 2-0 win and good bets give us a good base, even though we still have to be disappointed for the season,” Blanc said.
This is good.
We were able to make a profit, and we were able to do so.
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after his injury. The team had to be satisfied with the 2-2 game in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, Manchester United, a Argentinan machine moved to the PSG lines, was named as a PSG solver, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the title when he praised Marco Verrattt for the ball's impact on Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate hit on the back corner of the goal, along with Johan Wiland.
However, those waiting for the PSG’s crushing win had to be disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic's fall games, marched to the field nine international players from the start. The team with five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot went a little past Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game for 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
On the other hand, the PSG was in vain for feeding and weak finishing, not the least Ibrahimovic, which lost five destinations in the first half of the year. In the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick was fed to the potatoes by Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the feeding game. From Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria shot a spiral kick in the next 52 minutes to Wiland.
The second goal was born at the time of the Cavani, with the help of the co-founder Cavani. The Mexicans who played with him shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him with the kick of the left garnisher Maxwell.
Malmö's book ended in another goal, and only Wiland's top defense from David Luz's near distance to shoot the shot was kept in the loop, and the Ezequiel Lavez painting from the exchange bench was abandoned at the end of the field.
Malmö trusted Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in his own class. “We ate the previous Champions League game last December.
After that, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Carnations are not enough.
A hat for couples.
This was a top match for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock
The Swiss miner Glencore, which was tested by the prices of raw materials, collected $2.5 billion in the stock of the average week as part of his debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in his statement that he sold new shares in order to reduce debts of about 1.6 billion pounds.
The company’s market value fell by 57 per cent this year, and the company climbs with the drop in the price of raw materials when the recession in the Chinese economy hampers demand and burdenes the market.
With the stock exchange, Glencore’s share price was the beginning of the morning on the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 per cent increase.
Glencore announced last week that he was planning to raise $2.5 billion as part of a strategy to reduce his debt of $30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 pence prices, which account for 2.4 per cent of the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a value of up to 9,99% of the total group.
The concern of the continuation of the recession in the Chinese economy has led to the collapse of the price of iron ore, while the fall of coal, copper and other commodities has been 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
The White House Communication on Tuesday confirms that China’s President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive at Washington's first official visit on 25 September. It is a counter-responsive visit from President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
After the bilateral discussions of the Heads of State, the President of the United States and his wife, Michelle Obama, organises dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in honor of the state visit.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit enables the expansion of cooperation between the United States and China in a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics interested in both sides. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity for constructive discussions on topics that are different,” said the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping’s visit was first announced in February, and is expected to take place in Seattle, meeting with several U.S. tech leaders. From Seattle, the president’s journey would continue first to Washington and to New York at the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to highlight a number of controversial issues, such as Washington’s concern for Chinese alleged cyber-vaccupation and the increased efforts of the country in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a hard conversation with African American Effie Brown and said that the diversity was not needed behind the camera.
In the series of HBO Project Greenlight presented on Sunday evening, Brown was interrupted by an experienced actor when he explained how important it was to take into account the different views of the project in the case of the dark person in the script chosen for the project.
“Moninity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program,” Damon said.
Brown fell short and injured. “Woe, clear, she said, after a comment by Damon, who starred the film on Mars alone.
Damon and Brown had met with other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
“Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to consider how Harmony’s character is presented,” Brown said.
“The only dark character is a prostitute who has sex with his white couple.
The producer of the Dear White People film supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancacchio as director of the film. Damon said that the choice of the twin could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the debate was presented on television, social media exploded from Damon's nasty comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger about the scene in direct words: “The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark person to explain what diversity is is is so whiteish that he is doing pain.
The tradition was shared more than 5,000 times and it was loved 4 000 times.
Damon’s comments are a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is one-to-one.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, died of a White Police pilot in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement received support from the country. The movement sought to stop the discriminatory treatment of lawmakers and authorities.
In February, the singer Prince introduced the album candidates for the year in Grammy Gaala.
“Albumme still matters,” he said.
“As with books and dark people’s lives, albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Live Matter movement published an opinion in response to the question of How News Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether this group should be described as a hate group.
“Black Live Matter is a group based on love,” the head of the movement said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and mediamogules invited to talk to the Pope about the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown if Damon answered the invitation.
American Ninja Warrior
I was the first American Ninja Warrior on Monday, and you gave me a million dollars to win.
For the first time in the seventh period of the TV series, all assigned tasks were examined.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last mission, men had to suffer from a 23-meter rope up to 30 seconds.
Britten explained the task in the first given time. He was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race. Caldiero, however, completed the task three seconds faster and rose to the winner.
Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after he hit a million dollars of pot.
“The winning amount is incredible, because I never earned more than $100,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E! about his winnings.
“I can’t even imagine what’s next, the future is just open.
The producer Kent Weed spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten was not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to solve all the tasks.
According to the rules, the fastest to win prizes.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest wins, Weed explained.
“The prize is wonderful and revolutionizes life, but the British will also be satisfied.
I don't think he's gonna miss it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from fans.
Britten is a great guy whose family is important.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win, he would rather play the victory for Isaac.
