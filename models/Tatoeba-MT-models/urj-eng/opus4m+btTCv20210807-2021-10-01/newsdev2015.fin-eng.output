Changes to corporate support practices - Province - Regions - News - Karelian
In addition to EU business support, the management of national corporate subsidies will be concentrated on four centres from mid-September to mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savon Ely Centre is responsible for action in Mikkel.
According to the new corporate support law, EU Structural Funds should no longer be targeted at large enterprises if it is not entirely new activities.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be a great honour.
Instead, EU aid can continue to be granted for investments improving the conditions of the business of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national aid management unit will be a force of around 30 people.
At least until now, they all continue to work at their current locations.
For example, the job of the Head of the Structural Funds Department of the South Savo Ely Centre, Kalev Pöösen, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine.
Russia works consistently, even if it doesn’t always seem that way.
The Head of the Department of Strategy for the Defence College, Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the conflicting Ukraine news of the Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine tells us that its landing forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations should create an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and must immediately obtain the outcome of the negotiations in order to establish their position in Luhanski and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: we urgently need to negotiate and specifically so that Russia gets its own take to the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair externalizes passenger services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair starts buying passenger services as a sub-contract from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will first apply to Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but it will be extended later.
The appearance of two routes in Finland leads to a total reduction of about one hundred years of personal work in Finland, which is carried out in the first stage by holiday trips, the company said in its publication.
In addition, the work of around 80 Asian rental workers will end at the time the routes will be externalized.
Finnair already announced in June that it intends to outsource some 20 routes in the next two years.
The externalities ended when no savings were made with the staff.
The aim is to start the next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will continue with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. stroke pain, for those who work hard.
In the study of the occupational health department, firefighters were monitored for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the shockwood is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firemen, which are tested regularly, does not seem to be protective of pain, says the research director, Doctor Sirpa Lusa, in the Health Department.
Firefighters’ work is an irregular shift where the shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health department, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the unexpected new causes of water damage?
It is easy to destroy other apartments.
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by a leaking tube or hana, reminds the host association expert.
We have been contacted when the infringement of the aquarium has caused a water damage in the house company that if the aquariums can be banned, Marina Furhjelm, a law expert in the Association of Hostings, tells us.
Furuhjelm recalls that only pipes and drains are not the general causes of water damage, but also today more and more new machines such as ice-burners have caused water leaks in apartments.
Many people do not know that machines such as dishwashers or washing machines should not be left uncontrollable.
The water must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe can lead to a water leak.
A resident may be considered guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the person has liability for the damage.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the conditions of insurance and the case.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused negligence, the person is responsible for the liability.
If the resident has turned off the shower on the floor well, the neglect can often be proved as, in these cases, the water has flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the abandoned resident is found.
Furuhjelm says that due to the generalization of the deflection of floor mines, two floor mines have now been installed in the shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by water sands, although no longer to the extent that they were more popular.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of the home wine can become real water damage.
I also know the case in which there were many cats in the apartment that had peeed on the floors so that there were large damages, Furuhjelm said.
The principle of responsibly always goes the same way if the company does not order otherwise in the corporate order.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and the damage to the structure of the house company and the damage to other apartments.
Water damage can easily cause destruction in other apartments, as the structure of concrete absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhjelm, the house’s cartridge leaks are particularly difficult, because the batteries are easily leaked into secret glass structures.
Water damage can now be caused by common air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a solid sewage or a rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and rubbish from the balcony, the law expert advises.
Furuhjelm advises that, although the rules of the housekeeper do not require, for example, a permanent removal of the washing machine, the insurance may be a condition for which the compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policies.
However, I consider washing machines to be loose, for example, as a major risk to water removal pipes that have caused many damage.
I recommend that the removal doors always be permanently connected to the sewage pipeline.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Control of the washing machine, the washing machine, etc. machines, while they are on.
Closure of water wells (washing machine and dishwasher)
Flooring is visible twice a year.
The recommendation is to connect the removal doors to the drain permanently.
Check the straps and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have experience in water damage?

FC Honka lost again and lit into a serial jumbo
At the Tapiola sports park, two of the most vulnerable teams of the football Sniper's gym today.
In June, FC Honka hosted seven games in an invincible pipeline of Vaasa Palloseura.
VPS just won Honka in July.
Sunday’s encounter with the Espoola team came to a good sauna, as the VPS returned to the winning channel for a long time, with a maximum of 2-1.
Olli Huttunen, the main coach of the people, complained before his team was ineffective, but the mixed Honka defense made it easier for VPS to paint problems.
Playfully very nervous about doing it.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we didn't get to hold the ball, Huttunen estimates his own performance.
In the first half of the season, the Hongan Top of Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played a very uncertain game.
Both were born as a result of the loose play of the rappers.
Only after five minutes of the match was seen when Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's shot by the dazzling Honka painter Walter Viella.
It's a rough first half.
By the field, the team did the opposite of the match before the game, Hongan chief coach Shefki Kuqi mani.
After the start of the crash, the Espoleans got their game together and ran the ball at the attack.
Especially the midfield player Carlos Portela and the batter Roni Porokara were eager to find places to do, but the last solutions were almost repeated.
The closest painting was the Hongan Central Fieldman Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot, however, was slightly over the VPS paint.
VPS hit effectively by utilizing its vicqueous attackers and Honga's confusing topparians.
At half an hour, the raspberries made a 2-0 ostum, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached a passage between them.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was at the start of the opening season and repeatedly created situations from the left.
The speed of Stewart seemed to be too much of an espolistic defense throughout the game.
“In six semesters, if you lose, then you will be lost with honor,” Kuqi said.
In the second episode, Honka sought a gruelling paint.
The team was twice close until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa completed the goal in the middle of the punishment area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to fight.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity for dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey once got up with the Witch, but the backdrops of the Honka painter kept the home team involved in the game.
At the end of the day, Honka leaned a little and did not get any more land.
With the match, Honka poured the Veikkaluslig last while there are seven more matches left.
The press: Putin threatened to capture Kiev in two weeks.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was a very hard-to-use telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, says the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his enthusiasm for the plans of the European Union to tighten the sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take the Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin’s message to Barroso was this: I do not want to irritate Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian television channel an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in the interview that he considered the conflict completely internalized in Ukraine and urged the government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiova very much about the fire of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia can't watch next door, if people are shot to death from the nearby distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits: The actor’s work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Konkarist and the theatre show raised the recognition of how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actress Esko Roine is 70 years old next Friday, but I think he has a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don’t see any difference compared to two years ago or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty appears to be continuing, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but still he's pushing for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre exhibition How to succeed in business life, the Tampere Workers' Theater, and the Tampere Comedy Theatre Quartet.
Roine is also seen in the upcoming Risto Rapper film.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't have to go to school to see a teenage movie.
40-50 years later, the teacher said I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't get bored.
The choice of the career was clear, there were no alternatives.
It felt close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left the school and, as a volunteer, went to the army just to get to work in theatre school as quickly as possible.
Roine has made about 200 theatre roles and 300 tv-shows a little depending on how to calculate.
If the work is calculated like Engelsmants, every part of the TV series is its own show, then the TV stories are more than 600.
I was three years in a new day that was made three episodes a week.
In the other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full hit and make the Tampere Workers' Theatre Still time to see the charming roles of anarchist Muslims.
My little brother's going on the stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to take a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
There are reservations in Calendar for autumn 2016.
They've left a man behind for years.
Age won't be alone.
The knees are operated, the hips are hinting, and the joint is troubled, but when you don't let it too much bother, yes, with these, Esko Roine says.
The Tv-General Roine became familiar, for example.
About the pirate radio and some throw, where he shared hundreds with Antti Einio, hundreds of notes.
It was Antti Einio, which divided hundreds.
I tried to say they were rainy and not rainy.
In the reinikainen series, Roine was a futile Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of policemen in Tampere, when he happened to be the same commander in the morning.
Some policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me that “the Iron Rock is great.”
Working Group Successful
The theatre works have remained in the mind of Roine, for example.
The City Theatre Producer and Master class of Helsinki, the death of the Tampere Workers' Theatre Business Traveler and the long day trip of Tampere Theatre to the night.
Everything is related to the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's my team.
There have also been rituals.
The role of Pekka Woodhead in the film is one of them.
There are others.
The reason is that I have agreed too easily.
I don’t know if I’m going to regret those roles, but the outcome is not myself and the viewers are not satisfied.
As a matchmaker, you can't choose your own job.
It's just kind of done what's been told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 1980s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
There was nothing about it when I tried to be the director, actor, and then the restaurant owner at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year I found out that they should not be matched.
It was typical that when the show was finished or in the meantime and I had time to think about whether I would put on the sauna, the restaurant became a call that you have friends who wish to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On the day of his birth, Esko Roine shows memories of Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of matureness they've made from the memory images of the face-lifter.
In Zoom, when I played, I was said to be a face-to-face culprit.
They didn't know me.
The book has been made for years.
At the time, Roine told me that no news bomb is allowed, because he hasn't done anything so rough, or if he is, he won't tell me.
I made a small introductory statement in the book.
I say that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, stop reading this.
There's a lot of work involved, as an actor when he's a theatre director.
The publisher also says that there is a tourist from an unsuspecting theatre school.
It was a fairly normal student life, but the kakara made all-looking tricks.
It wasn't as bad as it was at the time of Turkey.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much more than self-confident that when the school has gone, I don’t know that it’s at least not closed if the works don’t heal.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siims, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen, and I got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law Kaarlo Death.
With Pia Hattara, we had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was on the same course with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukkaka Halttusen.
As a painful matter, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that the daughter went to my mother and son to me.
I did not think it to be a good solution, and in my view, children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It’s not uncommon in theatre circles to share silver.
In our case, some part of it was that I did a lot of work at the time.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and a family life suffered.
On the day of the party, maybe at night.
Esko Roine celebrates the Tampere Workers Theatre on September 7th.
The festival will continue at Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
I'm sure that's where you're going.
I was working 50 and working sixty years.
When it happened to such an easy-to-move play, I thought that it would be now held in the age of seventy, so it would be taken off on one rhythm.
According to Roine, there are no holidays on the actual birthday.
I remember it's free, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have failed some gig for that day.
Or maybe it's a strange holiday I'm going to keep on the night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the UK’s smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the supply chain’s manufacturing capacity problems may be hampered by the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the production chain of aircraft are currently enjoying an unexpected amount of aircraft and engine development plans at the same time.
Aviation and Defence
While some enjoy the order gap, the capacity problems in the production chain and the price pressure have been warned.
“It is quite true that the price pressure exists, especially now that the production volume poses challenges,” says Craig Gallagher, director of MB Aerospace, the major suppliers of the aircraft manufacturers like Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing about 240 North West Aerospace Suppliers in North England, needs more capacity.
Are strategies and investment plans for these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need to increase our investment in new production equipment and machinery needed to achieve these production volumes, Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft buildings are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Chrurchill, who produced the wings of gas-fueled manufacturers, the company has a “surprising time” when several new building plans began to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
In the eye, we moved from very small production to a state where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and in addition, we had to try to move on.
However, it is useless to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans, Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800 000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
A number of actors in the industry believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers will be needed if the UK wants to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
Ford Aerospace’s President and Tyneside fine mechanic Geoff Ford says that order smoke should increase the confidence of producers and desire to expand and increase production capacity, as work must be challenged.
“If this doesn’t happen, we will lose our race against other countries,” says Ford.
Some large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250-based aircraft and engine-making company, Senior, bought parts of the aircraft in Malaysia with 75 million pounds of UPECA.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
“It’s possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in reality, the most production slows down the limitations of design and the number of engineers,” said Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has moved from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engines manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN aircraft manufacturing unit, also acts as a representative of the UK aircraft trade, is of the opinion that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There are pressures in the supply chain, but I would not consider the situation critical.
“There is more importance for introducing new technologies and advanced processes,” Bryson said.
Both Airbus and Boeing have taken mistakes to learn and are now more cautious so that the building volumes are not added too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it was faced with major difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Director of the Rolls Royce aircraft manufacturing unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18,000 parts of the jet engine to manufacture the engine.
“It will certainly be a pitfall, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and by contacting the suppliers when they are prepared to increase their activity,” Wood said.
According to Boeing’s CEO James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus passenger jets, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines in a month by 2018.
“Some of the journalists may not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation and support journalists and look for options, but there are big problems,” Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for sin-frees: “The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
This is my job as well as Airbus.
Hong Kong protest groups begin the “time period of inviolability of the people – in Beijing, when the open elections are banned
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
The activists supporting democracy spread to Hong Kong streets after China rejects the requirements for their open elections.
The groups in favour of Hong Kong's democracy emphasize that demonstrations can stamp and swear to ensure that the period of inviolability in the city begins - to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protesters threatened the rain of Hong Kong’s hovering horizon when they traveled to the Occupy Central Group to organize a demonstration in front of the Council’s premises responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night. There the protestors invited people to participate in a wide-ranging sitting demonstration to Laminate the city’s financial card.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would prohibit voters' right to propose candidates in public elections in 2017, threatening the demonstrations that took place this month, which will further increase the city’s chasm.
The protests of the Occupy Central movement are taking place in front of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
“We want fair and decent elections,” said Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website manager, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of Hong Kong.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of Hong Kong.
The Chinese People's Congress approved plans for electoral change, which allowed only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the nomination is required for the approval of the 1200-person Nomination Committee and, in the view of opposition politicians, this prevents the access of the presenter of political views to the electoral flags effectively.
In addition to the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, the protesters will participate in a state-of-the-art demonstration that was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
According to the police, more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the state of mind.
A large number of policemen followed when some 100 protesters led by the Scholarism Student Group gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, a member of the Communist Party, was supposed to stay in Beijing after his arrival.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
Or, in order to comply with the law, the exact date in which the blockage of roads was carried out, but the participants urged the participants to follow closely the development of the situation in the next couple of weeks, adding that the city would be officially transferred to the period of non-citizenity.
Benny or she will answer the questions of the press.
“Look at the person next to you,” he said in a Sunday demonstration in front of the advertising board representing two characters of disobedience in China.
That man's power over the center with you!
The 17-year-old gathering of Scolarism, Joshua Wong, said earlier that preparations for high school students' demonstrations are underway and designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their mind by refusing teaching.
“In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility,” Wong said.
In Beijing, the Vice-President of the Committee on the Congress of Nations Li Fei told reporters that defending the “international requirements” of the general right of vote is “timeless” and from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to “coordinate society and lead it into error.
“The unconventional proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time,” Li says, demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way that it is suitable for the real situation and the legislative framework of each society.
The general right of vote can only be accepted as a law if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong’s 70-year legislative body, supports it, which means that 27 opposition members can stop the initiative.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong could be involved in a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected as a veto.
“It would damage business and city development,” he said.
Nearly 800 000 people voted in an informal poll organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose the Chinese requirements. According to demands, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the march on 17 August against Beijing and Opcupy Central was attracted by some 88,000 participants. The figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured lightning attacks at the New York Beach
In a flash attack on a beach in New York, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured at the Orchard Beach beach at Pelham Bay on Sunday night when the storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of injuries is unknown.
The lightning hit when the heavy thunderstorms wipe over the city.
The storm rains, the thunderstorms, and the lightning stopped the celebration of Labor Day and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens, and forced the music festival to close in the early East River island.
Tens of commercial flights arriving at the city airports were late due to bad weather.
The new idea is not to please
This is the latest guide for employees and managers of network users, and it is shared by author Harvey Schachter of the Monday Morning Manager.
According to the entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea of such comments as “I don’t like it,” or “I don’t understand.”
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – so boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so low that it is not worth it.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people wouldn’t think he had anything new to offer.
Now, as a rector of the University, he repeats the same thing several times, so that the message goes widely.
In the opinion of the advertising consultant Bob Hoffman, TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more are reading news about the network does not mean that the internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that there is enough word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they were critical of the cooperation of the problem, although in fact they worked alone in the empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than the participants who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between two units, the performance expert Dave Paradise advises to forget about Microsoft’s SmartArt and instead use the Diagrammer.com program where you can choose 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital’s catholic surgery in the prohibition of safety risk
The specialist has temporarily resigned, and the UK national health system NHS ceased to direct patients to any hospital in question after the hospital problems occurred.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said it was connected to 19 patients in the treatment of 26 July and invited them to “sacrifice clinical research.”
The Mount Stuart Hospital was sorry about the matter and said it was started to be examined after the doctor had resigned.
The case came to Torbay's hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart had applied for its first aid due to eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day had a need for repair surgery.
The Torbay hospital and the medical district of South Devon and Torbay have not been directed by patients after the problems with Mount Stuart have occurred.
David Sinclair, a temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, said that “we have identified the problem in the early stages and we have been able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to the service provider, we carry out quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest regulatory requirements and that its licenses are in good condition.
According to Gill Gant, the patient safety officer responsible for the patient safety of the South Devon and Torbay hospital district, the patient safety is always an absolute number one, so it is important not to carry out such surgery until we can be completely sure that the treatment is safe.
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, asked “excessively sorry for all patients with complications.”
The company was informed that, when we were able to find out about the problem, we and later the Torbay Hospital were called to all the patients in question.
This specialist has been licensed for the treatment of Ramsay Health Care company since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has completed 4 537 ophthalmic surgery in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he has performed have been excellent and the complication rate has been less than 0.5 %.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has temporarily resigned until the matter has been studied.
What is “4chan”
Anonymous Newspaper was first released by famous naked images.
What exactly is ‘4chan’, and why was it the first option of the hacker when he published stolen images?
“4chan” was founded in 2003. It has raised a communication site that is as much as it is praised.
The site is divided into several parts, so called notification boards where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create one, continuously used profile, and their publications are not retained.
On the most popular reporting boards, comments may be lost less than a minute when the latest publications remove them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere.
The members of the anonymous community have created some of the most famous memoirs of the network (such as \"rickrolling\" and \"lolcats\", but the lack of the rules of the site has also led to a lot of question or even criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification board on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly displayed in the NSFW content (NOt Safe For Work).
This may include summer porn, but also rough and shocking pictures. The anonymous hacker published the published stolen images on this notice board on the weekend.
CytRx invests in cancer research and development
The aim of CytRx is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company producing biological drugs in Los Angeles, a company that had a short time ago to target a lot of drug research and development of cancer drugs, led to the sale of shares.
The most promising drug is aldocsorubin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials in treating aldoxorubic soft tissue carcinoma, capos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours associated with AIDS.
It’s like a controlled missile that runs directly into a tumor and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsman’s CEO of CytRx’s cancer medicine aldocsorubis.
Aldocsorubis contains so-called unified technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates into tumors, when the drug passes directly into cancer cells.
The compound only gives up the drug in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
With this technology, the patient can be given cancer medicine at more and more doses.
“It’s like a missile that runs directly into the tumor and not other bodies,” says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus raised $86 million for maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a crucial phase 3 clinical trial for soft tissue sarcoma alternative treatment.
Soft tissue is a kind of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative treatment is used in the treatment of cancer when the initial treatment does not result in results.
If clinical research is successful, CytRx plans to apply for permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The drug could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published in December from the previous clinical trial of CytRx showed that aldocsorubin is a promising treatment for soft tissue cancer.
“We’ve seen clinical information about how much it’s different from the drug itself,” says Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of results confirmed many opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial, as it is significantly different from the previous study, which produced good results.
“How many things to go right,” he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
“First, we invest a lot of money to find that one gold coin, and the investment continues to be so long that the gold vessel will be found,” he said.
Money is spent on research and development so long that the drug is commercialized.
Many shareholders have demanded CytRx to court because they believe it gave a better picture of their success.
The company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group company who then claimed that it hired people to write positive comments on CytRx company and on another biotechnology company published in articles like Forbes, Seeing Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaint, the articles did not reveal that companies paid commissions to authors.
As a result of the news, Seeing Alpha announced that he had removed the articles, “who were against practice.”
A number of articles were also removed from other websites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the complaints.
“I don’t have time and energy to focus on this,” Kriegsman said.
According to him, CytRx’s real challenge is to find talented workers who tend to work at centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston in the field of biotechnology.
“This is in many ways a wilderness from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry,” he said.
Analyst
The price of CytRx shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then dropped to less than $3 in April when the allegations of advertising the shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, claims and negative disclosures have reduced the price of shares as their actual value.
“It’s regrettable,” Fein says, “but I’m not sure if there’s any easy way to bypass this matter as long as the concept is in force.
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of a description.
The real event-based, in the name of the Lai series, in Finland, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman described the shooting between a private police party and a person suspected of armed robbery at the fast food restaurant when he was hit by a bullet.
He died quickly of the injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ website, a person suspected of armed robbery was killed in a shooting incident, in addition to a cameraman.
The first series of real-tv programmes in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The issue of an outside factor will play a crucial role in dealing with Ulvila’s death today.
Anneli Aueria is accused of murdering her husband, Jukka S. Lahti, in 2006.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa now deals with the case for the second time since the Supreme Court restored its right to fly with a new piece of evidence.
The purpose of the court is that the judgment will still be given on the side of this year.
The court of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
The court then considered the possibility of an external factor to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, Kelle Kulmala told the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and of the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether an outsider who has killed Jukka Lahti Anneli Auer in a way and in time.
It's Anneli Auer's report on the credibility of the story, Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, he began a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti was held from Auer and tried to prevent this from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife, Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several facts prove that there was no external factor.
For example, the emergency call is not a voice from an external factor.
The oldest child of Auer, the daughter of the daughter, told the interview that he saw the author when the man left the garage door.
The release of the court judgment of Vaasa in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the daughter’s observation cannot be correct.
“The girl didn’t see an outsider in the parents’ bedroom, even though she was there twice watching,” Kulmala said.
The new witness of the prosecutor is related to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told me about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to a woman, her daughter in the hospital only told me that she saw Lahti's body when she was at the scene of death in the fireplace room.
Auer's defense plans to introduce legal investigation lines that the police have not adequately investigated.
When Vaasa’s court court released him three years ago from Auer’s accusation, the right was to find a foreign man’s dna as one of the outside factors.
The exhibition later proved to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
It was then taken as a massage sample from 700 people.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded,” Juha Manner said.
Another of the new witnesses of the defense tells us about the possible outsider.
The Ulvilian told the police about a Portuguese man who had recognized the act according to a woman's statement.
The police questioned the man in the summer.
The prosecutor made a decision that the Portuguese man had nothing to do with the crime.
The woman's prosecutor made a request for an investigation, as the prosecutor suspects that she lied to her report.
Another of the new witnesses of the defence is a nurse who was at work at the Satakun Central Hospital on the night of his death.
In December last year, Auer condemned the death penalty for his life sentence.
According to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, outside the possibility of the author was fought by reports of the children of Auer, the noises of the outside factor missing from the emergency centre and the time required for the costs of the events.
The sentence came in 2-1.
The judge who remained in the minority wrote that the evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as the benefit of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s report must be interpreted as meaning that despite the contradictions in the report, this had found an outside factor leaving the door of the fireplace room.
The two oldest children of Auner have been invited to hear the court law.
The girl was first heard personally last year in the Supreme Court of Satakunta.
In court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
The second oldest child named his mother a killer in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the murder night behind the closed door.
He also said Auer planned to kill for six months.
The son has no obligation to speak in court.
The court proceedings continue today with Anneli Auer’s consultation.
The hearing will continue tomorrow if necessary.
Anneli Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years of sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20?
Putin’s actions in Ukraine have made him a lot of top-ranking people.
Putin is supposed to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is eagerly discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock activist group, Pussy Riot, called on Australia to ban Putin’s participation in the summit with more than 4,000 representatives from the world’s most influential states.
“We don’t think this person has anything to do with the G20,” said Maria Alyokhina at Sydney’s full-fledged opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is “the perfect war on the shore,” and Putin calls parts of Ukraine, “Novorossia,” i.e. “the new Russia,” so we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbottt said, \"to make a decision,\"
According to Mike Callaghan, head of the Lowy Institute’s G20 unit, the Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even though the meeting is held in the country.
“Australia can decide who to let it go, but it’s an international meeting,” he said.
Just as New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted meetings of the International Monetary Fund, “the father’s task is not to deny any of the invited visits,” said Callaghan.
Last week, Tony Abbott said he was going to make a decision – after the horrific actions of Russia in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is becoming a very significant international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on it alone.
“But this is an important thing that I’m going to weigh a lot, and I think that’s what other countries will do next week,” he said.
People will participate in an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, East Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest emerging economies, with a total of about two-thirds of the world's people living and accounting for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from countries not members of the G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had the task of balancing the various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister’s best way to handle this is to use the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent activities.
“The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions.
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to report his activities,” Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
Russian rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk Airport for an attack on the Ukrainian military bases in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend the Puti meeting, and Callaghan said this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
This must be the last thing in Putin's mind.
“I need to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November,” he said.
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, reacts to Putin's arrival in Australia, especially with reservations, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the prime ministers and foreign ministers to discuss with other states and G20s whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand it.
After the tragic events in Malaysia's Airlines, both in the absence of the proper cooperation of the weather, the sense of responsibility and the accident, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the Ukrainian border, I think that most Australians are very early to welcome Putin.
Germany’s business world criticises the “creating” – Berlin
Some of Germany’s top business leaders warn that Germany has become ‘very confident and independent’, as government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the country’s currency.
The criticism of Mrs Angela Merkel's government is happening at the same time as Europe's largest economy seems to be a sign of a slowdown, causing concern about whether it is able to run economic growth in the euro area in its place.
The criticism of business managers is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector from political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wages and the reduction of the pension age of certain long-term workers for 63 years.
“I think the biggest threat right now is too much trust in Germany, which inevitably creates a sense of self-rivalment,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world’s largest chemical manufacturer BASF.
EU economy
“In general, we feel that we are working well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level.
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government policy shows that we are not focused on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but instead we focus significantly more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain people.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the BDI in Germany, “The situation in Germany is good now.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy will need to change. ...[Germany] The reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce has also expressed criticism about recent political developments.
German unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even though the already slowed consumption is growing again.
However, the second quarter of GDP has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2% in the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany’s weakened performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against inflation more difficult and may make it more likely to recover from quantitative recovery.
Kerber would like the government to move back from public consumption to public investment, for example by focusing on future consumption on infrastructure and not on pensions.
Kerber believes that Merkel’s government will destroy the fruit of his social democracy predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in the early 2000s.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, the Executive Director of the Stiftung Familienunternenhmen Foundation, established for family companies, says: “The situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is a thank-you to companies and not to government politics. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The French example in the neighbourhood has shown that the use of money for social support and the restriction of the freedom to manage a company is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation in a more direct way, saying that recent decisions by the government are a disaster.
Germany threatens to lose everything it has done so much to please voters.
This is my main concern right now, the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused the industry to be competitive.
Ashton Kutcher handsomes music festivals, with an obstacle to security guards' access to the fan
Actress Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach concert festival in India, California, where he was told to have been involved with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is told about the fight with the security officer at the cartoon festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him with a backstage at the Stagecoach chamber music festivals in California, after which the situation was robbed of his hands, theTMZ website says.
Kutcher was in VIPs when a young woman approached him to greet and hand him over.
When the star of the male series went to greet the fan, the super-inspiring securityman went in between and caused the nun.
The actress and security officer drove into a handwreck, and Kutcher's friends had to go in between to arrest Kutcher, TMZ says.
After his ex-wife, Demi Moore Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, a star of the former 70s show like Kutcher.
The Nujakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the standard screen screen after he published a video calling the series “bad,” and urges the fans not to look at it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher participates in Stagecoach Music Festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, “Jake,” calls the series “bad,” and invites people not to look at it.
The Baltic Sea Bacteria killed a vacationer
The bacteria that come from the Caribbean, the popular German tourist destination, have been infected by six people.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is seen in parts of the Baltic Sea and in other parts of the world, but it is most likely found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in breaking water at more than 20 degrees.
“The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct, Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS), told The Local magazine.
The bacteria are equally located in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the disease had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrenshopa with a small wound on his feet.
The sick man went to the hospital after he noticed that his leg had become blue.
Doctors reported blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnicus bacteria on foot.
“My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea area if he had known about the danger,” Sonja Bruehl told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious disease and the damage to the patient and their family could have been avoided if the information had been better served. For example, the animal target could have been made known.
LAGuS told the Dpa News Agency that doctors have been invited to the next infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have led to lower risk of bacterial disease.
“[Maantain] test results showed that V. vulnificus’ strain has significantly decreased,” says Dr. Will.
Cool weather has been done.
Vibrio vulnificus, a family of collating bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and impaired immune response such as HIV or diabetes and elderly people.
The risk of getting sick is greater than that of women, as estrogen is found to be protective of pathogens.
If the bacteria get sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The probability of loss of the disease is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating its contaminated marine animals, although Dr. Will said in these cases this is not contagious.
The pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern half of the ball.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning last time in 2010, when two people died.
Vino Kekkonen: Breast was removed due to cancer suspicion
The 80-year-old singer Vino Kekkonen is playing and practicing hard, but has also been afraid of his health.
It’s amazing that the radiant Vino Kekkonen has been filling up for 80 years.
He has also been amazed at how many of these years can suddenly be.
I didn't realize I was this old.
For 80 years, it sounds like a lot, Vino Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vino Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, he was given a birthday party by a folk music and pension association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola stage, in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was ashamed of the celebration, the birthday hero tells me about the occasion where the stage measured for three hundred was filled with congratulations.
A few days later, Armi Kuusela was gathered together, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers to be followed by a young man.
And now we're both of this age!
Vino Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only few aspects that have not been seen in public in Vino Kekkonen.
One thing he has never said in public before: 2006 he was removed from another breast.
My breast was an unclear finding at a point where it was decided to be completely removed.
It was not a cancer, of course, which I was happy about.
In the same surgery, a new breast was made, so it was a very large measure.
Viino Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a way in vain, as knowledge of the unclear discovery would have been a heavy strain and could not be neglected.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vino Kekkonen tells me and notes that for younger people the loss of your breast is definitely more difficult.
Read the wide-ranging personal interview with Vieno Kekkonen throughout the day from East Sanoma.

The farmer is committed to the state of the sea.
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voice of experts has been destroyed for political purposes.
In particular, Helsinki’s Sanomat and Yle have, during the summer, been sharing farming responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
Fast action has been required to control emissions in the same life-cycle.
The average farmer appears to be a few environmental scientists and, in comparison with the suppliers that are familiar with it, from a higher nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that a nutrient spray cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been bathed in the field as the crop is repaired.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of nutrients.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the terms and conditions.
Foods stored in fear have also been drowned in water bodies after fertilisation restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers have a desire and readiness to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to the zero level is impossible.
“If we want to have an estimated consumption of agricultural production, it is only acceptable that this is the case,” Jyrki Aakula, Director of the MTT Environmental Research, said.
The summer went to the Gulf of Finland with huge blue-skinned traps.
The researchers were quite unanimous about the fact that the rest received its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is, in part, a potato from agriculture in the coastal states for the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The purification of urban waste water on the Baltic coasts was on the route until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned large-helsing waste water and was not seen as a problem as regards the pollution of its own beaches.
The pollution of the shores was prevented by the construction of the waste water pipeline to the open sea in the 1980s.
The quality of water under control has improved over the years.
Foods that have ended up in the sea will not leave, even if the agricultural sector is completely out of Finland.
However, every single blue debate and accusations presented are always directed at today's agriculture.
Public debate marks the farmer’s guilt in the state of the Baltic Sea.
The blame is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to implement political passions.
The Greens will drive their president, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, under the leadership of major changes to the agricultural environmental standards.
Niinistö has used summer rest conversation.
Niinistö has very much accused producers of using MKT as an old-fashioned organisation and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some border on the political rhetoric.
Most of the specific water protection projects are based specifically on the cooperation of the OCT, farmers and environmental management.
Niinistö’s offensive style serves more fishing of the sound of the city greens than water protection.
I guess that's the purpose too.
With hard talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy change, the task of the MTC is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
For farmers, expensive changes are difficult to trade unless a replacement is found for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has made is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The cancellation of mining tax does not go through: Palmer
The last attempt of the Abbott government to throw a mining tax on the trash can seem to be destroyed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators would reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party is also afraid that the government has included a new initiative to limit the increase of employers to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government used a qualified majority in the House of Parliament on Monday to rush through the process of annulment in the general confusion and in the face of a clear instigation of the Labour Party.
It put aside the original withdrawal initiative, which had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described, above all, in the form of taxes, pension payments, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at repealing the “unsolicited” mining tax and other decisions, such as low income pension contributions (3.6 billion dollars savings), earnings bonus (1.3 billion dollars) and a bonus for school-age children (4.7 billion dollars).
The President of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer did not accept the transfer of the government.
“The planned mining tax withdrawal initiative is not accepted in the Senate without a low income pension fee, a earnings bonus and a bonus for school-age children,” he tweeted.
The government needs support from independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the powers of decision.
“This is unprecedented,” he told reporters in Canberra.
In this way, the Government could delay further increases, allowing the 12% target of the pension contributions of the Labour Party to be transferred up to 2034.
“It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, oppose any means,” Bowen says.
The guarantee amount is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future increases.
The man's body found in Brighton's swimming beach
The Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the rising water of the afternoon. The police closed the area close to the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway.
Police and death investigators are working to find out where the body was placed on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Researchers go through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred in suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, at an accidental explosion at the border, one of the victims of death was killed.
According to the Police of Piedras Negras, an accidental explosion in the customs building in Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is an operational director of the local police at the border of Texas.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in a Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred in the morning at night of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border guarding.
Three Atlantic City Casinos closed in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
The male customer plays in the Showboot Casino, which is supposed to close their doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means, at the same time, that this neon-white, well-known metropolis known as the cash machine's race can no longer be counted on the game income.
More than 5,000 employees remain unemployed in the closure of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office said.
The unemployed will become more when Trump Plaza turns off their light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to work for two years, expected closure is the last disaster in the city after the story of Atlantic Club was completed only eight months before.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, the AP News Office.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors when the casinos of New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania shut down a large part of Atlantic City once in such huge casinos.
Even previously opposed to gambling, Massachusetts look at their own share of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: A new schedule is difficult to accept
According to the Industry Force (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by plant supplier Areva, according to which Olkiluodo’s third reactor is only available for commercial use in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the head of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already largely ready and the number of jobs that are being worked is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the data obtained in Arevala.
Silvennoinen notes that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva submitted today to TVO the updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 that the construction work of the triangular reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
The recent delays in the project have mainly led to the approval of reactor automation systems that were received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been delayed once since.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
There is a dispute in the right of arbitration where Areva has demanded compensation from TVO for a total of EUR 2.7 billion.
On the other hand, TVO considers Areva’s requirements justified and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in the framework of the 24th International Water Week in Stockholm, calling for energy and water actors to work together to respond to the biggest challenges of our time to ensure the growing population of water and energy production.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are often dependent on each other.
Energy is needed for water pumping, storage, transport and cleaning, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two assets are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
At the opening of the Water Week, the CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, Torgny Holmgren, said that “the challenges are enormous.”
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 50, and energy consumption is expected to grow by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water actors to find solutions to allow all the world's nations to flourish.
This year’s Water Award Professor John Briscoe described the water as an enabling base for growth, which needs both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that “the developing countries are facing major challenges.
They need to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the water crisis.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that make up a chain.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water actors during more than one hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize on Thursday 4 September from His Majesty, the Swedish King Charles XVI, from Kulta to Stockholm City Hall.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make wise decisions on water and sustainable development.
Flying of dead alien bodies home in Miami: The cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees were killed in Miami and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of years before, and this certainly was not the last of its quality.
Every year, more than 1 000 Mediterranean migrants die trying illegally to cross the U.S. border.
Because of the first city, we are ready to die.
However, it is ironic that after reaching the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either a asylum, a drawing board up or a time-consuming place when waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine dying there, and when death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In popular cities of migrants, a disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident in the country continue to work with death and return to their homeland.
It is estimated that 20% of the bodies of the dead in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than any other in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of the profession’s word human remains) fly to the home country from the international airport of Miami.
Since 1964, the CEO of Pirerson, the largest company in the industry, said about 80% of this traffic goes abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in the Mediterranean and South America and several European countries.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after his death, the return has its expense.
Miami is the main airport for American Airlines flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the human remains flying back to the country in 2013.
The return of bodies to the home country is not cheap: prices may vary from five to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and general health requirements related to the flow and delivery of human residues vary.
The migrant communities of the cities of migrants sometimes organize funeral communities to help with costs, as the restoration of the bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
Some credit institutions and informal health insurance programmes have been born in the past from such communities as the Italians, Jews and Greeks who lived in New York, the first migrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino and Bangladeshese migrants now operate in many of their popular cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few foreigners plan to make their last resters from the colony city.
For example, in Dubai, without a testament for the dead foreigners, the Sharia law would be respected, even if the laws on the inheritance of the deceased country were different.
The entire property shall be frozen after which it shall be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus (
2013) The scope reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service, but began again in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from the countries that moved it.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person walks through the city of migrants’ popularity or living there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to the colony city is an open declaration of a migrant's way of viewing life, not death.
However, the death in a migrant city abroad means making decisions on whether to belong to the local or global community, to the universe or to the country, to the short-term or eternal.
The Centre and the Left Association make a distinction between the inter-mediate issue
The opposition parties to the centre and the left are going to make an intermediate question to the government about the income of small incomes and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to raise a debate on people's income problems, which are driven by poor economic development and aggravating unemployment.
Growing inequality is also visible between the different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in their communication.
In the next year’s budget, cuts and tax increases are directed at small incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, families and ordinary workers, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing are still growing.
In fact, almost half a million people are unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The problems of working income have also worsened.
Parliamentary groups of the Centre and the Left Association will discuss this on Thursday.
The third opposition party of the Finns has already announced that they are leaving an intermediate question about the resources of the police and internal security.
The parliamentary session will begin tomorrow on Tuesday.
New York City West Indian Day
The Caribbean culture is once again in New York City, where West Indian Day is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there politicians also see each other and come to see each other.
The annual parade is held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It boasts the traditional Carnival Celebrations, and part of it is the dancers who wear complex, often pre-supposed inhabitants.
President Eric Adams of the Brooklyn region is the festival champion of this year, but there is also a lot of other faces known as politics.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the public a week before the pre-election.
In spite of the celebrations, the parade weekend has also been violent over the past few years.
The police have said they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, including by monitoring the operations of nearby gangs.
Do you even need to ask rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, doesn't they?
That question is not worth answering.
This linguistic image, that is, the question that is not expected to be answered, but that suggests a certain response in the direction, tastes both high-aired words and more everyday words.
The first words of Ciceron’s famous Catilina are the rhetorical questions of which the first is “How long, O Catilina, you’re going to take advantage of our patience.”
The same applies to my wife’s questions: “Why shouldn’t I warm up five days old chicken?
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The force of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the public is inclined to accept the question.
A mysterious rhetorical question suggests that no complete one can agree with it.
In the 19th century, author David Williams described the rhetorical question as “some assigned words that have been immeasurably designed to produce a strong feeling of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they put forward is indisputable to disagree.
Taste Skills
Retortal questions can be asked after if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of subsequent rhetorical questions designed to express grief or heartburn are called epilepsy.
For example, Job uses them when he draws them to the Almighty: “What do you benefit from shattering me?”
Do you have the same eyes as we do?
Do you see the same way you see a person?
The chain of rhetorical questions is also found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
You can't do anything right?
There is also a hypofora, which is the case when the question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is a sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
That's right.
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples of my wife: “What is the only food that the children have eaten and where they may have become pains.”
This chicken.
Who the idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetorical question does not usually try to bend, even though rhetoric means the skill of bending.
If you’re trying to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or you’re failing to make some self-esteem, you should use rhetorically questions.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get another to accept their own opinion.
If the public agrees with the statement, “And it’s not nice when it’s so sunny,” the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is certain about his claim, which binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this only happens if the speaker is certain that there are no different opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been achieved instead of seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-evident.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of argument.
The rhetorical question in the headlines of the newspapers is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: “Do the aliens of the pyramids of the space have been built?
In both cases, the risk is that the question may lead to a response that is different from the suggested response.
“Do you think the same as we, was part of the UK Conservative Party’s risky campaign clause in general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
Some of these cases have become a hobby, and the questions of the so-called QTWAIN (the British supplier John Rentoul’s well-known concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, the questions whose answer is no) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends organized a competition where they were looking for the best examples.
“Do You Want Be In My Gang” was clearly won by Gary Glitter, who sang the pop star before he appeared to be a child’s sexual abuser.
The author also wrote the book You Talkin' to Me
Researcher: The time of the federal company may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries were still thinking that the federal state could have some kind of compromise on the conflict, says Saari.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with the Russian channel that peace in eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of people living in the East.
Ukraine's transition into a federal state is, according to the island, a certain priority for Russia's goals.
Ukraine will doubt that, through this, Russia would seek to influence Ukraine’s internal policy, he said.
If a federal solution is not reached, the second option could be a kind of frozen conflict from the point of view of Russia, where Russia would in practice control Luhanski and Donetski, Saari estimates.
Western and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the allegations, although, for example, Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have been fighting for \"separate, volunteer Russian soldiers\".
Director of Upi: Katainen’s planned influential mission
The brick reminds me that the image is new and still imaginative.
He said that Katainen would, in some way, coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment issues.
Of course, the Commission is one of the priorities of the new programme of the period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
In this way we are at the core of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
The Accountant believes that the background, economic knowledge and role of Katainen during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to have a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, it would be unsolicited, i.e. Katainen would not be subject to his own DG.
Instead, Kata should be a team leader in the field of EU competitiveness and employment, where she could be co-ordinated, in addition to the portfolio of other sector-related portfolios.
In practice, team management could mean, for example, design and control.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, in the past two months, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine, and more than 7 000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital of the City of Rostov, near the border of Ukraine, is filled with injuries in the Ukraine War.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their data from the soldiers.
NATO has estimated that there are more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte’s alcohol use: “After a drink, there’s a story.
Big Brother Jussi and Andte started to think about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
On Monday night, Jussi burned a gym bike with Andte, who belongs to the inhabitants of Kartano.
Two people wondered what they were doing in the program’s view.
Not before you saw it, Andte said.
In the opinion of Jussi, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or tasks make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
It’s more waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of Kartano spent the evening in wet markings and alcohol was especially placed on Andte’s talk.
Jussi asked Andtel if the party had made a man’s life more meaningful now that he had been able to speak with other residents in a small hipra.
I'll take a little drink, and then I'll have a story, Andte admitted.
See Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body action in Me Women
Anna Abreu tells us in the Women magazine that she decided to lose her weight two years ago when she left for the gig.
At that time, Anna, tired of the gig, thought that she would gain more energy with weight loss.
Fred Montana / Split News
A couple of years ago, I dreamed of the type of plaster of Victoria's Secret models.
My body was a Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna tells the newspaper.
Anna, who shows up on her body's gigs and music videos, says that she's not a hymo coach, even though she's been named that way.
Viena Kytöjoki
The best Anna in Timm is a gym and a boxer.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain weight on the hall, Anna notes.
Sometimes the pop star gives himself permission with a sense of sensitivity.
If I'm delicious, I'm really sensitive.
Sometimes I take unhealthy nights, and I don't wonder if there's more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'll be shocked if I do something bad for my body.

The profit distribution of companies pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are the leaders of the Australian stock exchange companies today just trying to please a large crowd by granting the shareholders’ wishes for greater profit distribution and buying back their shares?
Is the decision to move from corporate governments to shareholders who are served by the government?
The distribution of profits is the most important one, last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of the shares of companies that have rewarded investors in the form of recovery programmes and by sharing more profits have clearly increased.
There's nothing wrong with that.
However, the other side of the coin is that the consumption of capital is reduced faster than analysts have predicted. This fact makes many people wonder if the short-term popularity is over-emphasized and whether sufficient focus is focused on the growth of the near future and long-term.
Some companies will, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business through other means.
Funding will be acquired more from, for example, cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds obtained from the loan markets are not taken into account, it is clear that transparency for shareholders is financed, above all, by the fact that the company spends less money on investment.
The net result of the wave (and withdrawal of profit investment plans) of this purchase programme is the decrease in capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this reporting period, the period of the capital reduction, during which companies have tried to keep the amount of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the recovery programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised equity procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it sees the consumption of capital as a bright spot in the title of one of its reports.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
The head of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, had to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more fighting spirit to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as consumption of slow capital usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that “the own estimates of the reporting companies’ consumption of their capital have decreased by an average of four percent over the past two years.
The estimates of the amount of free cash flow have increased on average by 2%.
Improving the cash flow is likely to increase the consumption of capital.
This rapid eye effect is good from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some evidence of company obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said the price of the stock for a short time is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
The CEOs are very closely following stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the status of managers depends on it.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are business, increased investment in an organization or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that the investment market is very short-looking.
Therefore, the current lack of conservativeism seems to be a positive step towards short-term objectives.
In the opinion of those who assess the cheap stock market and support capital saving, there is no such concern, but it was too clear during the just-ending reporting period that the weight was to reduce the consumption of future capital, and the most sustainable companies were encouraged.
The large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one in the reduction of capital consumption, but many other companies also operate the same – part of the escape and part because they were afraid of the reaction of shareholders.
Why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to the Credit Suisse’s strategicist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other more traditional fixed-profit investment products have decreased as the central banks have calculated interest rates globally to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to look for profits on the capital market, and they, in turn, pressure companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would rather have the money as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics in the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution had a large impact on the cost cuts of companies and not on the growth of turnover.
In the event of leaks of public nudity, it seems like breaking into a data or an email account
Jennifer Lawrence's pictures and some sources say that the unknown hacker leaked videos to the Internet wonders about security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female public persons in a chatroom and said that he has more photos of women, some of them have reported that their images are counterfeited, while others have said that it was long ago on the images removed.
There is a lot to be described, and it is said that Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton, and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And were the pictures and videos real and from which they were downloaded?
The source of images – an indiscriminate and thorough attack on the Apple iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies like Apple have invested in data security teams working inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company’s own systems on a regular basis.
“The large scale hacking into Apple’s iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be true, notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for the hackers associated with these people of the public (and for hackers who are less famous every day) is the leak of the email address and password, either by guessing or using the information, i.e. by cheating a person to log in to a real-looking site, after which this information is used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to a cloud server.
The user account can be logged in to the iCloud service by giving this email address and password, after which their image and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification-two factor authentication-, 2FA), i.e. additional protection against intrusion into the account, when the code is sent to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few use the 2FA feature, either because it is not known, or because it is considered to be unfavorable.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information comes from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely users' accounts were infiltrated.
The company has not issued an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the password - link in the Apple iCloud service, first collecting the email addresses of the public persons, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in a number of services when passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's images claims that the pictures are real, but don't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took for a rough look.
I feel compassion for all the other people who have been hacked, he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent data security expert Graham Cluley notes that Winstead may have thought that he has removed images of his cell phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images for cloud service, as they often do not have space for a large number of images from the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to save images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones record images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic images and data storage service.
“People take and remove pictures, but they don’t understand that the pictures are downloaded from the account,” Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: “The removal does not always mean deleted,” he says.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone gets access to the user's email address and password, they can download all the pictures and videos that have been sent by email.
Apple service pictures can be downloaded to a Mac machine, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot that was claimed to present videos and images taken from Windows PC so far.
Two-step identification is protected from such hacking, because it requires anyone who is trying to copy an account already available to another device to give the original user a code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo offer a two-step identification account, but it is not yet known whether those public persons used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they claim to be are not real.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the images in which Grande is claimed to be are \"completely counterfeited.\"
Victoria Justice wrote in his tweet: “The naked pictures taken by me are a member of the community, don’t you understand?
Let me break the roots of the rumors right away.
Cluley brings up another option.
Since the hacking targets were people of the public, their accounts may have been broken by someone who cared for their social media accounts or regularly managed their emails.
“I would like to know if any of the actors’ agencies or any of the representatives are involved,” he said.
However, such persons do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed a security attack on the victim’s one or more systems or helped to configure it, and changed the secret system so that all the information can be restored.
This happened in 2011, in the case of Christopher Chaney, who received the hollywood hacker, where the hacker distributed images of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunsis in the case of ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 damages.
Chaney was accused of intrusion into an email account of more than 50 entertainment industries during the period from November 2010 to October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of this stylist, and then published photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy that could be imagined.
Chaney also claimed to keep two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, “In Chuney’s case, stars’ email accounts were broken, and they were changed so that someone sent their information further after the password was changed.
Cluley says that the forced action of hackers breaking into these accounts is a reminder of the collection of butterflys.
They just want to collect such information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of services such as Dropbox, containing information and login data.
Hackers can also try to penetrate for a long time.
or they were able to access the information of an e-mail account, such as the address book, and then fished the information of other persons.
I don't think it would be a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria.
The terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to have held 44 Feds of peacekeeping prisoners. The terrorist group conquered the crossing site in the Golan hills last week and forced the United Nations troops to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and there is no information about their location.
Ministers, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit, and he has offered Australian assistance in order to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
“I’ve convinced Australia to help the UN in everything it can, by providing, for example, intelligence services,” he told the AAP news service on Monday.
We keep in touch with all the cooperation and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will exercise its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the peacekeeping team of Filipino prisoners in their military armies was reported to have escaped in various parts of the same controversial region.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan hills since Syria and Israel’s ceasefire in 1974.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money with the help of a coal tax withdrawal initiative, warns the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Cheaters use the carbon tax withdrawal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses from relying on government agencies for too good sound offers that offer thousands of dollars of credit.
Cheaters may use the media figures to prove to the consumer how much he can save in the purchase of goods after the loss of carbon tax and offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
Cheaters may sound very convincing because they have cleared the victim’s personal information that they use in trying to obtain bank information or in trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They talk about current issues to deceive the victim.
Cheaters use more than carbon tax fraud to get their money. Their stories are more advanced, and they use current things to make a scam around them.
The plane lost by Malaysia Airlines and Robin Williams' death have inspired scammers.
ACCC instructs you to contact the company by means of self-reported contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller if there is a slight doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you get an unexpected call or an e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government’s agency or company, such as the energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation due to the cancellation of the carbon tax, please beware.
If you believe that you have become deceived and provided personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, the government’s sharing of free money – it is likely.
Economics: Lipponen blames EU Russian sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Liponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU for Russia in the interview of Economics.
Russia's priority in politics is to drive its own interests.
This is not necessarily the case, Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started his work as the business director of the business of the Central Economic Union in the Arctic regions of the European Union.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended Russian project funding as part of the EU’s economic sanctions.
“It means, for example, that environmental projects with clear views of the northern dimension go to the ice,” Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampered by cooperation, which, according to Lipposen, can be difficult if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue as much as before.
He is currently working on an EC study of Finland’s Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It does not affect the situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report is a long way forward, we talk about tens of years, he says.
It is rare for the elephant to come to a low water or near the facility, says the natural pedagogical centre of Vesa Heinonen Pohjanmaa Museum.
In Vaasa Suvilahde, we saw the elephant swimming near the beach on Sunday.
According to Heinonen, the elephant has probably come after Suvilahti's food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
For example, on the Sundom Bridge, we see especially the spring and autumn norpps that come to the place just after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the sea area of Vaasa.
In the payday, we see nomp in the lobbys of the villa, and he continues.
Norppia lives, among other things, in the Ocean and the Saarist Sea.
According to the Court of Southern Australia, the murdered pizzeriaist Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the night club.
Murdered South Australian pizzeriaist Robert Vallelon.
In the poll of justice, Robert Vallelon, a pizzeriaist, has been aggressively acting for both his partner and the security officer only for minutes before he was killed outside the night club.
In the lower court of Adelaide, lawyers accused of the killing of Vallelonga called for the release of their clients against guarantees, as it was clearly a matter of self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind the tents until the trial.
According to the evidence, the dead behaved aggressively that he had to be removed from the night club,” he said.
After that, the doll began, which resulted in this 40-year-old drowned man... tearing up the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death caused one shot, which clearly refers to self-defense or the defence of another.
A 25-year-old man is still charged with murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was discovered unconsciously near the cross of Rundle St and Synagogue Place on May 4, 25, and had serious head injuries.
He died in his injuries at the Royal Adela Hospital the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers remained dying of One Tree Hill's local legend.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver, he fled to sleep for a few days.
But now, the security camera video shows something else, Shaw says.
\"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and became part of his hard and violent behavior,\" he said.
On our customer’s side, there is both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defends himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors were opposed to the release of the man because only one of the three security officers at the scene had been missing Vallelonga's behavior.
According to them, other security officers didn't think he was threatening, because he was short, and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They also said that the taxi driver who clearly saw the case would prove that Vallelonga was hit with strength, and he did not have the opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Shepherd ordered the man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - on the basis of its tradition - foreign news - Evening Sanomat
The worst weather was expected to be delayed in the world of widespread inflamed hunting.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A great deal of opposition from the yachts that have been part of the world is reported, among other things, by the British newspaper Guardian.
In hunting, the hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote baying pit, where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The meat of the dolphins also becomes food.
However, according to local authorities, hunting was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
Information about the practice spread to the world through the 2009 documentary The Cove.
During the previous hunting periods, the hunting has also been criticised by animal protectors, as well as diplomats.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat has, in any case, a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to the Japanese government, those who defend hunting, which also read, are a tradition.
The defenses have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was opposed to demonstrations in several countries.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, Japan’s reputation was damaged.
A protest was held in Helsinki on Monday before the Embassy of Japan.
Some NATO member states are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
The military union within NATO is divided into the view of whether NATO should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the Ukrainian crisis, the Financial Times said.
Poland and Estonia have requested military alliances to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russia’s policy, and it threatens to pour Europe’s security,” said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
The NATO member states are gathered in the beginning of the week, and the military union is expected to publish its new preparedness plans.
The main question of the plan is whether NATO could violate the TUE Agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
The NATO and Warsaw Federation agree on how they place armed forces in the Atlantic and Ural mountains.
In practice, the agreement prevents the Financial Times from introducing new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic.
Russia itself suspended its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not expressly withdraw the agreement.
Due to the crisis in Ukraine, NATO will consider whether the terms of the agreement still need to be respected.
“There must be great resources in all NATO countries that need resources,” said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the UK Parliament’s Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller flew around the youngest world
When other teenagers taught to drive a car, Matt Guthmiller taught him to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller just flew around the youngest world, and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man in South Dakota flew 30 000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five continents.
On his journey, Guthmiller was treated as a rock star thanks to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
“A rich puppy just wants to see a little world and have fun.
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the speakers of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but there was also a lot of work to do, and I hope that, in my record, I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight start as young as he was, and first he asked his parents to eat in the cafés of airports.
He later asked for flight classes.
My parents let me go to a short flight of $20, a 20-minute flight, but I think my enthusiasm would stop it.
I didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon concluded an agreement with his parents to allow him to spend more time in the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father, instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the auction store.
By 17 years of age, Guthmiller had received a flight licence, and two years later, he leased a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his own flight around the world.
A young man at the MIT high school took care of the aircraft and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the upper eyes also meant that he himself needed more money.
In practice, there are a lot of caffeine and Oreos biscuits.
Guthmiller says he's eaten a few inventors all over a long flight.
Flying into the cloud was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries were not regulated to help them navigate the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were only slightly above the plane, and which rose to the height of 45,000 feet and teared into pieces of the aircraft.
Guthmiller's plane was not under pressure and there was no oxygen supply, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would not have been higher.
On the day following the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between the American Samoa and Hawaii called Guthmiller as the hardest part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the rise phase is technically challenging because of the high fuel needed for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the risks and even the high level of the crime, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for the ATK training through the Code.org website.
He is a coder himself, and founded his own company at the age of 12 years.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see how it goes.
Guthmiller wants to go high anyway.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding a real franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited about jogging his fans to his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after Canada’s W TV channel began to show The Cupcake Girls program in 2009.
The innovation continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
“My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers would be jogging outside the store ready to buy a cup cake, and he would not bear the situation,” says Joyce.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the meeting, Joyce decided to change the process of choosing franchise partners from the point of view of emphasising the company’s culture in place of baking skills.
\"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear, he says, adding that he has held about 100 interviews on each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but employees work in a completely different way in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult. Therefore, the training we emphasize, above all, the compatibility of business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organization, while a poorly qualified manager can cause expensive damage to the company.
“Before I thought looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like dating, but it’s not true at all, you can do a lot to get to know each other before you get married,” says Joyce.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a contract will be signed, a guarantee will be obtained and a new store will be built.
Taking a partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of confidence.
The symbiotic relationship between the French parties resembles a strong marriage, as they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
For this reason, McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful in complaining about the future franchise donor before taking such a long-term partnership.
“This is the same idea as in relationships: if a date partner is rude enough to date, imagine what he is in marriage,” he said.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contract partner and pay attention to the smallest alarm marks on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those who work as a franchise donor must be more careful in choosing the first, most important partners.
New franchise donors must once again be expected to conclude on the basis of a successful parent company, what challenges they have faced and what skills a new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise donors may also request the help of the French adviser in order to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also recalls that, for the first time, people working as franchise sensors and entrepreneurs have a great deal of help on the CFA website at rakforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later, as franchise donors learn to better evaluate potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can provide advice and help evaluate.
“The first franchise partner’s contribution helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in this creation of the company and the franchise system,” says Erik Church, O2E Brands, CEO of O2E Brands, O2E Brands, companies, including 1-800-GOT-JUNK, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a member of the Toronto franchise of You Move Me.
The Chruch method for finding the right franchise partner is simple.
“The trust test we use is to ask ourselves, ‘Do I talk to this person to me at the barbecue for the weekend?’” he says.
If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking for solutions with them to major business challenges.
In addition, Church notes that O2E Brands is largely grateful for its franchise.
In a business organisation, managers often see their position as short-term and at a lower level of leadership very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs take a partnership with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
“The French partnership has much more good aspects than traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense,” he said.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well managed it produces better results.
Railway delays reduce the prices of cereals in the North of the United States
Delayed train transports have led to a significant fall in the prices of cereals in the northern middle of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to be under the new pressure of the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the state of North Dakota offer farmers $2.7 from the bus – about a dollar less than the control prices - the reason for ensuring the capacity of the rails, traders and agricultural organisations, above all.
IN Raw Materials
The problems are the most acute on the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
The Federal Railway Officer organises a consultation on the service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, railways will have to rely on the transport of agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in trains increased when the large harvest in 2013 followed by a very cold winter that caused the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from North Dakota Bakken’s oil fittings has separated the grain transport, which is not correct according to the railway companies.
According to a manager of an international crop trading company, the costs of cereals and transferable sellers for ensuring the use of the train have risen from zero to $2 000 per truck per year.
Someone has to pay the costs.
“These costs are paid either by the farmer or by the customer,” says the head of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota’s soya beans will grow by more than a third and that the spring crop yield is 16%.
Randy Gordon, President of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that “normally we are trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e. the crop is empty enough storage space and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late because of the recent problems in the service of trains.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will process the transport of this year’s harvest smoothly.
John Miller, the vice-president responsible for the transport of agricultural products from the BNSF company, said that the company has reduced the number of long-term carriages (the train wagons ordered by customers that have passed more than four days) from the beginning of April to 16 500, to about two thousand.
“We have moved almost everything from the old harvest that we were supposed to transfer,” Miller says, referring to the previous crop in the remaining grain.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF’s crop trains were 9 percent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that development is \"unfair\", but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of products transported, such as grain congestion.
Because of the second fog, the speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company suffering from problems are 11 per cent lower than in the past year, but clearly higher than in the beginning of the year much lower speeds.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has said to the Railway Controller (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its train wagon ordering system should improve its ability to handle transport by 15 % over the next harvest period.
“The action plan of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains in order to deliver more and more trains every week,” the railway company said.
Ukraine's crisis can solve NATO's identity crisis.
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the major countries have often been concerned about NATO’s future and whether the end of the NATO Afghanistan Commission itself means the end of NATO.
However, this concern is very premature, as is apparent at the NATO summit held at the Wales Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
The role list of politicians and diplomats has no shortage of the world’s crises, even to the extent that the expulsion of the Afghan troops, which had previously been a priorityist, is no longer the most important thing.
Instead, the 28-state alliances are needed to reintroduce Russia to Ukraine, which must be a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money to military expenditures and re-commence defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
“It’s (NATO) looking for some kind of purpose -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis,” says Heather Conley, Head of the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies European Programme.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also strengthened it.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to create a common strategy to quickly promote the destruction of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his partners in the war to respond to military responses, particularly those crossing the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to win the extremist Islamists, first of all to find out that “we have no strategy.”
Western experts have put careful expectations at the summit on whether there will be breakthroughs in Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Further economic sanctions are planned as the main means of punishment for the event called the Russian attack in Ukraine.
The European Union officials dealt with this on the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
U.S. officials pointed out that the countries that Obama wishes for are the main partners in the Islamic problem may not be NATO members.
The collapse of the problems could not be predicted two years ago, when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was controlled by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
Robert M. Gates, the former leader of the year, used his last speech to say that the organization has reached almost the point of being a common military infidelity.
U.S. officials constantly complained that other states did not achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to use two percent of their GDP in defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – reached this target last year.
But now the White House officials say they noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff, where they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that the company had a genuine desire for real threats in the Member States tomorrow.
After Russia's infiltrated Ukraine, the Union's defence promises are more important and more important than ever after the end of the Cold War,\" says Charles Kupchan, President of the U.S. National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus between the 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation for Russia’s worried neighbouring countries.
The president begins his trip to Tallinn, Estonia, with a three-day visit to Estonia, where he meets the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine this year, and NATO's troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new preparedness plan, published this week, will be introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in the border states, officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes represent a small risk for NATO, which was suspended from establishing permanent bases for the friendlyness of Eastern and Central Europe towards Russia.
According to officials, the new plan is not really a violation of the agreement, but it can also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to name his name in connection with the discussions before official information.
NATO’s presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, diplomat said.
Is Putin an effective “talviase” using it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one seat in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of armed rebels in eastern Ukraine and of sending Russian troops to Ukraine's soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has been tightened, the Western countries are planning harder sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a watch card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary sources of energy are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, an active in Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When the winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the conflict, the Ukrainians will remain in their homes when gas supply from Russia becomes humidified.
Therefore, if rebels fail to achieve their goals, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s debt for gas was $5.3 billion (about EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I don't think anyone thinks about it anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hatred and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to supplement stocks, necessary repairs must be made and prepared for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company, Nomura, pointed out last month that Russian talks on humanitarian issues and the planning of a potential new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be intensified in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay for future gas supplies unless the Kiova industry pays accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow the continuation of gas imports to continue on a temporary basis.
Last week, Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenuk said that Russia plans to stop gas supplies in the EU in winter.
The Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak said that the speeches were endless.
He said that Russia will do its utmost to deliver gas to the EU countries.
Liberal Aldabloggari has 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand shatters
Saudi Arabian court has held a 10-year prison sentence for Raif Badaw, founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The sentence includes an additional penalty of a thousand pieces of scrap and a fine of millions (about 200 000 euros).
The court was founded on the fact that he had established Islamic degraded website.
On Monday, the judge told AFP the other founder of the organization Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced in July 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 injures, but the sentence was appealed and re-trialed.
The judgment was also filed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala’s childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one of the revolutionary human encounters.
Madventures published today a new book on the World explanatory memorandum - an adventurer’s explanation for everything.
We asked Riku Rantal about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most important human encounter of his life.
The author, the reporter, the other party of Madventures, Riku Rantala, is a busy man.
Today, a new book has been published, yesterday was a filmmaker at the Civil Service and on Wednesday begins the second production period of Ylelä Docventures.
Until morning, he's run from place to place.
From Makari's morning-tv to the child to take him to the day-care home and there to a weekly friend.
The most beautiful interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, we don't have time.
In the midst of everything fast, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write a World explanatory book, which, according to the cover of the book, is an adventurer's manuscript for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why the other culture is doing worse than the other one, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes professors as well as artists.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've buried a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that the world needs to know more and big questions is worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is to be good travel reading, but it is also designed to make people talk and share thoughts at home.
The discussion may even lead to action,” says Riku.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, it is necessary to believe that at some point we are making solutions to improve our situation.
The Earth is a sort of alcoholic.
First, it should be admitted that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku Philosophoid.
According to some studies, Western humanity has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, wealth has not increased our happiness.
It can be concluded that when money is sufficient and our basic needs have been met, we are happy.
Money doesn't add happiness.
We want to wake people up to talk about what is enough.
Making use of our natural resources is not enough for a long time, says Riku.
You will also consider cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from Finland?
People don't differ.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
The most culturally important difference is that the Community is much bigger in India than in evil.
When the West is prosperous, people live more alone.
We are isolated from others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find the right balance between socialism and loneliness, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
The crime has faced a lot of different people in the world.
What is the best thing to do with human beings?
It is my childhood when I was with my family on my first big trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan while my father was there in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old and two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku.
There was a big car moving home in Finland.
We went to war in Afghanistan when there was a huge number of refugees on the road.
On the road, a girl my age was walking with her little brother in her arms.
I sat on a big mermaid bench in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age realizes the situation.
It was one of the memorable human encounters that I will always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna in 2013 at a book fair.
At that time, the Riku – me on the counter – that other people must be respected, even if they are significantly poorer or they do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
At that time, the crime realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adults, people in New Guinea will rise to the surface.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditional people were living there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, do not just use money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think.
And he wants to have a new book with Tunna.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen more.
To make people act in a warm love conversation, or even to a fist fight, Riku throws.
It's about the Kauhajoki magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived at the bus station and they ordered a taxi.
When the taxi went out, the man in the yard threw a taxi on his head for a thing.
The driver got out of the car, as well as the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw him on the scene stabbed the male passenger in a life-threatening way to the head and to the hand and left the place.
The knifer is 170-175 centimetre tank, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young woman in the vicinity of the venue.
He's hoping to get in touch with the police.
The police will also request clues for any person who may have observed events or persons associated with the incident.
The accident occurred on Wednesday at 7.50 p.m.
\"Moi,\" said the brain to the brain - the world's first - telepathic - the message passed through the Internet.
PLoS ONE has published an article that the international team of researchers has managed to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were \"hola and \"ciao\", i.e. Spanish and Italian \"moi\".
The test was carried out to monitor the electric power supply of the transmitter.
The sender was trained with the help of the program to send bits either by hand or by thinking about the movement of the foot.
The design of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands to one.
This data encoded as a bit was sent via the Internet to the recipient person.
The receiver was subjected by magnetic stimulation to an observation of the light-reflecting from each one to the encoded bit.
The recipient had been taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers acknowledge that it is still a field of study in their children's shoes, but believe computerized telepathic communication is routine in the near future of humanity.
Packages - Point - Future of the countryside
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also blackmailing its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States to respond when Russia is fighting in Ukraine and occupied by Crimea.
In international politics, the act follows the reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be reduced in the long term.
Iran was made to negotiate its nuclear programme only after years.
The South African looting government sat in place for decades, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take top electronics and military technology.
Russia itself has imposed barriers to trade on the world page.
Last time, the wood trade was frozen.
It is clear that sanctions do not make Russia on its knees.
The Russians have used to bad times, and the loss of Viola from the store causes panic.
When the EU intends to prohibit imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians will drink the vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to ship air carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is the end of imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
Most of the problems arise from the constraints of the financial sector.
They will only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate in the international loan market.
It needs to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge currency reserves, they do not last forever.
The availability of credit for Russian companies is expensive.
The banks are not able to finance everyone.
We need to push more money, or we need to make a payment problem for businesses.
Competitions are competitions in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia’s modernization will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in the Helsinki Sanoma.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In short, Russia would return to Russia once again and be inconceivable.
An exceptional free button event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international freepaints held in Pjongjang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, who moved from the Lawyer to be a free-presser, took part in the events of Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free games, local athletes also saw taekwondo games.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was through sport to bring the countries concerned closer together and promote peace of the world.
Politicians hoped to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of the kidnapping of the Japanese.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
Last seen in North Korea the international free press in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the organisation of the trade in goods.
The Yt negotiations began in June, when a reduction was estimated at no more than 130.
According to the company, its organization has now been broken down into overlapping functions and areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK says that it is clearly seeking better cost efficiency and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the recession of the economy and the decline in consumer demand, there is a structural change in the trade, which has been particularly nourished by the trade in goods.
The result of the S Group’s trade in goods has been lost for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK’s use and daily goods trade, i.e. about 530 people.
Market News: Some of the medicines behind the counter
According to the magazine, more drugs are coming between prescription medications and prescription drugs themselves, which should be obtained without a prescription, but only after the advice of the pharmacist employee.
According to the Finnish Agricultural Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be subject to advice.
After interviewing Farmaeut or pharmacist and meeting the pre-defined criteria, the drug should be provided with a seal, considered by the President of the Farmasian Association Kirsi Kvarnström in Turku’s Sanoma.
Finland already needs a few medicines without a prescription, but it requires advice.
One of these is a reconception.
Corruption for More Reasons
Finland pays more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the lack of bribes and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry's working group will consider whether there would be a need for a criminal law to trade and abuse influence.
For example, the differences in legislation emerged in the legal treatment of Patria’s bribe in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The trade of influence in Slovenia brought two years of imprisonment to the former prime minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same criminal name.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the recently completed map, donations are not being studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police College on corruption in different areas.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he's getting the educators at Asian Championships League in Korea
Tony Popovic has three key players in Korea.
Many of the players in the Western Sydney Wanderers team are banned in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic did not hesitate to throw other players at the Asian Championships League witch boiler FC Seoull.
The Wanderers are in Dubai with a 10-day exercise camp, including two friends in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match on September 17.
Because of the excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole leave the Korean trip, but Coach Popovic believes their turahs.
“I suppose this is a loss – they’ve been three very important players in ACL to us,” Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from playing in China from this gesture.
It's a setback, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been hurt.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone in semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovicia, which will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The defender of the Socceros team was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play a return match at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
\"He's back on the job and he's gonna be fine,\" Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been training a couple of times outside, which is good.
It's gonna take a while before he's completely okay, but he's gonna be fine.
At Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world’s top facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes in the end of the last season.
“We know this will certainly help players create ties,” Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better on the field and outside.
We use the camp for many purposes.
Elite’s hamburger pays three times the employee’s monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to belong to the elite of the country.
The Financial Times tells us about the recession.
In North Korea, the informal market may flourish more than ever.
They offer the luxury of wealthy or saving ordinary citizens, which is not used to joining the dictatorship state.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council Wishing for Sale
The Stormont Council is hoping to find a buyer for Ormisto House, Belfast, a building that cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern part of the city from the 19th century 13 years ago and paid £9 million.
The Council failed to continue to sell the building, when the safety and maintenance of the building came to the Council to cost around £400 a day.
The building was sold at a rate of 1.25 million pounds.
The building will obviously be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a building classified as a category B of historical value with 9 million pounds in 2001 because it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was re-selled at a price of 2.5 million pounds this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist party, suggested that Ormiston House might be the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the editor, the building will be moved to the new owner, as long as the paperwork are completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent about the buyer’s identity and sales price.
Ormisto House’s weekly security and repair costs are around £3,000.
The Council bought the building from the police forces that led the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
The security costs of Ormisto House by the beginning of this year amounted to 885 641 pounds and maintenance costs of 371 379 pounds.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was 250 015 and the remuneration of development and design professionals was 212 466 pounds.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after the death of Lord Pirrien, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it to Campbell College in 1928, which held it until the mid-70s.
“Equality increases: Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There is no savings, according to JHL.
In Helsinki, there is a radical reduction in the number of school-specific school assistants.
The reduction would not concern a child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Education Board decided to present a total of about 2.7 million carousels of the resources of school assistants.
There are around 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is necessary to make it easier for donors to reduce their savings, since the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not created, on the contrary, the working burden of the teaching staff is increasing.
Schoolmen’s savings lead to a greater risk of falling from the goals of learning and sharing teachers are also hard, stressing the JHL’s CEO, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki value schools because young schools and students who need support will no longer receive assistant resources.
The City of Helsinki aims to prevent exclusion.
The prevention of income is precisely done by school assistants.
However, the adjustment measures of the Finnish Education Agency are aimed at this group in most respects.
In the future, all parties will suffer from this.
The final solution on resources will be made in the autumn by the Helsinki City Council, to whom I hope to see the vision and wisdom of the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, Niemi-Laine said.
Israel's Power on the West Coast
Israeli women walk in the Jewish settlement of Gavaot near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel conquered almost 400 hectares of land on the West Bank, near Bethlehem. This may be a sign of Israel’s significant construction in the region, and at the same time threatens the Palestinians’ request not to build more foundations and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli-Peace Now- group, which opposed to the expansion of the West Bank institutions, considered that Sunday events could be the largest single country's takeover in the West Bank region for decades and could dramatically alter the situation in the region.
The Palestinians aim to establish their own state for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political passion for the assessment of the situation in rural areas came after the three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they landed in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the takeover of the land implies that it was intended to be a kind of compensation for the population and punishment of the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot facility, the land area in the Etzion region of South Jerusalem is now officially declared as the country of the state, when it was before in the private ownership of the Palestinians. This was a necessary step so that Israel could start planning buildings in the region.
However, the mayor of Surif, the nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinians’ official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff were publishing orders early on Sunday, where Israel announced that it would take over the lands containing the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Possible objections should be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people was carried out by the Israeli army on the west coast by a disciplinary return against the Islamist group in Gaza, Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The following tensions, along the border of Israel and Gaza, encamped in the war of 50 days, which ended last week in Egypt to bring about a ceasefire.
The conquest of the land has quickly drawn attention to the western coast of the Israelis and revealed the controversial objectives of the Israeli government that hinder the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crises are usually complex.
A larger proportion of Lapland’s municipalities are in problems, according to a well-being study by Lapland University and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crises.
According to the professor, reducing municipal tasks by a billion euros is not enough.
The common features of crises include poor municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Asko Suikkainen at the University of Lapland’s sociology, new crisis structures are coming from the western border and East Lapland.
In the survey survey, residents are fairly realistic about the situation in their municipality.
In the study, the residents of well-informed municipalities even viewed pessimisticly.
There are strong expectations of consumption.
People hope that the present everyday and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time, we are not afraid to think about longer-term investments, such as the purchase of an apartment, says Suikkanen.
The team was surprised by the large differences between municipalities.
For example, expenditure on income support per capita varies from two to ten to over one hundred euros.
The tax revenue per capita of the municipality varies from two thousand euros to 4400 euros in the Ranua fair.
According to the Suikkas, Lapland’s municipalities are different.
How to use the money, how much to get in public shares, and what is the degree of debt, is much different in each of the same situations, he says.

Britain may close borders with returns from Islamists
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamists leaving Iraq and Syria to the homeland.
This is about BBC’s government sources.
According to the BBC, however, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizenship.
According to the government, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is being finalised and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities in such a way that they could temporarily seize the passports of potential fighters on the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of terrorist threats to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is happy with the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from the Liberian prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from prison in Liberia today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities were expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that “all things are going well, and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released from the Australian authorities tonight, and then he will rise to a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
“We are happy with the news that he is likely to be released today,” the representative said to the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor will probably fly to Rome before the trip to his home to Haag.
Taylor and three of his criminal court attorneys were arrested in the city of Zintani on June 7, when they represented the son of Seif al-Islam, the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took the papers to the Seif, which they believed threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to release Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya in the last month to drive this thing.
Taylor couldn't talk to his husband or his little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to call his short phone call home to Haag shortly after his visit to the Australian ambassador, David Ritche.
Carr also spoke with Taylor's parents John and Janell, who were relieved to hear Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had been betting on the release of their daughter in Libya before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other detainees are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of the debate between the lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities, the lawyer was sorry and apologized for the possible misconception.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to investigate the actions of its team thoroughly after its members returned home.
“After the decision of the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrongly will be convicted in a proper manner,” he said in his statement last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam to commit crimes against humanity during the reign of his father, which ended surprisingly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and launched on 1 May, in which it announced that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in the Hague.
Young entrant saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona won its second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but the easy way did not fall at Villarreal at home.
The blue-red squeaking head of the Villarreal-sighted Sergio Assenjo until the 82th minute finally managed.

From Barcelona's 2nd team, I call a young man in the mission crew to finish near when Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess's company.
Collections for the Ferguson Police ended mysteriously after $433 000 overrun
Surprisoners closed two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend for over $40,000 for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri State.
For the general public, on the GoFundMe Charity Site, two separate pages, bearing similar names – \"Support Officer Darren Wilson – and \"Support Officer Wilson\" – have collected $235 750 and $197 620 for the ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by the Brown family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by many weeks of restlessness and demonstration, mostly against the almost white police forces that were inhabited by the blacks. This forced Wilson to hide while local and federal studies were trying to decide whether to shoot Brown without a reason.
The network collection campaigns have led to some confusion about Wilson’s defense, especially since some visitors on the page had written a comment on racist comments that have since been deleted.
Both sides apparently stopped taking donations on the same Saturday, and the owners of the pages did not give any reason for this.
When trying to give a donation on the page, he sees a message that says, “The divorces are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website informed Los Angeles Times that the site had not prevented donations.
“Every organizer of the GoFundMe campaign will decide when to stop receiving donations,” Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website, said in a statement.
Organizers can also continue receiving donations later.
‘Support Officer Wilson’, the result of which was $197,620, maintains a charity group consisting of St. Louis's police, Shield of Hope, a host of donations approved by GoFundMe.
The three policemen, Joseph Eagle, Timothy Zoll, and Jeffrey Roorda, who were appointed official representatives of the Shield of Hope Group's State Collection Register, did not respond immediately on Sunday to e-mails asking for more information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official adviser of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florida City Council and a member of Roorda Missouri House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the \"Support Officer Darren Wilson\" page, who uses the name \"Stand Up\" and has collected $235 750.
However, the GoFundMe website representative assured The Times that there was an anonymous charity.
Only little information has been given to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
The anonymous Wilson page charity wrote a message to visitors on the site two weeks ago that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope Group to become officially accepted as receiving donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The Beneficiary gave visitors more information about the Gmail e-mail address that they would like, but did not reply immediately on Sunday to the request for more information.
In his newsletter to The Times, the GoFundMe representative said that the anonymous collection page had been removed from the search results of the main site and added that “the campaign will no longer meet the requirements of the GoFundMe website that should be used to be a working Facebook account.
In the information security policies of the GoFundMe website, users are invited to only donate to GoFundMe users who are personally aware of and rely on.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on GoFundMe is accurate and fair.
According to Agent Little, GoFundMe has, however, been in contact with the campaign organizer, and it has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to reserve all the funds collected if it is necessary to start research in the context of a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds collected in this campaign.
The popular Facebook page, \"Support Officer Wilson\", which has organized Wilson-backed campaigns, told the followers of the page on the weekend that lawyers are trying to find out why GoFundMe’s donors have been prevented from donate, but the page did not give any further information.
The Facebook page also has an anonymous operator, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
