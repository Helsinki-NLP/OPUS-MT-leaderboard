A nine-year-old boy in Tampere was found
Police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip in Tampere on Tuesday night.
Loss notice of a son who left West Tampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police situation center, the boy has been contacted and he has no life and health risk.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanonom about half-night knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the post-conflicts.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a hurricane - tearing the goal difference in Messin
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league on the weekend and continued his factory on the Champions League.
The competition between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Masters turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo was alone at the top of all time's painting statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetsk network with two hits on the penalty and one on the gaming situation.
Ronaldo raised his title balance to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has been in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the league of the Masters, it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning painting made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored the absence of a knee-flying Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's election game, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second club, United, also experienced a hard experience in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered 1-2 drops.
The 20-year-old assistant Luke Shaw's visit to ManU only took a watch.
The dangerous-looking sliding resistance of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target of the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely broken into the leg.
Shaw slept with Eindhoven's home stadium lawn for ten minutes before the medical staff left to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests 41 minutes to 1-0, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno fixed before the break with an extra time.
In the second half, Luciano Narsingh made the winning painting of the PSV.
In the league of the Masters of the Painting season, Part A began in Paris Saint-Germain.
Manchester United's shirt's PSG had changed from Argentina to Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball to the back corner of Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been drawn to the successers of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is part of the length of the league, is not the best possible comparison.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional career in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TssSKA lost a block B game in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition Party immediately called for a difference - the president said the wrong speech
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had held a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again held the same speech in Parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not realize that the speech was the same during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full-life power.
The MDC called for Mugabe to resign because it is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants were rushing to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s presidium and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will assess the request.
According to German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe will be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers include Merkel on the table of Interior Ministers.
The teacher admits that he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice is just a little colourful university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb emphasized that his “gold dog” is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman’s closest contacts can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found a hand-written message on Amy Prentiss' body and the green page: “I am so sorry that I could cancel this beloved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me,” said the letter, which according to experts, was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where the police believe he had shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the University staff of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while later.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose again: Lamb committed suicide when he was surrounded by a police officer.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information stating that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher with problems.
Students said they were waiting for her hours.
The Prentis's death scene, Gautier, the police said that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb’s book, in which he thanked “the great people” with whom he shared the life of academics.
Both were taught by the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, as if something had been wrong.
The second student, Mikel Sykes, said Lambin told me he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014.
Lamb had previously asked for a hospital at Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's remuneration principles meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral value, it did not reverse his automatic career development and the assistant professor's office.
William LaForge, director of the University, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in the mind of Lamb.”
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got to him when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-calibre gun in the backyard of a house about a half a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Mississippi Greenville, said Methel Johnson, the Washington County's death investigator.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and educational science. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed a doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said he was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met with friends.
Hairston's friend was in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston to play guitar for many years.
He was a bit charming in those days.
All the girls were melted with wax when he was there, now said 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentis had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverfront brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
The former husband, Shawn O'Steen, told them that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
“She’s really upset,” O’Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentis when Lamb and Abigail both appeared in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called with some gigs.
O'Steen said his daughter was doing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bar of the Jules Room near Gautier, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentis last night, the 5th September, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip bite show to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
\"Only a happy couple,\" he said.
We played games and threw whispers to each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminar program and was specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times, said the school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas Empire State University and was the chairman of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday evening, at Cleveland Delta State campus, a candle training took place, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair, during which the university choir sang songs by Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The study continues on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to Mississippi Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster of the Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected to say that the police now say Lamb called the emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that, although Lamb pointed out during the call as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to employ 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while the number of employees hired during the 2014 holiday period was 45,000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, the Christmas season is approaching, companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his \"treffie\" with Princess Diana
The first night of the future film was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in a future documentary film at Back in Time Trailer.
The film begins and reminds me that I'm just a stretch of tea and a stretch of my hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the Return to the Future film, interviewed with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said to me, “It’s the most beautiful time travel movie of all time.
Back in Time is available as an order video, DVD and some movie theaters in October.
President of the United Nations says that Syria will not solve the situation by armed means.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict - will not be solved by armed means - and more arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering millions of people.
The UN leader once again called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference in mid-week, Ban announced that he will meet the ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the General Assembly's Ministerial Meeting later this month to discuss Syria.
He was sorry that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces could not be resolved.
Ban called for five permanent Member States to demonstrate Syria's crisis by addressing solidarity and consensus that they showed when negotiating Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support Reporters That Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to stamp him into the wind.
Others only think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump off the top of the suffering questionnaires, it has not succeeded.
Of the last 11 national questions, the 10 Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit century, and some have started to seriously reflect on what this means in terms of the appointments of the real estate.
The election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
At this stage, the commentators note that Rick Perry was losing his leadership to Herman Cain, who neither of which received any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump’s toughness and began to use his funds to cover him.
The following recent reports suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's recommendations have made a complete translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, Monmouth University’s suffering surveys showed that only two Republicans from ten were in favour of real estate.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans are happy with Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a suffering interview by the University of Quinnimarket in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they were happy with Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either \"innovated or satisfied\" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be shocked if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson will achieve the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% – inspired – vs. Trump 40%).
The next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be dissatisfied, or shocked, if they became candidates for Jeb Bush's favorites.
The nature of Trump's fires is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, the ABC News/Washington Post survey says 52% of Republican voters at national level think that real estate gold has an appropriate quality for the President.
According to a survey of the Quinni market last week, in the first party meeting in the state of Iowa, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Posti poll, 44% believe that his character is not suitable for the president, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican speakers are used to thinking.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be nominated as the Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary period, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry to be a candidate and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Although Republicans would support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the straight field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, the survey carried out at Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives the majority of support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and Rand Paulia, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's on the spot with Ted Cruz.
The only winner of Trump?
If they were put in the opposite position, Ben Carson would win a big 18-point difference from the businessman Trump.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of Trump’s eligible voters have decided who their voice is going to be.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be completely sure to say that they would never change their mind.
46% said they could change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice more likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “raisers” in his campaign analysis speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s capacity to drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and harms rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post questionnaire published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Disaster to the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their status outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in ABC/Post poll that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than a government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two-week-long Des Moines Register/Blomberg's survey on Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans were frustrated with Republicans Congress: 54% are unsatisfied, 21% angry.
Jeremy Corbyn's first meeting at the Prime Minister's Survey
Corbyn’s first launch at the poll has been eagerly expected since his choice.
Jeremy Corby, new Director of Labour Labour Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister’s Survey.
Corby will ask about his first six questions shortly after a half day, and most likely both media and Labour Party MPs were watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has asked for this weekly show – less theatre and more facts –
He also said that he could leave part of the opportunities to treat his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership after he was appointed to the Shadow Board and spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Trade Association on Tuesday.
At the same time, the president of the Labour Party’s decision to stand quietly during the national song in the memorial service held on Tuesday, which was held in the Battle of Britain on the 75th anniversary of the World War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s MPs and appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn’s representative said his “seriously speaking” of the “sacrifice of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.”
Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twin Newsnight program that he would have urged the president of the Labour Party to sing a national song despite his view that the king's room should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn’s inner circle, appealing to differences in economic, defence and external affairs, and initially under six parliamentary parties supported him as a leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in terms of the status of the party in the European Union and the government’s aid ceiling have been \"possessed, including within the working party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Central Trade Associations, that the Labour Party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Labour and Pensions of the Shadow Government, said that the party was “very clear,” as regards the fact that they only object to government plans to drop the ceiling from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth president of the Labour Party, whom David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The president of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics, and now he says that he has \"grouped\" ideas to the Prime Minister and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, a representative of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister’s polls is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both bullying and suffocating, instead, focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government’s Secretary of Finance Angela Eagle works as his substitute for polls when Corby does not participate – for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, John Bercowia, on the topic.
When Cameron came to the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further from a political theatre that is often linked to the Prime Minister’s polls, but he later had to admit his failure.
Since the launch of television in 1990, the Prime Minister’s poll has been an important measure when assessing the leadership’s discretion, the management of his sub-room, and his position with other representatives of the people, although critics have criticised the polls that they have become only a picture that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Collegeless young people are trained as photographers
It is difficult to be homeless in Johannesburg.
However, the group’s former street children have found a way to learn the skills and make a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is an unprofitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and gain profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who completed the first project.

The value of the Pound rises in the UK's wage growth
The value of the plot jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and July, Britain's wages, including bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009, and was considered to be accompanied by an assessment of the increase in courses.
Pound rose to $1.5505 and 0.84% against €1.3330.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 percent increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the market's most distinctive share and rose by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would combine two world’s largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9% after a competitive luxury group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and in addition, they showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the miner said it had collected $2.5 billion by launching shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Packing and paper group Mond's shares were the biggest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the form of \"sales\".
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sports survey company announced its half-year income before taxes: 83 per cent increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports says higher wages can harm enlargement
Peter Cowgill, President of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the UK, it can mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.”
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company,” Cowgill said.
The costs could be targeted at the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash begins a grass root campaign against the intrudement of Aldin
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA shops from Aldin's attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass root campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first trade in early next year to South and West Australia, with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food brokers and build IGA brands through mainstream and social media marketing and through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped along, and brands like the ice cream producer Simmo's, from Dunsborough, offer taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises annual investor strategy day.
There is a great deal in the game, as South and West Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores, with a higher yield margin than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcash.
In South and West Australia, visitors are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food markets in these two states within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million per year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open in the south of 25 and in the west of 30 movements, which will generate a turnover of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Sale and loss of food and food at Metcash’s high fixed costs can cost Metcash around $113 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in Eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said in a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could possibly be lost in a decade.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Board of Metcash would have contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the outputs of Metcash's food and food business, which conveys products to about 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012. This is about reducing the debt financing of operations when pressures are being put on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler has maintained half, and has invested more than $150 million per year, counting the prices of hundreds of products per week to the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair stores by adding faster growing fresh food, as well as by placing a better range of private brands on the market.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, says that the price reduction and the improvement of shops have increased attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the road of growth in revenue in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Union, supports Thanasi Cooking
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer by side in the recent storm, which has grumbled around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism from his own conduct, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Association.
The talented two-year-old Kokkinakis, called the Social Ks, was unwittingly exposed to a case where Kyrgios was irritated by Stan Wawrinka in Montreal Masters.
Soon thereafter, in the flooding battle in Cincinnati, the judge was forced to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: “Wawrinkan should have hacked Kyrgios, and I should hit that cocoa.
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his May after the crash ruined his potential profit from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been an invincible defender of Kokkinakas.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from the second place in the doubles with Bernard Tomic, Davis Cup in the semifinal against Britain.
“I’m pretty strong at the idea that Thanasi has just been drawn to the crash,” Healy said.
He broke his mail in the US Open because of the crash, but he's not the first player to break his mail in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, also in some provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a nice team around him, he's got a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature in 19 years of age, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is valued in the dressing room, he exercises hard, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merit.
Healy has also been in favour of the decision not to join Kyrgio in the important games that start on Friday, I described this joint decision as a solution to everyone, but still supporting the Canadian return to the team's stables.
“We want the team to be fully focused on games and not everything around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, and has made some terrible mistakes in the public, and earned some terrible criticism that he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public reflecting on these consequences.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared an exceptional state and closed its southern border against Serbia, holding those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of fleeing the flow of migrants coming to the country.
The border followed chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered in an unbiased area, and the Serbian authorities react at a sturdy time.
People who fled the violence in their home countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on the road for an indefinite period of time between the inspection stations of two countries.
However, the decline has increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants threw out the border and shouted insults to Hungarian mercenaries.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is “unacceptable to accept” the return of migrants from Hungary when they are constantly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause harm to civilians.
The debate must be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion between Hungary and Serbia was established after the 28 national groups failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers who have now occupied Italy and Greece. Ministers hoped to speak about the conclusion of the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demand an extra EU summit for the next week to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and, where possible, to close you and speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the aid is ready for Serbia’s border, the country will also set its border against Romania to stop the flooding of migrants through the country.
The CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finalize the lead wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and place of arrival in the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life and not those fleeing from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary are now determining the crime of the company beyond or harming a 4-metre (13 feet) of the silicon wire fence, built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government announces an emergency,” said Dr. Zoltán Kovacs, the president of the government, who told journalists in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing the border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the deployment of the soldiers expected for the next week, but the suppliers of Associated Press at the border have seen a heavy armed military staff with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakosi, the security advisor to the country of Orban, said that the authorities had captured 45 people when they tried to cross the border, and 15 already further to the land.
They got over the fence, they are now imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of crimes defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
In Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the border against Serbia after they had sent a train car hidden on the pitch line to close one of these places.
The main border crossing area near Hungary’s Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal bag for people’s handling, and the crowds were intrusive.
About 20 got in, but thousands were out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton continues in a two-digit leadership in the Democratic Nomination Contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders is blackmailing him.
Clinton now supports 47% of Democratic voters (calculated 58%) and 27% of the second Sanders (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is worth 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choices more stringently than other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has fallen among several population groups since the last month’s CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly led by women and moderates, but his leadership is narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s first trip to democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and now he’s at levels with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads to older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digital century with liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percent.
About half of the country's democratic voters say they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be excited about his support.
The thoughts are more confused with those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
Where 48 percent of democratic voters say that they are eager to support Clinton, the Republican First Man, Donald Trump, is said to be a rare Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as candidates, the most popular response was that he had a suitable experience (16%), and the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice President has an impact on the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him already involved in the race - although the third disagrees.
When asked who they would choose to appoint the party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue democratic candidates, Hilary Clinton’s leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden leaves, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this measuring tree, Biden stays far away, but the proportion of those who keep him more vocal has grown.
When the democratic voters were asked what is most important in the candidate, however, they raised opinions on the front of the vote.
In the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Candidates of Democrats or potential candidates are well-functioning in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do the best of the triangle in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say that Clinton is not honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agreed.
When we look at all these things, about a quarter of democratic voters say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server use as a foreign minister continues to raise questions, most democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation and says that it did not affect their general interest in him.
However, it is different to consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
In March, people’s opinions were distributed shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email polemicism did not affect their overall preferences about Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion on him has deteriorated.
More than six of the ten Republicans say their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton’s own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters in the whole country do not regard Trump as honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered well leaders.
Six of the candidates involved in the study, Bidenia, Carsonia and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion about him, just like Carson.
An error margin of 6 percentage points in a study involving 351 democratic voters.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump's National Survey
Ben Carson comes to Donald Trump near the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the pedestrian.
Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% to 27% of the survey published on Tuesday in the last month's Fox News poll.
However, Carson rose from six percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is removing Trump from higher-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% of the current 2 percent of last month.
Former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are at levels of 6 percent.
The error margin for this latest survey in September 376 is +/- 6 %.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's rise in polls: he has 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump is 32 percent ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was much ahead of Carson.
When Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgery for vain, even though Carso apologized to Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday at his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died in a fraternity simulation ceremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the University of Baruch College in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, were brutally attacked by Chun-Michael-Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his visit to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied up and his back was loaded with more than 13 kilos of sand, after which he was repeatedly beaten to the ground when he tried to walk through a rigid field toward the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head would get hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Brotherhood members didn't call the emergency number after Deng's fainting, but, according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change the clothes of Deng, to search the network for information about his symptoms, and to contact the National Chairman of the Brotherhood, Andy Mengi, asking for advice, Commissioner Chris Wagner told the press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and in practice, they set up brotherhood for Michael Deng’s well-being,” Wagner said.
Deng wasn't given up, and he died the next morning.
According to the report, Deng received repeated boring objects on his head, body and journey.
“There have been a lot of families suffering from brotherhood when at least one student has died every year since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
The great jury in the Monroe County supported the fact that the first five members were charged with the murder of the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, will also be accused of violence and criminal plots.
“We do not only want to be responsible for individuals. If there is an organization behind what happened, which officially or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held accountable,” Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood.
This is what happens when the central bank of the United States increases interest rates
The increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising courses will fall, the earnings of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it’s going to be or how long it will last.
The past does not help with the timing of what comes specifically to the economy.
The result of the recovery has been only 11 months since the first pick, sometimes it has passed as long as 86 months.
The ECB’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has been often, although not always, a determining factor in how economics and financial assets react.
Therefore, the officials of the Central Bank of the United States have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are beginning to increase, but mainly on the development of the time to normalize the situation.
There are indeed a number of variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants can find that all the congestion associated with the interest rate has been overstated.
“The first increase in the global economic crisis after the Central Bank is inevitably interpreted in some circles to end the 'bad money' era,” said the main economic expert in Capital Economics, Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the progressive return of US interest rates to normal, even though still low, to a level of revolutional shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of previous developments:
As the market has been seen in the last about a month, waiting for an increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
When an increase becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what is going on after the central bank increase.
In particular, in the last about 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14 percent when approaching an increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly flat (average 2.6%), and after 500 days, the average yield has been achieved in six last cycles at 14.4%, Nuveen Asset Management is reported in a recent analysis of the capital strategy of Bob Doll, which was published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when profits start to fall.
Guarantees are part of the economy, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been encountered before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is, in particular, a gross domestic product that will be closest to the lowest level of all time before the central bank’s subscription.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118% annual nominal annual GDP was less than 4.5% since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe it to be permanent when the third quarter has advanced by 1.5 per cent, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank says.
The rise of interest rates in this fragile economic arrangement can be risky and raises the question of whether this is different, Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been prepared to raise the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the future trade forecast only 25% probability.
“Our research shows that from 1950 onwards, all increase cycles have been present in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed the peaks ahead of the recession very quickly after the recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession that has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting for the most extreme of the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now running for 74 months.
A fixed return has also been unstable in the market when waiting for an interest rate, and the model reminds some of the capital observations.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects appear faster in bonds than shares.
The trend of debt returns appears to change immediately with the first increase/departure of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on debt records will immediately decline,” Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a convergence in the yields of longer and shorter-term debt books, thus balancing the rate of return.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although we are still cautious about finding profit, Schwab’s solid yield analysis in a analysis by Kathy Jones.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
“In addition to the downside of the Doll’s strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the rate of return is more stable, the credit margins have increased and the uncertainty has increased - all these are specific to the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will be more expensive than they have funding.
“Historia shows that ‘quality’ shares are generally more productive in the three months after the first rate,” the Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover bypassed low turnover companies after 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares completed better than low-quality companies. First of all, the average number of companies was 4 ( percentage points) and the latter 3 ( percentage points).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock exchange, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
In addition, savers can gain profits with higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says.
Commissioner for Conservatives Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of recording.
He argues that its separation from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
He also took the BBC Music Awards Awards, saying that they were just mimicing British Awards
Commissioner Dame Collins criticises The Voice, saying it's not original either.
The BBC Radio 3 is turning into a Classic FM, claims to be a leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an effect on its content, and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
\"It depends on the fact that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term \"feeling sense\" - is turning into Classic FM,\" he said.
He also took his goal at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The last year’s BBC Music Awards seem to be just a British Awards galaxy under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that I remember directly about when you actually copied something that you already found on the market, Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is above a lot of commercial competitors in terms of live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is actually first class.
“In my opinion, it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Previously this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey claimed that the channel had to work more than before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer that was criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Democratic President of the Tory Party Damen Collins criticises The Voice, the music competition BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, according to estimates of 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George were starwives, was produced in the BBC style.
He added that he wanted the production company to find success inside his own house – the next time it starts a entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future The Voice periods from being produced, or to impose on other forms of entertainment that would be used by the subscribers.
Online sales rose at least in August, Black Friday might be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase after the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may slow down consumption
The act of virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of the UK’s shopping scandals into ghost shops.
However, experts say that there are now signs of e-sales in the air as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
The total consumption of August grew at least after the start of statistics in 2000: only 5% increase from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a level of online sales in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If the growth levels of previous years are considered and returned to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMGI index, Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people bought online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it is levelled, and (growth) can decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been regarded as one of the reasons behind slowing shops.
Experts believe that consumers will slow down purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average average of five times more buyers flocked to their computers to pick up the shops by pouring many traders’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allowed buyers to argue about the findings, can control the purchase.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as television and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made in online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using shopping chains.
Muslims bury Mecca in a nostril accident dead, to the Bin Laden family sanctions
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through streets during the first funerals in Mekassa
Saudi Arabia has partially accused Saudi Binlad Group of collapse
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the pickup box collapsed.
29 The dead were carried through the streets in the air, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the uprising broke up in the big mosques of Meka.
In the main, the white-dressed dying filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The sad passage passed through a sacred place, where only a few days ago the pick-up cucumber fell through the mosque's roof and poured down the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden’s family’s family as a result of a disaster, where 394 people were also injured.
The killing of the rebels in the Meka’s great mosques was carried through the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, the territory of Manchester, and he was the first pilgrimage to collapse.
Akram had been in a major mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual break-up.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the break in Mekaka will continue when thousands of people arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binlad's Group should not have left up the guard when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version said that the Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s leaders were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the fall of the pick-up cucumbers to the yard of the major mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the hair-sucking election this month.
Binladin Group has not published communications on the collapse of the cucumbers and has not received its representatives for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are ten-fold lifting cucumbers around the Meka major mosque, which are part of a huge construction plot led by Binlad Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s reigning family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s senior leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son whose family banned in the 1990s.
Romahus occurred in a windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities imposed a million fines (174,000 pounds) on the families of the deceased and permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q-pomo says Eastern Europeans working cheaply are behind popularity
The British increasingly use assistant services, says Veronica Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, the Schrewfix shops for professionals will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint pennies and hire more skilled Eastern European workers to do homebuildings
It seems that if you're with a hammer, or if you're going to paint the walls, you're in a minority now.
The British are increasingly hiring assistants to handle tea-to-be work in their homes, says the company’s boss behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the Kodinremont trade chain, said that behind the popularity there is the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for employees and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in trade are made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more single women's economies that make more housing than before.
Laury said: “A large part of the staff of our stores is still men.
We must seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the only five women leading the UK FTSE100 index, and he has reconstructed his leadership team so that there are as many male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group of women, including its CEO and the financial director.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision - a difference is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher announced a decrease in both six months’ outputs and sales after the group took the cost of closing the shops.
As a result of Trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening up 200 new stores
The three-season government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee organisations began to force the same way, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that there is a sense.
Let's ask if it's worth a break when it's going bad.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already announced that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but go to work.
This would have been impossible in the old time of good consensus.
Of course, there was no net where to protest, but openly declaring as a wealth would have been a political suicide of a small person.
A million-member trade unions in a few tens of thousands of human protests do not slow down, but it gives the cause of thought.
The position of the trade union is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have been running on their own for years, they are finally allowed to defend, appear and properly.
The government may, therefore, want to capture the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary.
Let’s be honest about the organization’s actions, and it’s a mess that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has been stopping for a long time.
For example, industrial production has been down for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decrease and unemployment rises.
I think these things would force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard savings: The objective of 8.5 million savings, the reduction of staff by 130
The University of Lappeenranta will start a savings fund with the aim of getting the cost paid by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings of the University, the entire staff-related yt negotiations, with a savings target of 6.5 million each year.
In practice, it means a reduction of around 130 employees.
Other activities will also save two million.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It also affects the budget cuts made by the government.
During this accounting period, the University will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the same funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other funding will be EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass education and research cuts and the reduction of corporate finance with our university is very significant, says Professor Anneli Pauli at the University’s press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts were even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland’s railway transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to open up to competition gradually.
The first is the direct traffic in the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
There is a long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The central bank of the United States must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the page when the central bank of the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
As Reuters asked 80 economists about half of those who believed last week to raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historical event because when the central bank cut the interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero levels and to start normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively well-functioning, and recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance sheets and created a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to pick up, but the signs show that they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting her colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was “insolently guilty of first murder, and hoped that he could cancel it, the authorities told them on Tuesday.
The Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Delta State University's geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called the emergency number about 10 in the morning.
On Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, “he killed his wife last night, and also mentioned that there is a “soul dog in the house,” which “does not disturb anyone, but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for shooting.
When the police arrived there, the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a message written by the 45-year-old Lamb, read: “I am so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing a message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed his historian Ethan Schmidt before he eventually killed himself on Monday in a police circle.
William LaForge, director of the University, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “there was clearly something in the mind of Lamb.”
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite claims published on Monday that Lamb had believed that Prentis was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no “lawful information or evidence,” there was no evidence or evidence.
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentis for about seven years and described him as a \"good man.\"
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who has been shocked.
O'Steen told me that Prentis and his daughter were \"the best friends of all,\"
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentis worked at home online. According to Sun Heraldi, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentis, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them he's not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's highway on the 1st near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argues about educational science from Delta State in spring 2015, says the list of credits found on the University’s website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
It all really requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double break
Luke Shaw got a double break in his right leg in the defeat of Manchester United to the PSV Eindhoven in the league of the Masters.
Even though the defender remained tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw would be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by the death penalty of Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture on his feet and now he’s in the hospital.
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at age 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double break takes at least half a year, and he doesn't play at the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a punishment shot.
He did not punish Mexican player Nicola Rizzoli.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian supplier was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was really bad for two feet.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.

The British defender has an additional incentive for recovery next June’s European Championships in France.
Philly Cocu, a PSV coach, said: “It’s a really bad injury.
If a player gets out of this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to insult the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played against Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because it’s not intended to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it’s bad,” Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
Moreno said to SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry.
The PSV Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris S Modeling challenged him.
You think David Cameron knows Lorax better than that?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long before it learns almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the child care service of the holiday time asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax book, a environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “The fun, moving, creative and includes a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or a message we have never seen before.
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the book’s plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to a rather short original text.
In the town of Tarville, where all nature has been lost and even the air is commercial, Ted’s son hopes to win his dreams on the heart of the girl by filling Audrey’s desire to see the right tree, the text says and describes the love story, which Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, was not written by Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds like it was taken from the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database page, which starts with: “In the town of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, Ted’s son hopes to win his dreams on his side of Audrey’s heart.
Bearing in mind that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he had been such an unexplored book. There a young, anonymous son hears how the local nature has destroyed greed, the wood beating, and the need-sleeping Kerskanen, without caring for the short, five-way creature Lorax, which is called for trees.
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably excluded to an assistant who has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron’s election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think the last 3-0 serial destruction is likely to be repeated.
I wouldn't shut down the guest butter from the bills.
The Alastair Cook side can be less experienced than a three-year-long team, but it involves good tourers and the team’s way of thinking is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, only young positives.
Moen Ali develops in his spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an offensive option, although there is no known factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the British cricket team, his replacement becomes Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is quite difficult to analyze for me, because I am his chief coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but bitter truth is that cricket players are criticized on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the press, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About 100 points more, and Lyth’s season in the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more running for Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
The English chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team singer.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the bat will be left behind.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play at home and at guests.
The only issue of the complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean when Lyth was in the top state, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and it's got a hit I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of something we saw early in York, when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this, of course, depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moen in a shot-off against Cook, when an extra passer would be placed on the field but might be held at four speeds, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the batter couldn't hit it there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be a pretty cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in the counties in Worcestershire, but he is a third of them, and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first fall before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a thief to the team, and, the little I have done with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can watch his unremarkable statistics - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and thinking it's a gambling game, but there's not too many feeders on offer, and the electors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan batter M chain Jaywarden as a consultant to the games can prove to be a neronism.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the games of the white ball, bringing with him both energy and an unsatisfaction.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international critiques, then it was playing or coaching, and he’s got the same stuff to make use of as Mahel.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the trainers and the elect do not make timetables.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can lead to profit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron’s mid-term renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing increasing problems from day to day, even if it does not take into account even the heartfelt Jeremy-Is or not- Corbyn’s choice of leadership in the working party or the anger of the central trade union organisation in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigerian Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is in so deep a variety of crises, which are not all the reasons for it, some Member States have become tired of the self-centered agenda of the UK, which is full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not wish to do most.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Trade Association decided that it would not want them even if they were to shake social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfiegend.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local spectacle, and then come home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwardly within the UK's EU-axis - \"Don't leave us alone with France - it is said from Berlin - suggests that the shortst-looking ministers and officials of certain capital cities are now at the point that they don't care if we leave.
German careful and moderate Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his action before it is ruined in the same way that it took place for far too long for the delayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing power, too.
Poland can soon have a national right-wing government, a left-wing country in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice for self-determination, when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of the same separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even plan to make useless comments to the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process.
The new negotiations had been held, and the new negotiations had nothing to do with Britain.
Europeans have had a bitter experience in how the newspaper of Fleet Street could be and how the exclusive powers of the EU-Septic Press are, what they were not inspired by Tony Benn during the 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was strengthened in the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for themselves by writing the “EU direct bananas” when Brussels was a letter exchanger in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband was a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They were included in a bookable set of tax-responsors, telephones with hacking foreigners, as well as persons whose place of residence is literally elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them the same way, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a lusty gorilla, bananas must be handed over because of a riot if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairistic than Blair himself on the basis of a renegotiation of Cameron, namely, Bair had admitted to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving Blair an exit situation.
The press never forgiven him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at Westminster's parliament building on Monday (I told him that he no longer had time to waste on me) would seem to be in danger of reinventing Neil Kinnock's 80s boycotted Murdoccha strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it can take time, he must, however, develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC warship Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, in a beautiful way, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the UK's independence party, Ukip's military initiative, as well as the most charming nationalists of the Conservative Party, will certainly be able to put this opinion behind.
Hilary-Benn, but not Benn-fani – Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his internal patrolman would have wanted to admit that Corbyn’s choice to appoint a Karski John McDonald as the finance minister of the Shadow Government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father-in-law was suffocating in TV, trying to be inconvenient to his colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his position of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight to stay with, in any situation, in which, the Penn Clause, was not what McDonald said, and, in all circumstances, what Corby said to the principals and the representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corby wants to convey (revelation that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the period of the 24-hour TV, and in particular in the social media cycles, which are an acceptable growth platform for the persecution and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the working party in the referendum campaign to be self-evident.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the basic cycle of McDonald and Corbyn regarding membership of the EU (and therefore in line with their Benn-a spirit-controlled economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers for whom the narcisism of small differences is central to dogmi in narcissism.
As for his two divisions with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby's campaign is not to be handed over), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their leaders.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital (they also have suspicious voters) to the UK when it can be completely useless?
The United States has somewhat disappointed the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the cost cutting conservative government is in power, as I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England’s Electric Tobacco Assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric tobaccos are 95% less harmful than traditional ones had started with a meeting of 12 people, some of which had connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts who wrote British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet’s evidence of electric tobacco used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report.
The PHE published its report on this activity last month, describing it as a cover for evidence.
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet published a medical journal attacking the PHE’s chief executive decision on the basis of an exceptional whore.
Two other researchers in BMJ have wondered if the claims were built on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.
They say that the public expects that PHE’s claim “the best estimate in the current case” is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco – is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people developing a multi-resolution analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages of products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO has previously received funding from the British American Tobacco Company for independent research.
He also supported BT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not from Philip Morris International, who had previously received a tobacco company, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also indicate that they have received funding in the field of research.
Others are not known for their experts in the control of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The group’s research, which has been produced in a purely clear way, admits that there is a lack of undisputed evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that “there is no evidence that electric tobacco works as a route for smoking in children or non-tripers – is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims in BMJ have been answered before.
He says: “The tobacco is significantly less harmful than burning.
Half of the people who have burned their lives will die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to explore long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence looks like and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of smoking-related illness every year and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence, that is, although electric tobacco is not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC should give up East Enders, says former Channel 4 Director.
Former Channel 4 spokesperson Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as East Enders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give anything – from the bridges such as the soap series on this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that license payments should only be used to implement programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticises the BBC for putting public-service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After President Tony Hall of the BBC said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said he experienced Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC in vain.
“I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and send programs that would clearly agree with unsubstantiated competitors,” Johnson said, as part of its research on the future of the BBC.
If the license fee is held - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that other people don't do and do.
The Voice will be sent to the most important time of delivery, as it is expected to receive as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else looks like a program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why the regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of those, and the East Enders is the other, without denying it within the house.
In fact, other channels would give anything about it.
I do not understand how this is about the transmission of public service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
In 2004-2010, the serial entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is guilty of hunting the numbers of viewers, because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
His comments on the BBC's most popular series resemble the comments of former Sky's leader Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sells such series as East Enders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s smaller public service programmes go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC fulfils its responsibilities, and then can, by defending the 4 billion pounds of license payments, say “I think we are doing all these unknown programs that no one sees.”
They'll put them in a place where no one will ever look at them.
Johnson said to the Committee, “I have been looking for you to find a more regressive system in who will get the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year will get a lot of value, but I don’t know if it’s true for people who have £150 in a lot of money, because they don’t use the BBC much.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its role as a Reith for information, training and entertainment.
He said that only a small part of BBC’s production is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be taken as a model from the Australian and Canadian radios and changed to the form of the task to inform, educate and entertain.
As regards the partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says are shown on television only by some people, and join commercial companies in such a way that all of them can be viewed online.
-Mänigenetics – enables brain cell control with audio waves
The video shows how the shuttles change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
Small shuttle birds change the direction as soon as they hit the sound pulse, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membranes that respond to ultrasonic exposure.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called voice genetics. In it ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which electrical impulses are flown into human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Scuba birds don’t normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles confirmed the ultrasound waves that then go into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4-ionic channels, structures in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves allow these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, according to the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic control shuttles, Chalasani modified worms genetically so that part of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasonically modified slopes, the microcircuits confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the trips where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The process has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that gives scientists the opportunity to connect the nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that there may be some advantages in the use of sonogenetics compared to optics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent from the optical fiber along the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unobessively, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it can be possible to get the target human nerve cells to react to ultrasound in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Unlawful torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisers may be ashamed of British arms trade
See Amnesty International’s anti-arms video.
Horrible killers!
Neck-breaking legs!
Robbery bombs!
Both electric bending pumps that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
The joyous voice and the comics are no doubt that this world’s largest arms fair is a sharp parody, produced by Amnesty International to emphasize the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for the oppression governments at the ExCeL Centre in London.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared on bus stops and metro trains, which require more accurate access.
“The important information is that you travel on the DLR route on 15-18 September – one is asked by using London’s underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
In September, a flock of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruise Designs (in the museum of public plans).
A collective called Special Parol Group helped spread posters around London using “Ad Space Hack Packs” packages. It consists of six pounds of six-ply-to-a-a-third of the entire planet’s bus stop advertising space.
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorized “public vandalism”
One of the parody inks produced by the Special Pachol Group.
According to Cruel Designs and the University of Essex Journalist Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wishing to take political work to external audiences.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the counter when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arm trade poster greets business travelers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been watched through Facebook over the last 24 hours and created by VCCP for free, as well as the graphic designer and background photographers worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that gun fairs were not advertised at all - and also in ExCeL's calendar there was an empty point - and thought: \"Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid --
They played with the idea of a more realistic, dark-minded corporate advertising, but “it was more urgent to stress the matter with bright colors and animations.”
“They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fairs,” says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture means are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fairs comes from the inside of ExCeL, when the exhibitors trade fantasticly decorated products.
In his press release, he received an order from the U.S. Army from the AT4CS RS on the other hand.
This includes – an original-quality pipe-lifting tool that focuses on excellent effects on the back of the panzer inside the destination.
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Apartment
It's been 11 years since I was unconscious when I moved to a student apartment, and then I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles of the people I've irritated - and numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up into eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be anything completely scary to the nerves.
It is attractive to talk about where you are at home, whether you like the middle year and where you think about Corbyn, and why I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just hypnotism in HAHAHAHA me to find in my room.
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, and not those you don’t want to talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they’d split off the triggers.
Give people room.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail calls, movie stores, and luxury entertainment lessons, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting a university while you’re in a relationship
University is a tough place for Introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments form a culture of walking from the room to the other, which is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who tries to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say, “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but now you have to leave that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.
Try to understand when a student is tired of socialization and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When the speech came, knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start a university in the top season of bakery, knocking people in the doors with a chocolate sandwich and showing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less-healthy to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when asking you personal questions.
Providing self-determination is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and they may be in the future to connect your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on how you can bake.
Badly mixed flour-cooker fat cells are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk on your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is possible that they will give you permission, even though they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adultly than my flatmate, which mixed the detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not be reminded that people should not sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that eloquent cat.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music later, because the clock was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase volume.
When they finally shut down at five in the morning, the girl kindly allowed them to sleep two hours before putting their own music to a break, locked their doors and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to change the same apartment with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be incredibly awkward if you considered a roommate partner as your future spouse, beat up together, split up, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what you want, but if you really don't have a future spouse, you could even try to make sense of your bottom.
In that thrilling moment, when you find that someone has left his keys to his locked room, the border between snoring and bullying is thinner than it does.
A good stick is fun, but it'll be canceled in a moment.
You can provide useful and fun teaching for safety by hiding something - but never mess with someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into the water glass, which you then put into the freezer, but don't put their property on a blue floor like it's twice.
Racist attack on Kite - The house that was designed for reception center was suffocated in Salo
A racist attack on Kite in North Karelia was carried out on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police said earlier, this is not the accommodation of minors, but the sleeping mats of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, the teacher of the Evangelical National School of Kiten.
The windows and walls of the residential facilities of the National University were clogged with racist signs, such as hawks, and a metal object was thrown through a single room window, says the East Finland police.
According to Luukinen, the responsible teacher for social security education at the university’s youth school, the building under the illustrative authority was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some may be elsewhere,” says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are occupied by the National School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as under-age asylum seekers who have only arrived.
All those who are in a messed-up building have a-stations.
Part of a study at an adult school, part of professional studies, and part of a study in Finland, says Lukkainen.
A status is so-called a continuous residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time for a foreigner already in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an injury and a breach of domestic peace.
According to Luke, it was held to students on Monday at the information conference, where the necessary interpretations were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one wants to leave.
We have had another decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have been at least three men and they were on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the top of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception.
The incident happened last week.
On Tuesday night, MTV told us about it.
The hospital’s wall was painted by a hakarist and written in English, “You are not welcome”
The case has been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9 at 16.02 corrected police information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will end the Y-jun to the Karelian Karelia - passengers in their nerves, \"from the idiots of the sky,\"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor’s Karelia ceases to pass in March.
The new one became angry with the passengers on the start of the train at Helsinki’s main railway station.
In particular, the downhill strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time, and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says he's coming to the capital with an interview video from HSTV.
There are also train changes in other countries.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nupplinna Tuusula is out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published on Tuesday information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The agreement period changes in the year-on-year and the cease-fire routes are in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be subsequently approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström considers that the public train cutter is short-looking.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and bypassing multiple stations.
The Espoolainen Annina Pöyry, on the train, made the fate of the city more remote.
“It’s really bad for those who need to redesign their journey,” he said in his pain in the Y train.
Small relief is promised.
A new train connection will be available for the Beach Beach, which will replace the Y-juna in the Helsinki Region of Transport (HSL), i.e. to the Church.
This brings additional costs to HSL, in practice, for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to carefully assess costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, the HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, the Ministry certainly much more than that.
The R line on the main track leaves two positions in between.
Instead, the number of trains in Ainola and Sauna Kallio doubles.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic from the routes of the Joensu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinjoki.
The Pieksämämäki-Joensu route will be shortened as a route to Pieksämäki-Varku.
Train routes are reduced by route to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made per year, with a total of about nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book The Currentity of the Capital: “Marxin is worth getting to know.
World economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his 1867-1894 final work on Capital, writing in a book published today by Yrjö Hakanen, a former president of GDP.
“He is now taken more seriously than a long time,” Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx’s estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrudement to all sectors of life, concentration of capital, and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly distant.
The book on the list of authors based on the main seminars organised by Hakaske is also found in the Aalto University’s professor, the prestigious economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current and eternal.
Is it not Marxian, however, the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Department of Economics?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences have distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and author of literature.
“The obvious notion is that the history of the wrong opinions of the dead men,” Korkman said.
It's true that Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions that take too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman considered.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical installation.
“The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he said.
Again, we are discussing Marxin’s interests, such as wealth sharing.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of a technical mullation, a changing world,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, Marx is worth studying with Korkman.
“In the 1970s, Marxia could not read,” Korkman said.
\"Mothers and Trotsky and other sects hated all capitalism, but more and more...
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also approach without the ideology and political weights of the years back.
“Every social scientist should explore Marx’s world of thought, as well as other classes,” Korkman says.
The United Nations demands war crimes in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, according to AFP.
The United Nations report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 was published Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils.
In the civil war in Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated to have died.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, a major attack by the armed forces should be examined properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lanka Armed Forces Report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women as victims.
The rebels, according to the report, have been accused of forced to fight for by-laws and children.
Both sides have reportedly committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court because foreign judges.
The English yo test was able to print social media.
Syksy’s textbooks had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which most of them had English.
His English skills tested more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, the substance could be written about social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media made us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of the 150-250 word in English could show the web page counseling board to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt responds to the Finnish Leelian lepo chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should look at things for young people as well.
There were four subjects to choose one.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, a third topic in the Swedish school of Porvoo.
In the third topic, it was only a sitat from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was Lybeck's idea.
It had to write a fire call, why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says, and estimates the whole experiment, “the noise is normal.”
In an English test in Finland - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, fell to the adaptation of the summer camel to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday there was also some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Autumn’s writings continue on Friday, when there is another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The tests are organised normally, i.e. the mood of the employees does not affect it.
The College of Colleges invites experienced people to search for appropriate connections in time in order to get to the trial.
You can also get an additional period if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
The trade in Oulu was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, the store was robbed on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the kidnapper had dressed in dark clothes and a comedian covering his face.
A man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to catch.
The case is being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police reserve tens of thousands of protestors arriving in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The government’s protest against cutting decisions will be blocked on Friday at the centre of Helsinki, predicting the police.
In advance, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akaja and STKK will meet at the Railway Agency at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out the alarming tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of the drumming.
Roads leading to the railway sensor will be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi's direction, traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi's traffic circle, westwards from Mannerheimit.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is becoming sub-parts from other countries of Finland because of the state of mind.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
“There’s going to be a lot, but, as a rule, we’re doing it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police call on us to avoid private car travel in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core centre.
A constant traffic is expected from the beginning of the morning.
With protestors from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki is also getting a lot of buses.
They will not be allowed to the Railway Authority.
Buses are in the distance from time to time.
The rest of the trip then has to go to the protest site, Kujala says.
It also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there is also a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings, is now partly self-defenced.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the state of mind to be calmly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local demonstrations are also held on Friday.
Friday's mental expression is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and mental expressions?
The big mental expression organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Heijaninen, a professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it'd raise your hands in front of the government, Soyinen says.
The very right government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also those that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s hard claims are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has the place to look at the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all earners for Friday's demonstrations.
The new is now the steep division whose mind expression creates amongst the one whose ay movement would want to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from different parts of Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, held in 1993, he said.
In the middle of the deepest sheep organized by the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (average) the government failed the labour market crisis.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government and the Ay movement are perhaps even worse than the time of the Murrostorst.
Besides, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland ever, Sohiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict in spite of the words of the Finns.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old labour force movement.
A number of thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The mood expression also stops public transport and potentially closes day care homes as well as schools.
While the demonstration of mind does not receive the undivided support of the employees, it can become the largest for years.
In recent years, around 300 protests have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're out of line.
Traditionally in the Finnish ay movement demonstrations, it has been quite peaceful - even though operating methods have become more difficult in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, are legal.
They try to avoid damage or destruction of property, the Soyinen says.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The spirit culture changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to put on pig shit.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, including pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
Metal and electric lakes of the 1970s
The 1970s were the most important warehouses in the metal lake in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
There were 70,000 metal men in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended at the meeting of the Advisory Board for seven weeks.
Metal men received a 16% salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused electrical losses all over the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people, many of the sheep unemployed, were gathered to show their views on the job.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers are opposed to the EU 1994 and 1999
Police were in the EU protest against farmers in 1994.
“Siperia teaches, the EU stops,” he said.
The farmers of Espa had a ton of snow.
The Helsinki European Summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hazes in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
A few deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
Tey threatened the strike and the arrests of the nurses in 2007.
At the end of the negotiations, the threat of mass extermination led to a result.
Doctors strike in 2001
Doctors in the strike - from the escape, included a statement by the law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted a five-month period and resulted in a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students march for student support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police finds out that the refugees are full of Finnish trucks for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of the refugee car registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the event in Austria,\" says Chief Commissioner Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling to the truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died with a strangulation.
According to the public radio that first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged, among other things, in restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreigner, about 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
Refugee long-term captain, former drug courier and uplifted businessman - the story of five smugglers
King of Upporich smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's good for himself.
For example, such people carry out human trafficking within the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and reporter Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers, and the book they wrote in Kuoleman travel agency will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present human trafficking hips, present solution proposals and present smugglers from different stages of business.
HS introduces five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the people of Tunisia are heading there for the summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in the chain, the burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more productive to transport people.
It has been done by Emir with a blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, there are 40 people.
One trip to Emir will make about EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of people wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as you can see fit.
Food is given so that customers are just and live.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer ends the money, it’s their problem.
We're gonna go to the water in the middle of the night.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea trip is hard, and in 20 metres high waves, passengers cry and throw up.
The human cargo has been bitten in half an hour, and Emir is leaving for a return trip.
Emir wants him to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the speakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police struck him once, he threw all his passengers over the line and told them to swim on the nearest island.
“I took customers out of the neck, and I threw them over the plate,” Emir says in a book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
They say he has to take this to the ground.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
It's a classic taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bofovasha, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter's engine is pulling at last, and it's seen the best of its days.
However, the main thing for Goran customers is that the taxi is moving, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bohovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres from Belgrade to lunch.
Located next to the village, there is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre, men who travel without their families will stay in tents, boats and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
In the forest, families who have not filed asylum applications for a reason or another have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia.
Some also stay in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Goran will find most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - via the Balkan route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in a difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
In the end, when they arrive in the region of Bogovasha, a great human trafficking hub, people are dying.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough, Goran thank you.
He said the Africans were trying to do the inks.
Goran doesn't like it.
Stupid fool all the way.
For example, the price will be set at 300 euros, then they will count to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran says he will work less than the others and will charge a ride to the Hungarian border for only EUR 50 per person.
The journey is one mile, most of the road is comfortable.
They say they're asking for a three or four-fold price.
Gora deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered the taxis not to be transported 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and the trails and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and turns away.
the Work of the Sneaking
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Cambodia, where there are many believers who fled the Congo, as well as a small center where the Congolese refugees are helped.
In addition to islanding, the Ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the messenger to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and takes care that the rubber tape of the white calarids throats in style under the low waist of the jeans.
The messenger is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call some of the five phone numbers of the Messengers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in the midst of the shoppers crossing the border.
In order to get asylum seeker or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, it must be said that there are, for example, war areas in northern Kiev, and that there have been violence in their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID card will be destroyed and the other will be acquired.
It helps with the contact of the Embassy with the Ugandan police.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum application procedure, NGOs, finally UNHCR.
A missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, the handling of documents to humanitarian organisations, and the migration process, for example, to a European country of 4 500-7 000 euros.
Foliot and Ice Plumbers
Tom's a starting smuggler, a former drug criminal.
The four-year-old Irish hit the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on his way to Britain.
He has been assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of trucks who don’t necessarily even know he’s in a human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from someone in the center of Calais.
They drive A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go to prison directly for the organization of illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years due to drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across highways to a resting place where the driver sleeps before they continue across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on the way to England, not even the Netherlands, and to cut the safety guard.
It must be done quietly so that the driver does not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the run, but then the mouth is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps up his client's aluminum foil, the same thing that is wrapped in the kitchen around the baker or oven potatoes.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner from detecting the hideer.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver will not blow up the smugglers at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The Upporic Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the Illustrations of the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is luxury sports: Turkish ports are rented for a few days to visit American or European family-friendly tourist trips.
In reality, ships are loaded with bulking Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000, first from Istanbul to some port and sea in Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People are being landed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for signs.
When it is given, you have to get to the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep the whole trip hidden under the deck.
Seaguards can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomiting, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ferry trip after the expenses.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hire the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to manage the work for himself.
During the summer season, transports will be held at least hundreds and Küçük will earn millions.
He said he bought over 100 apartments from the country, the pharmaceutical company, and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He has disappeared since then.
Correction of 16.9.2015 at 15.10 p.m.: The book of the death travel agency will appear here, not next week.
American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and driving to prostitution.
Sports Illustrated published a book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came into the competitions in the top state and ran in the box for the second best time.
In the final, however, he was panicking.
At the beginning of the day, he ran and defended his leadership with a ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was erupted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
However, I was forced to cross the line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-way disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before Sydney's race, and he himself felt huge successes.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with other men.
He also called on his husband to accept his work.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on the luxury life.
One of the explanations of Favor Hamilton as a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had received in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two-way disorder.
The double life of the former star drink became apparent at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world’s statistical field at 3.57,40, but remained in Sydney’s Olympic final.
The world champion exhilarated when the union put Norway under the ski bowl: “Suoraselkäinen,” he said.
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of fit in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have voted for the entire summer and in the autumn of last year a sports contract.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multi-time world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian ski union decided to close Northug out of the world Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union had put a ski bowl under control.
Thank you for pointing the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he said.
The dispute between Norway’s ski union and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the nation team so that he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a covenant that also takes care of future generations, and does not give one athlete in solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the alliance had given Northug both financial and other special rights for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has very different rules than just because it is the best.
Northug released his own announcement on Tuesday, where he assured he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the world Cup, as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals, of which two gold medals.
He was part of the last winter in the band that won the message gold.
The driver's day is also celebrated in Northern Finland.
On Thursday, 25 September, stamps will be held in different restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Paisin translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that all high-quality restaurants have not focused on the metropolitan area, but on top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the thyroid nutrients and the organisation.
In northern Finland, the restaurant is held in Vaasa, Fondi and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, there is a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make one of the most important international events held in the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kahahava reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the newly owned Kauhava ex-sert.
According to the complaint, the region remains a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partners, namely the Finnish Erillisverts Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building group would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the former Airport School and the airport, which have not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre.
The report states that for the Kauhava field for the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the possible arrival of a foreign operator to the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition from the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The management means that the arrivals and the arrivals have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on journalists in the evening after meeting with all the presidents of the parliamentary parties in Mäntynniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all the participants.
He values that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to speak with confidence in the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria, as well as in Russia and the US, can also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Niinity is desirable in terms of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the issue of NATO was also discussed.
The president did not take a stand on the situation in the labour market.

The Early Education Office will announce further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a huge risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to reporters in the parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio phones will become.
Speakings are not always transmitted in the future on Yle channels.
If other channels are reported as a channel, then let's see.
This channel is now being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio call to the public.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complex and requires a further justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä survived.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20, both on TV1 and on Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
The Sipilä Takes A Big Risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television phone will not tell you more about the inward turn of the government.
Is it an effort to define public debate more strictly in their own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions of the public debate? asked by Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and let it define himself.
In the name of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these things will not be related.
It is understood that commercial media has become nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not advertising issues in democracy.
The task of media representatives is to define the objective of not taking political agendas into consideration.
The TV is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in a different way, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, it is necessary to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
There is a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be marked as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interest or general policy.
From the door to the door
In the upcoming speech, it is also important that what the Prime Minister leaves without saying, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we need to look closely at where Sipil is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutt, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to six, the TV call is a Sipile door-to-door bet, because this is how this can bring its own view up without the ringtones.
In this way, the public will receive a public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipily passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the risk is that the media interprets something wrong with the speech, because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to six, it is very important how Sipila appears on TV - a whirlpool of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If the Sipilä knows how to do it well, it can work.
The situation is different than when the government would inform something about it, because it is a person who speaks directly to another person.
This is what President Barack of the United States is doing on a regular basis.
Really exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be very exceptional to the citizens.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister will speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns feel comfortable with the tensions ahead of them.
The employees’ organisations organise protests and strikes against government action on Friday.
On Twitter, President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could keep his speech on the state of the nation in the representation of the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again, announces his challenge for Sipilä's dialogue.
Now is not the time for monologues.
Soon, half a year from the election.
You can't hide for the rest of the time, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on a hiking trip has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy's father updated his Facebook pages.
The Police Department of the Interior Finland also confirms the matter to the newspaper.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Last night, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanked all the people who helped him.
Thank you for these 10 contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was split closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed with the violent bullying of young people: You get angry
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and who was five years old with his family in Finland, has won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
The account has been downloaded videos where young people fight with extremely violent take.
Amirhani says she's disappointed in the bullying of young people.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other, and beat the eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that are caused by this when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in the region.
Namely, you're fighting on the streets of your head.
You make the life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has sites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
It's a little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are sometimes subject to racism, you will be charged with it yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go with that, guys.
Amirhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You'll get the anger I don't like myself.
You've got things pretty bad, and you're not gonna make them better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions Monday
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on Monday from its alternative savings presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the Government to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (average).
Mr Fjader believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKK and Ava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation to soften its position earlier.
Mr Lyly, president of the SAK, commented in short on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock and the need for contracts concluded by active parties in the place of forced laws.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, the Sipilä cut off the negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: A great demonstration threatens to choke - I think it's a little funny to put on a fist.
It's a little funny to put a fist in your pocket, if you already have a match paper, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods differ from the width of the employee camp.
Is it meant to scream at the government, or does it agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK will wipe out the sacred hatred of the Republic’s government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat also spread to wealthy people.
OAJ threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or daycare is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of the STTK’s STTK, Antti Palola (sd), appeared in agreement.
He said that he had contacted the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity block, which was required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (average).
Mr Fjäder (kok) immediately said that his so-called paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office did not belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the presidents told the country to stand on Friday.
However, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to open the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for wage earners, the SAK should be inclined to accept the 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations with the Sipilä Government.
The right hand of Palola, Director of the Social Impact of STTK, was previously the special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The Palola said the government’s ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Sattumaa or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of clean away from Finland's staggers, whose enchanting image of the ACP Marko Pirateinen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a match paper in your pocket.
Custom at 18:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again.\"
President Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duuma President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is a better Etyj father than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has started the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Etyj, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow the entry of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to be forced by the European Union, to attend a meeting - a matter from which the President would remind journalists.
It is estimated that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctios are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk declared.
Mongolia’s Russian delegation got complicated, so Naryshkin continued to hide Finland by thanking and thanking Mongolia for the different organization.
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (cook) who has already discussed Russian delegation.
The lock encounters a real playoff mirror: \"The models are tight.
In Hakamets, both of them are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets you will not see real goals.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night to go to the 3-year-old KalPasta.
The rise was masculine, for the silver group of the last season was the worst of two goals.
It was more than a million times a week ago.
The Blues, which had been taken on board by the peacefuls, had a round zero score, and the loss readings were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of the games are playing the same game as last year, Dragon Lahti predicts settings on the club pages.
Tappara has been formed by a pretty playoff button for the Ramadians.
In the past two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the final series of Luka.
On both sides, the solution is required for a decisive seventh race.
In the last season, the Luku took the series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose to three next side and passed.
There are no major changes, except in groups.
Both of the counter-attacks will have a lip shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the plugs, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Vision: The story begins with a terrible play
The sports director, Loutila, handed the chief coach to Rautakalli to an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone directed the Rocky film, where he himself played the main part.
The defendant sent a sensationally to the world champion of the heavyweight series, Apollo Creed.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Suola handed her to Pora as a restless ashtray.
The nameless and wooden baker has moved on to all the surprises of the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of Rocky-like nameless but tough subsidizers.
It was White Indian, Porin Matta and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-down games, players painted their heads red and cut the irony.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo was called Coach Neumann.
You've taken the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Hopela believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Essiens has built the devil in the hands of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have rotted waste in a remote area like Rocky pig feeds at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholman, and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way outside of the field.
Hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Colony Sean Conneré.
Rautakallio is one of the most popular performers in Rocky as Connery would have been in the 1976 originals.
There's nothing left of Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
Rautakallion’s game philosophy is not part of a rhythming and adolescence.
He appreciates a tough game, but there is a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Ässien Garret Stafford's tactice to the head of the Tapparan Jere Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don’t accept such a game and it’s not part of an ass-knit, and after the game, the Rautakallio hurried to the people of Satakun.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are gentiles, veterans, policemen, and cranberries.
There are no key players in the game age in practice.
No wonder the chief coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite narrow, and Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
I'm going to take a ride.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of Toola as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The current balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
I would not have liked to have written the next part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time in his husband’s direction.
Yeah, I'm gonna play my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Abilanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but for the first time, Olga plays in Tuuka’s direction.
Olga’s role in the early years of Abilna is the drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother Sirkka.
The sleek tsemppa and supports his son, although his father Risto (who present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I’ve met my real example of Sirka, the easier it feels to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and told me.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the drama is drama and the truth may need to be painted a little.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Autila would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was a flat and really hard.
It was quite a small probability that someone would really succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot about this youth before filming.
The parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how many parents really know what you're doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil story.
Olga was an everyday girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the top, he could have been in love with me.
According to Olga, over the past 10 years, he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project will not be afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now, the entire production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in ancient Israel often plans to drive home because of their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to take over the entire Heinola for a month.
They have taken us very warmly, asking only what streets and when they will be empty.
Iron Sky 2 was the most expensive performance film in Finland
The Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The descriptions begin in October in Belgium.
The director of Timo Vuorensola begins to photograph Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive performance film in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been in Jalmar Helander Big Gam.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over €100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma start in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios and last eight weeks.
Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been very relaxed!
I have such a relaxing file about the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie you should come up with.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience.
Originally, 8-10 million were planned for the film budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but there is also a big studio.
However, 100 million people would get caught in the film, because each aspect and the effects are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no loose.
Iron Sky Universe, the production company of the film, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowd loan on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
Among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green, and Vladimir Burlakov play.
Train or cool?
Big logos return to the shirts
The breasts of the Trendsters have recently decorated large logos.
Some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in his console.
Advertising a dropper or T-shirt was seen as a train.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so are the old, familiar sports stamps such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolity wave brush.
And as often as before, the funny and trendy limit is alarming: if something is already right, it begins to become irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, where the trenders surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey base collegen, it is already placed on the bottom of the cabinet, which is before which the manufacturer's logo is commanded.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas radar curtains, the game shirts of the favorite team and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
At the beginning of the jeans, the beginners' Calvin Klein logos are now cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the breast of Versace’s syscuses makes it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I didn’t feel like I was stuck in a tank hole!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove from the large-sized Zotov tank compartment for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he seems to be cursing about the banker car door in a very good atmosphere and not at least on the basis of their images.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the combat tank, but it was a front-end tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in there, looked around me, and came out in peace, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov, the Russian army's TV channel, explained in his exhibition the new technology of Russia, because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the cars, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely go to all tanks and all the front-end tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and rotive, but nothing like being stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba's novosteii radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photo of the alleged chat has been published, even though there were a total of 50,000 people in the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov’s chat started with the story of Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told of his extremities when he tried and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a follow-up, where the organisers of the exhibition told their views about what happened.
Everyone has become accustomed to the rapid jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his big composition, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.

The Kittilä mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland has been leaked.
The clean-up process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandal to its stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
At the bottom, the foaming process is neutralized by the enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped either to be reused as a process water or transported to the environment through the surface lighting field, as permitted.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour after it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leaking water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
There was no change in the substance in the environment.
The year was found in the round of inspection at the country-wide office.
The year has not been found to cause structural damage to the building structure of the pool.
The company reports that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns you to cut too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the IMF, largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization fled structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the contract system and unemployment security.
According to the Danske Bank’s headquarters, the structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of portable communication for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning of what should not be too cut.
Such are infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamäki says to the Economy.
The IMF also considers that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, rising to 0.9% next year.
Danske predicts that today’s new business forecast will continue to grow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was in small growth in the summer, Kuopopäki said.
It is possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the problem is just a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, under Satoru Iwata, who worked under the cancer, Tatsumi Kimishima starts working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for monitoring Iwata’s footprints, evaluates Ace Research Analyst Hidek Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being heavily involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
Finland is becoming more and more minors.
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.
The case has been reported, among other things, by Dagens Nyheter on his website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, that hundreds of minors are lost annually.
Juha Kannelmaa, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants are lost in the country under - year? - In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013 alone.
They disappeared 9.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and were lost in 11, Kannelmaa says.
In the light of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be a full age there.
In that case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and return to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were made in the event that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he said.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications that came alone.
There are no missing asylum seekers this year, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of lost people, he emphasizes.
What happens to those who have made a conversion decision?
They are also lost in the labour market, for example.
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered country seekers.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who asked about refugee issues at the EU's Home Affairs Conference, told us about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. Studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen for TV and radio production is now on sale.
Mikkoinen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional equipment in his field.
It was the first time I told you about the Nett.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer described for Betacam.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that you will find those interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but they are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are a lot of enthusiasts – collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to turn away from the current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the goods with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being handed over.
This is what I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio devices.
It is clear from the traces of chronic strokes that a man who made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited the box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskyla.
Traffic threatens to fall out of poetry worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's mood.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the time of the protest scheduled on Friday.
In the afternoon, you will find out if the traffic will stop all day.
President Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great on the field.
Night and day cuts are very bright for drivers, so government plans to cut the blues will create resistance.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport is almost entirely at stops in the metropolitan area.
According to VR, trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no road or long-distance traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be driven to the stations.
According to HSL, the majority of buses remain in a variety.
The members of the ACP are away from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the premier, HSL reporter Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says that HSL can’t say exactly what bus lines are going on Friday.
The employees’ organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, according to the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas - the teacher thought he had a watch for his own.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher thought he had brought a clock to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics to the production.
One of the teachers, however, kept the clock looking like a bomb.
The police were invited to appear, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the armbands.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the clock had been shown to be a movie bomb.
The clock is in the police custody, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital screen, between which there were leaders.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days by forced leave from school.
His father is angry with the incident and the American-Islamic Council of the country is considering whether the case is again one indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain - Labour Director refused to sing national singing
In the song, God is called to protect the queen, but Corbyn is a opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party MPs have also been united in the review presented by the illustrious press.
This has hurt the people, and Kate Green, a labour candidate, said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought that Corbyn should have joined the song.
In yesterday's memorial meeting, British Air Force pilots were honoured with the battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in enormous gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He stood with respect during the national song, and the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn’s choice as a party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who are afraid of his destitute moderate voters with radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, cessation of savings and increasing public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is to appear as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron's novel on Twitter for the week to become a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for the case.
South Lake Minnetonka's police have been investigating a week of family deaths in Minnesota Greenwood.
The five-year-old family was found dead on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shooting of his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Days of the Years
The family was found after the school was worried about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the Short family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of Houses and Successful Businesses
The investigation of the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siair is still underway.
The motive for blood vessels is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune’s interview, Short announced that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I have received 50 purchase offers from the company over the last 10 years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen among other things by the fact that Shortt's family bought a crazy house from Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
The house is advertised as a dream of a car dealer in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with a sufficient garage.
The case of the matter of justice
StarTribune said the family father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various presupposition courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, it was not removed from Shortt’s website from presupposing comments, and so they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, StarTribunen is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on the operation of Short.
Vesku Loiri offers cake coffee
In addition, the owner’s colony was awarded the Finnish Hippos month horse owners’ prize.
This is great, Loiri said in a good mood of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist’s legend, Loiri, was still confused with the success of Fabrice Duo in the Grand Competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loir, the master of the success horse, Korpi gets full work with the horse.
Pekka will determine where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loir.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star - the greatest gift made by the athlete of all time.
Montreal Canada’s superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about $6.7 million) to Montreal’s children’s hospital.
According to the hospital’s report, it is the largest sportsman ever made an individual donation to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canada eight years ago and $72 million a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than its $9 million year-on-year.
Subba receives a lobby with its name from the hospital.
Canadian players have previously helped local hospitals significantly.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other major hospital in the city, where the PET scanner needed for cancer studies was received at the hospital.
The Japanese cafe can order a wife for the evening - serves only the bikinis and the essus on its head
The theme cafés are a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat café, a canoe café, a vampire café, a fish café and now a wife cafe.
It hits lonely, seductions and hungers.
It's about Metro.
In Tokyo, the Ore no Yome (My Finnish wife) cafe can be ordered for the night of a wife or husband.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a customer’s spouse.
\"Puoliso\" is chosen from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just an essus and a bikini on her head, while the husband is in tight biking shorts.
The website offers all the information about length and weight of the spouses at all times as they prefer to sleep on the mattress.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the launch of attacks against car security
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, the information published by Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that around 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve car cybersecurity, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best security practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a significant component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS will cost approximately EUR 52,000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six ascending.
At last, the car starts to be in sight in Finland.
Ford published the RS data now that the car world’s views are at Frankfurt’s car show.
Ford’s new four-wheel RS accelerates in a 2.3-litre, 350-hov power engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 km per hour.
In Finland, there is also a price, initially it is said to be EUR 52,000.
The car is now available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you.
Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Auto Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, two new ones are certainly more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia is planning to capture the ever-growing street masturbating market.
The new Sportage created by Gregory Guillaume, a new European design leader, is more round than ever.
There has been a cent in between axles and external dimensions, and the car cracks the air more efficiently.
The engine range has its main characteristics, but it has to be added to the 1.6-litre turbo to develop 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportaga and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage comes to us in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats were in our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a new car.
Kia will conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Starting with 1.7-litre turbodiesels and 2.0-litre petrol engines, Optims are available.
In the next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farm begins.
Chisu returned to the ship - looted in a bold hammer suit
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have to look like an open neck hole.
The apartment presents a beautiful song star with a siro belt.
The total is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who became a mother has received a pregnancy kilos with a light movement and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be a year soon.
The singer released his first single album in August.
Back to the stage and before the general public, after a long break, I’m not really excited.
It has been a shame to do everything related to music, the singer says.
Chisu will publish his fourth album in Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother's style of obsessive resembling - now visible to the breast
Real-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives topics for one after another.
She introduces her pregnancy and bra in her sexy clothes, last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian from her husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the front of the breasts.
It exposes the skin-colored bras under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
The last time Kardashia dressed in an amatsonic maternity school was when she visited her friend for dinner in New York only a few days ago.
The status was emphasized by the black superstitutes.
The third special maternity care is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the show was on her pregnancy.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
Mano Leloup wanted to have an idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths of pure model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar gathered the six hard truths behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if in the previous period you had been living with top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
Every season comes into the field new, fresh faces that compete from work with concasions.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the property is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be immeasurably difficult.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but Paris says you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Fashion models and designers are constantly together, while operating as a support network.
When the fashion is over, the difference is fragile.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are so pale that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
The work makes models feel like they are actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
The models were in Tory Burch's show yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are being spent, where designers will reveal their next year’s design.
Roope Salmine, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Abitanta music in the movie.
Roope Salminen presents an Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta group.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm going to present 16-year-old guitarist Salmine laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before the descriptions, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it's very good that I'm just teaching her play style from the video.
I don't want to make a imitation of a person.
A man who trusts Roope Salmine and Dogs does not play a role.
The Punk-Maners come with a man in nature.
The stars, the stars in the punk period of the program, certainly, many saw the first taste, as well as if they have ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been a long-lasting thing, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main performers of a beautiful film directed by Tuukka Temose were announced today.
A nuclear group familiar to the band’s audience is still present to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumple Sipe Santapukki is presented by Teppo Manner, a singer from Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka from Temoo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salmine gave a hint of his coming wash last night, when he told Snapchat mysteriously to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new genre in Instagram that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the figs and jaws, has shaved his face into silopous, and painted his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have recently wondered how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about at all?
There is no need to talk to the people, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children can’t always understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and anxiety, he says.
However, if the child has encountered or heard of the refugees on television, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones older think he is afraid of.
It's not worth scaring yourself, even if you're afraid of yourself.
A small child is closely following the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves stay calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should talk to them if they think about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not doing well.
Parents, together with children, can wonder how our families are dealing with this.
Is the world a safe or secure place at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This can be useful for him in the future.
Janne Viljamaa, a social psychologist: “Keep your child to help you become weak.”
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermonic Pallosalamaa difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola got caught in the middle of Apila Pallosalama.
It only doubled the profits and the 2nd seasons until at the end of July the ruin occurred in the Tampere ruins.
Because the slave was initially suffocated, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his guard from the vet for the time.
The explanation for the exit was clear in the constellation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the slightest way to go, but it required two courses of medicine.
As Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light movement, Pohjola says he was happy with the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku in a record time after the second SE dam.
Apila Pallosalama was very pressured from the hiatus when it could only drive a few weeks normally.
Those things were understandable at the end of the process,” Pohjola said.
The coach assumes that a proper competition made a blade for the slave.
The horse must have moved on, and hopefully it would also have been balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When you haven't been interested in it, it could have thrown into the fat without the sick.
On a good day, the Ori has, on the other hand, broken up such a mystery that the opponents have been in their wonders.
At the speed of the game, the players don’t go to Pallosalama, which even removes warm-blooded rides.
In the North, there is a soft drink in Vermo.
However, it is different how Apila Pallosalama agrees to it.
It's pretty difficult at the time of departure, and you might wear it under the boom of the departure car and something like that.
I hope the slave would be calmer than Turun's departure.
Apila Pallosalama is also able to come from the neck, and we are going to drive it out of victory, coach's permission.
That's why you can't get rid of bad iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Vints come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became forced to upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple’s programs is more complicated than it seems on the top.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1% of the year-on-year, Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices slowed down the decline in energy.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed a slightly lower estimate of 0.2 per cent from a couple of weeks ago.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called basic inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2% cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation in the whole 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1%.
Most of the euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
Cyprus's inflation rate was 1.9 per cent at low prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% lower according to the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area's inflation continues to be a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the two-and-a-half-highest price rise in the medium term.
On average, the ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% for this year.
The next year, the rise will increase to 1.1%, the central bank predicts its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next recession in the United States begins at its fastest in less than a year, but more safely within three years after the country’s central bank of Fed takes a long time to raise its interest rates.
And in the financial market, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he should start the interest purchases this week and not later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed on at its fastest by next autumn and as a course break in the financial market before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets work as they have been, and if they react to Fed’s financial extremities as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank in London’s market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The bank shared more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study research report for its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics through the cool facts and calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved before and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and the financial markets now in the same way or in another model as in previous interest rates - and what may be followed.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a much worse position to withstand the rise of interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recovery may not be a year.
Fed’s monetary policy and its officials have been determined over the last summer and early autumn, suggesting that time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first prize for more than nine years can be reached this week.
The matter will be resolved during the mid-week and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed Board will decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds steering rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular but at the same time a series of interest rates of a small 0.25 percentage point, at which Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25 % to 5.25 %, ended.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the U.S.’s most risky housing funding, and one year later the financial crisis became a global judge-day nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious financial market and real economy failures began more slowly than the previous Federal interest rates have typically happened.
Similarly, the experiments were tougher and tougher than the 1930s.
Deutschen’s strategies have focused on the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies, as well as the financial market conversions since 1950, and I will be in place from the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed’s interest rates and their financial and financial impact have been made clear since the 1950s.
Upon the start of the recovery, the fastest time has passed less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within a year or two from the start of the Fed interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has raised and shifted its steering rate to a dozen different cycles.
Each time has deviated from others in some respects, and the odds are relatively limited in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies point out that this time many things are different.
Not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be discovered in decades of research.
But three things about the victims of the crisis and the causes of its destruction may seem to be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks of the world held their steering rates too low in the 21st century.
They planted traces of the technokuplan, and at the same time grew the next.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and above all too much debt, increased by the overrun of the central banks' monetary policy.
The largest debt double was born in the economic history of the past.
3) In particular, debt financing, which packed the financial economy with the most limited arrests, increased the number of exchange coupons from shares to real estate, debt certificates and commodities in most financial market areas.
There is hardly any doubt that the financial markets raised to the highest levels in terms of ever more complex debt errors were in rare dangerous and unstable trouble when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
The financial structures that were imposed on debt instruments were not as long as their time after the interest purchases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned to an increase.
The risks were implemented as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not think what will happen next, but give a nuclear issue by mentioning, for example, the following issues:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy like ten years ago, but now debt money is cheaper literally than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been diminished, but now in different parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued as the lowest and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial market and has reduced the main securities and assets to the highest or ever before the peak of the financial crisis.
Not only are the financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the worst recession to the model that has happened before.
The euro area’s economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are relatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is next to tighten his money supply to a stronger extent.
Perhaps the French bank’s picture of the future of Societe Generale’s strategy, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it can suddenly be.
He has already trained the bank’s international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break down, and soon it's time for Fedin to turn off the financial shocks with even greater QE cash cuts.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP), which manufactures computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at the HP Business Service Party, the company says.
HP is divided into HP Inc., focused on business sales, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and consumers.
HP’s personnel amounted to a maximum in 2011 when it had 350,000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been cut to 302000.
The company will record one-off costs of $2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
The reduction of the consumer side will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to the countries of migration so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company already tells us that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its business results.
In the second year, its three most important customers brought 65% of their business results.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system after Apple Update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking on the \"General\" and then by selecting \"Administrative updating\".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had a problem after this installation, when there has been an error message on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst drop to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the end process.
This may include removing applications to get a state, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes to delete applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or close to the charger during the update that the battery does not end.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to progress, because if the battery ends up, it can lead to an update of the breach.

It is also worth ensuring that you have gone through our list of all the things you need to do before downloading so that things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with it new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and hugely new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and improve the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the management of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centrally).
According to Yle, the company’s activities are related to so-called tax planning.
It's about the Luxemburg company Saltri II LuxCo, which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself said he left a statement of disparity in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a distinction.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on a agreed schedule, Berner says in Yle’s interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a retailer who merged with the Finnish retailer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upoflor government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and in Luxembourg.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownerships go through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the membership of the government at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the government of Karel-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs’ largest owner, the capital fund Triton, was already ready for ownership by the Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens the company’s service centre
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-maintained reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening.
The number of seats can increase within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation University.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is primarily the production of healthcare and healthcare services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on the safety arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative work life tightening package
STTK will prepare an alternative package for the government’s labour tensions.
The organization also wishes to involve other employees’ organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being given to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone realizes that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the withdrawal of the organization’s administrative meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EK) is not ready for discussions instead.
The ESC's economies have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the second half of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if half of the huge enthusiasm is to have a conversation if there's a one-way relationship.
Palola: A negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centrally) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the Government is to give a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take a stand on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has always been constructive of him.
In particular, the operation of the Sundays on the STTK field is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation in which it would implement part of the tensions.
In the STKT, Palola does not suggest that the alternative package should be prepared with the SDP that has been present.
The employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life package presented by the Board last week.
As part of the package, for example, the salary of the first disease days is cut, overtime benefits are halved, Sunday compensations are reduced to 75% and the holidays are shortened.
The STKT emphasizes that the central organizations have called employees into the mood, and they have not been in a position to strike.
Akavan Fjäder
Mr Fjäder, President of the program, welcomes the STKKK's notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, STKKK is now coming to the same lines with Akakka, as the program has already outlined a longer alternative model for government proposals.
Fjader hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as the SAK package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The ambitious president, Sture Fjäder, hopes the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, to prepare the presentation as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STTK said she was preparing new proposals on Wednesday.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan announced on Wednesday that it had been preparing its own presentation for a long time to negotiate the five percent competitive advantage of the country’s government as an alternative to surgery.
The program has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akaja lines, as STKK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjader.
On Thursday, the Committee of the Regions will meet at 15 a.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Green Left of the University of Tampere
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening of Vivan bingo.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
At the request of the former Prime Minister, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in holding the famous radio call, which marked the beginning of the rebellion of Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped on television.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The Sipil’s speech has sparked criticism and ideas all day about what I’m going to like.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Association, Paavo Arhinmäki, said that “The Sipila could hold its speech in the state of the nation in the representation of the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed as well.
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, “one phone call has already been seen.
Leadership is dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Judges condemned “Monarchist Meinings: The Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “After six months of elections.
There is no single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded and held in advance for about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented in direct transmission by SAK President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyr Häkämämäminen, EC CEO.
The above is appreciated for the speech of Sipilä.
We considered the matter and found that it was part of the public service task to promote comprehensive public disclosure throughout Finland, the line in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, President of Yle publications.
It's like we at Tammel's time.
The speech has also sparked looseness.
The dinner that arrived tonight is enjoyed in good time, the children are being taken and put on their best.
My mother puts on her nicest skull and my dad agrees on her neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be on television before we're at Tammel's time, writing a blogger, Saku Timonen.
“In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also asks why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millions of people hiding in its capitals, which are making love laws for other tax collectors, and at the same time telling the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has the end of the money,” asked Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It has published a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the debt and the team?
Coupons and pens complete, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the withdrawal of al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's United Nations ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to have escaped from power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not adhere to the proposal because they believed Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Thurk wrote to him in a two-way discussion on three plans: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition between the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a slow manner.
I know Thurk.
We may not agree on all matters, but we can speak openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said he was sitting down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics don't comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the conversation, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words.
U.N. diplomats also refused to comment on the claims of Ahtisaari, but said that Al-Assad’s troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which he would have left power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is suspicious of the words of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The fact is that the Tshurk spoke with the authority of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's stick to hold power with some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow in our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no other option than to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying for the bill that we have caused, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
the Asylum Seeker Organization Centre in Toronto
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio co-operation building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Höppinen, vice-president of the City Council of Tornio, it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation to the next Monday to decide on this matter, he would specify it to the STT.
At the meeting there were 36 delegates from 43.
The organization centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On the basis of that, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers in the community at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would be working in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä is still looking for an alternative to the labour market for blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally).
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations are able to agree on this.
Sipilä told reporters that he was not in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for substitutes for the criticisms of the working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it with no other pleasure as part of the whole package.
Half of the holidays in Sipilä’s view would be a tool, as it would be directed at almost all earners, unlike the Sunday cuts planned by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree to cut the holidays because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision on Wednesday next week to the Parliament on labour disputes in the form of a Communication from the Government Council.
According to Sipilä, organizations' proposals should be known before this.
This is not the final coverr either.
The legislative work then goes on, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting harder all the time.
Now's a good time.
In such matters, it won’t take much longer, if there is a desire, the Sipilka formed.
The list published last week by the Board includes, inter alia, the conversion of the end-of-the-end and helatorstat into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the salary of the first disease days is cut, overtime benefits are halved, Sunday compensations are reduced to 75% and the holidays are shortened.
The reforms are implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these activities, the employees’ centres organise a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have declared political cracks.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the expansion of the juicery warehouse
The Council unanimously approved the extension of the stock of the management of the Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. the juice hall.
The assessment was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had originally been said.
A busy schedule is also painful.
It was also a little surprising that the order needs were not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 square meters was approved in the Investment Programme, but the funding will be decided in the context of the Interim Report.
The agenda also discussed investment of EUR 150,000 to €200 000, but at the meeting the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the local government.
The municipality has no risk as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) was founded.
In the language of Karelia, there is also a place in Joensuu.
The city government has reduced its previous steep stance to bring street names to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of the election of the cattle tradition throughout the country.
Joensu is not declared the capital city of the herd, because it has no historical grounds and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Riversuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savoy.
After a new decision, the city centre will not be listed as the street name villages.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, ready to use the language of the herd, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended for all other actors.
Although the municipality is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth having a casual attitude to the use of the language of the herd now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the special features of the county, as well as the image of Joensu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both of them can be very useful in a wide range of marketing in the county.
Train connection interruptions reduce the vitality of the county
The cuts in connection with trains hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And the effect is whether there can be a place to live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, is wondering.
He also highlights air traffic, which has been on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that we do not support the possibility of reducing the power of state, as is now taking place.
We should look at the effects of the termination of these transport links, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes the University of Eastern Finland an additional challenge in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here, such as traffic connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the director of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He notes that bad traffic connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travel a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the University towards Western Finland because the traffic connections are weak in the opposite direction.
Currently, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
More than 10-20 percent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensu has become one of my ringtones for the Battle of Siu
The view of the City Government of Joensuu on the rural Siu War project is seemingly unanimous, but there is one among the ringtones.
The City Government member Pentti Centralsalo (sd., pic) presented the entire project to the Board at a meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Government approved the decision-making proposal by the Mayor of Karelia, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though one train pair is less frequent.
There will be changes to the passenger train between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train pair is left out, but there is still five days to get from Kotkka to Kouvola and vice versa.
Supplies are due to state-saving measures.
The purchase of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years is reduced by 12.3 million euros.
The most quiet routes will be completely terminated.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out of the place.
The rescue department saved the climber from the roof to a 12-year-old who could not get his own help off the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionmäe on Ketotie at half a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-layer wooden house in the area, where there are no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not prevent the boys who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of them were living out of place and the passers alarmed the rescue facility to help the final roof safely back to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's operating profit is doubled, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressive results from the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut its annual performance forecasts, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it was going to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
In the last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock of the midweek.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end in May to be 10,40-10,90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84, reported in the FactSet survey.
In spite of the average price increases of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite the higher fees in November for land transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expects business profit to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, revenue has increased and online sales are growing.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will continue to succeed firmly, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and worldwide trade.
The plans for wages for the holiday were published a day after the competitor UPS said he intends to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the fourth quarter of August 31st, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The winning per share came from $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analysts survey conducted Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been suffering from a decrease in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in online trading has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit rose by 29%, but in principle, the revenues of the operations were the same due to the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
Express unit revenue was better due to higher basic fees, while operating profit in freight operations decreased higher labour costs.
In the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $115.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent less than the 11th of June record.
The central bank’s decision-makers are sitting this week for two days at a long-awaited meeting around the huge mahogany table, deciding whether it’s time to raise the steering rate for the first time for almost a decade.
On the other hand, the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the nation's financial interests ahead of everything else.
The Congress has set two kinds of responsibility for the central bank’s shoulders: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after a large recession, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is prepared to take advantage of a record incentive, which has led to a short-term interest rate of almost zero from the end of 2008 .
Although most of the data show the economic growth steadily, the recent collapse in the global financial markets may have already been made by the officials of the central bank in their early stages as regards the increase of instability. It is feared how the federal funds rate would be increased even in the fourth quarter of the percentage unit.
“Ignorably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be followed,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, the Meklarike Store Stifel Nicolaus & Co’s main economic experts.
“I believe, however, that if you are looking for a justification to restore interest rates, there is an increased uncertainty in the world market to wait for a valid reason,” he said.
The decision of the central bank has not been reached in agreement, which is already the result of nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloomberg’s recent study, about half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
The financial markets expect the central bank to delay the rise, as the key indicator indicates that only around 30% of growth is possible.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank increases the level if the decision-makers then fail to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose to 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep its level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, major economic experts at the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now,” he said.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, they must see a lot of effort in their guidelines to support the financial market so that they do not panic.
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial market, as it would eliminate uncertainty when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate by a quarter per cent this month, thus taking a first small step towards slow tightening the monetary position, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early spring that he expects a level to rise this year despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is lower than seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of purging.
Although inflation remains below the 2% annual target of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers believe that the temporary impact of the price of oil has been significantly reduced.
The economy is even more clear and needs to be taken into account in the strict situation of the labour market, says Ian Shepherdson, the main economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocking last week when China devalvat its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial aveage index fell by up to 16% from its May record, when investors feared China's slowing economy also slows global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the top reading.
For central bank decision-makers, the market mystery is an additional factor in the complex equation, which tells us because interest rates need to be increased.
“I have seen these events in the financial market and recent news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers expect at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impact on the US economy is still rather unclear, and they do not have much information on the consequences of the events in China,” said Oliner.
The international economic well-being is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the president of the bridge, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could ‘collective’ the increase in the amount of money, caused shocks on the market all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies have increasingly collapsed together, central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of the Global Strategy of the Property Management Company Envesnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) in Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that “the central bank has previously been over-orientated by the financial market, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes its decisions, has called for an increase in interest, and Mr Lacker, a voter of the Committee, appeals as an example to the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings, despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth, Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these cuts.
The central bank should only give priority to economic stability during the major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s interest-rate committee.
The last millerry doesn't come near its level, Posen says.
“No one wants to see a situation where the increase in interest rates is feared because the market is depressed,” said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Children's Health Organization in Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for mammals
The Brazilian Children’s Health Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with paintings of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie quantity by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that adding calories is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine, Robert Waterland, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
The Seven Canal Sunrise program is a favorite in viewers, despite the efforts of the Nine Canal to announce the results of the Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's regiment in Canberra to announce the post-representation of the Democratic Party's leadership failed to increase Today's viewers.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull passed out of the power of Tony Abbott.
The racing program Sunrise, which was run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to be detrimental to the Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average value was 397 000 in five state capitals, while Today’s number was 339 000.
The average of Today rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than on last Thursday (343 000).
Today has taken Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000 and Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
By September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers, with a total of 314 000 people on Tuesday.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
This morning, the wind blows in other countries than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was a 800-word series featuring the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a fairly impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of the newly widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series was a powerful one without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven channel The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and the TBL Familias (726,000).
Seven channels had two fates on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
Andrew O'Kefe’s first half hour of the new visual program (17-17.30) gathered 446 000 viewers in the middle.
The second half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was enough for a small win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour number was a huge number of 720 000.
Hot Seat's average was 620 000.
The Chase Australia’s second-night viewer’s decline will bring the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seattle will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Millionaire Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the viewing numbers of the McGuire program.

The final triangle agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect type, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been extremely secreted, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls don't slip who got the last rose.
However, as we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could, however, deliberately give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were thrown into poetry when they told how Wood was the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveity for the reason they wanted to be his partner.
But when they were asked, “If Wood’s last rose is not for you, for whom it should go, their response could offer a revelation of who won the heart of the male.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly referred to Mackay as the best option for Wood after them themselves.
Sarah Mackay's and Sam Wood's have been unmistakable since the first day.
“From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of Sarah and Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is very close to the country, it’s fun to be with him,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a very good couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be \"it's right.\"
“When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was worthy.
“I don’t know if I can say,” he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 19.30 a.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Haynella has many options to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the rest of the game after this Australian Rugbyliga reverser dropped the ball’s first flight kick when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday at 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayne back the next flight shot and took her into the running game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
The real character of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new entrant to the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Haynea also encouraged Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and to worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning of Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for a man's NFL-debyy.
Hayne was seen on a fascinating journey from the field after the fall, and later he told Hamish & Andy to the Australian radio pair at a 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start for his NFL career.
“It was just one of these things, you have to think about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared her evaporation with her 2007 Origin debut when the feed in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account in a photo with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the most wealthy man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun, threatening a Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was condemned, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 He died when the police shot rubbers against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in the South Nepaln police shooting rubber bombs in a crowd that showed his mind against the country's new constitution proposal, the authority said Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, an official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protestors had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resorting to rubbers.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It wasn’t immediately clear why rubberoids, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The summary was in the last few weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern continents, where members of the Ethnic Group of Madhes say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus group requires its own state.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been the central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the constitutional clause in Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National hurricane centre NHC says that in the south of Cape Verde there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane
In the wide slope, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, 60 per cent of the possibility of developing into a tropical orbital storm over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National hurricane centre said Tuesday.
On the second observational masonry, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Little Antillies, 60 percent of the potential to develop into a tropical circular storm over the next two days, was added to the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google starts the donation campaign with the aim of collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees arriving in Europe when they flee from war cracks and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making a notification to a leader, Google’s employee, Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at age seven.
“Our journey included numerous blind train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Gifts receive four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, save children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it is responsible for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refuseerelief up to $5.5 million, so that the overall goal is $111 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has been happening since the Second World War, mainly due to the four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Difficult surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of obesity type 2 diabetics may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after the surgery than those that are treated in other ways than surgery.
“To get the data for a long time, Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods for reducing the size of the abdomen are used for surgery in the defrost or bariatris.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been sickly obese and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person’s BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Thailand used the data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery, the bypass surgery of the stomach and the reduction of the stomach, the type 2 diabetes medications in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut persons fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the individuals who were treated with other means than surgery remained the same in the same way as in the 29th century.
In 36% of the people cut, diabetes was completely improved and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides as well as ‘pain-LDL cholesterol’ were generally better in the surgery group,’ the authors said.
Researchers also followed the levels of A1c in the blood of patients that reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, the haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9 % to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this better glycaemic control, which is described by improved haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between the two types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to the group in the lower abdominal surgery, the abdominal bypass surgery had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased weight index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin levels of A1c (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to reach a complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that although research does not seem to be survival or surgery after five years, there are research results in Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives.
In the Swedish study, it was found that the obesitys in the weight surgery had 29% lower probability of dying during the 15-year period when compared to a group who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The research results are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group, and are not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease,” he said.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time when the patient BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he said.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to cancel the situation.
\"Everything can't come to Europe -- Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the country of refugees.
Dalai Lama dealt with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain. The Centre is dedicated to the examination of ethics.
Dalai Lama claimed that in the current situation the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
“Everything can’t come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised German and Austrian actions in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is amazing to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how real peace and real development can be brought to these Muslims, mainly through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems, he added.
When taking the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US’s violent response caused the poor events of the chain.
“After 9/11, I presented my condolences to President Bush and told him that there was a solution to this problem through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used the power, and it created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, children’s hand-definiting agents have increased by four times
The United States has reported a strong increase of almost 400 percent in the absorption of alcohol-based hand-deinfecting agents in children under 12 years of age after 2010, according to Georgia’s Toxicity Information Centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the birth defects reported by the Director of the Georgia Toxicity Information Centre, in children under 12 years of age, rose from the 2010 3266 case to the 2014 16117 case.
“The children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are exposed to the emergency police,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some people want to influence their friends or respond to the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos in which teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap boost.
According to reports, the teens have mixed the disinfectant with alcohol content in the mouth to get a stronger drink.
The scents of a pleasant disinfecting agent can attract younger children.
“The father doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those with an added scent.
There are corn, grapes and orange fragrance disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfecting agent may contain alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in small children, only a few rubbles are needed for alcohol poisoning.
“It’s really concentrated on alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the University of Kansas Hospital’s Toxicity Information Centre, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey on the table, but the hand-definite agent is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijas Russell is a six-year-old girl who, for some time ago, swallowed only four roses of manic fragrances in the hands of a disinfecting agent at school, and was taken to the first aid.
His blood was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult rat drink, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid medical professional who held a girl outside Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Now, when you were talking to him, he couldn't walk when he came to the first aid.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
\"It was really scary,\" Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of a hand disinfecting agent containing toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders designed to poison their “bad” teachers by spreading bacteria to the classroom, according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant of the hands and banned it from its class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a “serious chat” and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths will reduce the speech about Celtic’s conflicts, and Dela will admit that Hoops is in a tight place, but she will turn it around
Hearts fights against the Scottish Football Federation in Neilson, and Warburton is guarded by the January recruits that may disrupt the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic at five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty shot took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton to Pittodri Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference in Celtic to five points.
Griffiths reduces the talk of conflicts
Celtic’s internal conflicts have been caused by rumors, but Griffiths passed them immediately. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more accurate supervision when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for an encounter.
The lack of scotch mestorus exhilarating Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfield player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, because it has no competition for a championship with Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador de Boer said: “In the Netherlands, the highlights of the Celtic Games are no longer displayed, and why...
Because Rangers are not involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and other than the Scottishs want to follow them.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss is sworn to turn around.
The destruction of Malmölle and the resulting fall from the Champions League was rapidly followed by a loss of ten men to Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference.
But Dela said: “Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again.
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is guarded from January’s players’ transfers
Although the Rangers-bomo Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on the potential points of the January transfer, he is provided with the most colourful assurance that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
Former Brentford’s boss said: “The move window in January is very different compared to the summer window.
With regard to players coming in the summer, the time for adjustment is the whole pre-time, which will appear in our team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic’s interest in Michu’s hint of retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankles and failed to find a new track outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The Red Card of the Defender was later cancelled, and this was the third red card that was condemned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson said, “I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hiberniaan player was forced to sing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in Edinburgh in Roseburn, before Edinburgh's derby at Tynecaste Stadium in March 2014.
“It was derby and it was a moment of mind,” the attacker said, “It’s safe to say that I don’t return to Tynecastle, unless I go to the Celtic.
Tannadice's government believes Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United’s government still has the ability to turn the lead team around, but admit that the decline of players must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back to work, Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy to win – Hamilton
Derek McInnes admitted that his team, Aberdeen, desperately participated in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league, which raised them to the top five points of the table, thanks to Adam Rooney’s first half-time penalty.
McInnes says: “There is no team that won anything, whether it was a pokal or too, which would not have won games in this way.
Unemployment in Scotland remains the same as the UK’s total population increased.
In Scotland, 164,000 people remained in Scotland during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the UK rose by a total of 1.82 million people.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, the national statistical centre (ONS) figures tell.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over the three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612,000.
In the fourth quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the average in the UK by 73.5%.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: “The long-term plan of governance is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I prove to be executed in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll sit on viewers in Oklahoma State Penentiary's prison watch Richard Glosssip be executed with a deadly plague.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started a bunch of this day approaching it.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Suppliers, of course, have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and because applications are often more than free places, participants will be selected through terrible valuation.
Oklahoma has reduced the sites reserved for the media to twelve.
Whoever chooses, looks at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own connection with him through phone calls over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and pen to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a journalist in Oklahoma accused me of failing my party.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner in the way he wants you to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that “you could have put your word better, but you still think what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glosssip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glosssip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, he would, in any case, make a guilty grant.
But I believe that there is a very strong possibility that he has not committed murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And this is the point of view that I see him die.
I can't say I'm totally neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
You get a picture of what it feels like to watch a man I like die unnecessaryly.
He was lured out of the Canning River after a Russian police hunt.
The Canning Vale officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's home tried to deceive the police from his cans went wrong when he found himself in a lowland, from a mud water just a meter away from a police officer who tried to choke him gently back to the beach.
The Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday due to an unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this attempted to deceive them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
\"He stood in the water, saying, \"I'm not coming out, come get me,\" said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to grow, so he used a safer tactic: “I love the police negotiations.”
“The good people do funny things when they try to escape,” said Captain Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the blow and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspires locals to start a playful Ben Cousins biathlon design.
Peter Mody claims that the reporters tried to blind him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's suppliers tried to infiltrate his assets last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses journalists and the Racing Victorian Insolvency Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the measure of treatment taken on the day of the competition was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has faced a difficult situation after an inexplicable positive cobolt sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue in tune with spy claims for a year and did not want it to look like jealousy.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and I’ve been silent about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything breaks down at once,” said Moody.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk the head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I don’t think I’m going to be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with the racing.com site, where he told me that the integrity department had tried blindly in his stables.
\"Fifteen years ago Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - I name him when I asked him, and offered him a job in my store if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They clearly think I'm a scammer.
If so, they should be able to separate their lawyers, for they have failed to capture me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodee, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are clear about it today.
Should I start to think that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to occupation and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than the trainers about what is going on in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I'm not at all concerned that the things I'm saying are not likely to make them think about it.
But now I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and it's gonna hurt me.
It really hurts me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has increased with a long-term Lidar cobolt study, and late rejection led him to find that he could traverse his license over the table.
Mody, best known for the coaching of the unwinning master Black Caviar, has called the day-to-day treatment rule for “slowering” after laying mud or clay on horses’ feet, which is irregular.
“It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to wash it in the leg.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been like it was yesterday.
It was on the day of the race.
Mody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the disease treatment of the day of the competition, from which the suppliers began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
“All of us understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver arrested in Cobram
Police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic crash on the weekend of the wheelchair in Cobram.
The biker was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley's highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and stopped to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of failing to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance, and other traffic violations.
Cycling, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy Attacks against Competitives
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has also criticised two NRL-rugbyliga masterpiece claims that his team's cabs would be part of the line.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judge allowed Storm's button on his side when he suddenly won the final race in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely hiding his reference to Storm after it won North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final track. Bennett called the game Rugbyliga's screen window, and said that two Queensland teams were not very excited.
Bellamy defended his team's fights and said they're just focusing on \"contact\".
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by two leading coach critics to Storm, because it means they are afraid to lose their team.
\"This always comes to mind - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about bending when we lost them 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or techniques all year. During the last six weeks, we've just been pressing for contact with the fights, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he probably hasn't gotten used to losing, and this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how it always comes to this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of the exciting rugby – by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing the \"girl\".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare our game on Saturday night and tell us how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have its types of players.
He brought that side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a response to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more striking than that played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not make a goal?
This is about the guidelines for me.
If they mention us, it means we can play against them at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game, either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Croronu Sharks, for the next Saturday’s pre-final in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
For a Serbian citizen, $200 for a drug charge
A man who threatens the potential life-long possession of a 40-pound cocaine carrier in Queensland has been released against a $200 guarantee.
The 29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 pounds of drugs to Solay's yacht, who came to South America through the Vanuatu, and was executed in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused boats all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs from Toyota Echo.
Although Maxovicia threatens the potential life-long business-oriented cocaine possession company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to keep the whole amount and that he could have been in the café for absolutely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Court judge, was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
“He has solid connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place he lived in.
The mother and father of Maximovic had offered a guarantee of $200 to ensure his release.
“After reading the false evidence of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of $200 is a real economic burden for them,” the judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maxovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he will give up both Australian and Serbian passports, will report daily to the police, and will be detained with his ban on outdoors between night and dawn.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used a girl's phone when asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl in bed with this phone and then logged in to the online communications service where Hogg received numerous unofficial images of children sent by another user.
She woke up later, noticed the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl studied her phone and found shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, they saw five photos, researched the computers on the site, and found “notable” web searches on searchers used to search for unconventional images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to attract pedophiles on the internet before he was a police officer to scare them.
Fiscal depute, Eidith Robertson, told Dundeen Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addition - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had performed the graves on the computer but said that they had been made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send more photos.
Hogg said he did this just for feeding purposes.
He said that after drinking, he was sick, and he wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she yelled at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw unwitting pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger.
On Ward Road, 23-year-old Hogg admitted his guilt over making or taking pictures of unwitting children on 14 June last year. He violated his bail on 25 January of this year and left the court for the trial on 24 March of this year.
Defender Gregor Sim asked that Hogga not be recorded in the sexual criminal record, as it can be claimed that his crime was not a significant sexual element.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the judgment in October to ensure that social action has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he has been arrested before processing.
He was added to the register of sexual offenders before the day of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest African leader, Mugabe, died earlier this year in the steps leading to the speaker’s high school.
He did not get hurt, but the video of the crash spread to social media like the virus.
Parliament's openings also saw the statements of the opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous killing threats that warned them to go to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they threw out and interrupted him on intertwines when he held a speech about the state of the country to the parliament - what speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said the text messages of the seven opposition politicians who received their mobile phones warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
“Numero, from which the message was sent, does not respond, but the title of the message is “death”, Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The messages warned the relevant members that immunity will end in Parliament, and when they come out, parliamentary immunity is not in force.
The group supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is “in its care” about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-reorganization efforts in business service business.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, distinguishing from the faster growing business equipment and service operations of the computer and printer business.
The expected job cuts bring around $2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter, HP's statement said.
“These restructuring measures allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, Chairman of HP, and CEO, leading the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the present-HP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help companies move into a new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our opportunity to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it focuses on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions for companies, according to the company’s information.
Jako disassembles the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduated from Stanford University in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a car garage in Palo Alto, called \"Pilaxo\".
HP has gone through a huge reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology brands in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies will perform better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says that teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and, assuming that his rehabilitation goes according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will have at least four of the following games in England, and given its background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after the single snoring, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten a career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his ankles or previous injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when the player tried to return in the middle, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
The design also has an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has only played 65 games of the Arsenal 157 league.
In view of Arsenal’s broader overall since 2007-08, for six periods of eight it has been one of the most lost days of the Valoliiga’s teams.
Wenger gives us the chance of witchcraft, but Arsenal believes that their recent improvement in injury statistics will continue.
“The ability to recover from the injury can be a period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stable, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his championship against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday, playing on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to begin.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to maintain balance and give breathtaking rest to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear continuation of the F block, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most scary in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own “Invincible” campaign in the last year.
The stadium was destroyed Tuesday night by an earthquake, which was at 3.2 Richter's scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the last season of the surrender of the Champions League against Monaco, and is motivated by an increasingly distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I was realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in series, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates for young men higher than for fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the greatest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 men’s year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 upper and upper secondary students who showed depression symptoms. According to the study, the possibility of a person recovers doubled if enough percentage of his friends were in good health.
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they were happy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this social media, in the time of communication, the style goes past the content, and the answer to the immediateness is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though in fact isolation prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, imago, social status. All this happens in the personal growth and friendship of internal values - at the expense of personal growth and friendship - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And, as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t get a bigger happiness.
The fineness of the Fredie was that it turned this focus on the main plate.
No character was defined by their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly separated from interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - these humors came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As a volunteer at the Samaritans organization explained to me: ... when listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling of...
Often, men who contact us experience that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of getting on the road is strong, as well as the feeling that if there are problems, we see it as weak.
Fredit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It emphasized the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my unbiased, external position on the other end of the phone helps people at moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And if you're taking part in Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the shooting sites are redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to the coffee in Central Perki?
Or what better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
The Freds will be sent to Comedy Central from the start to the end, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes a paint and helps PSG get past Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Mattuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria painted the Champions League in his debut, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Masters League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Master's League debut in less than four minutes, showing the French league champions the way, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally adding their front trip to Cavan in a hit on the 21st minute.
Paris, in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against Sweden’s leader, for the game was not only a sequel, but also an improvement in their fourth-finals-leading games in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, because the Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmo is his old home town team and the team in which he started his great career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the league of masters at home or at guests, so 2-0 wins create problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and there’s a good start, even though there are things we need to take on this season,” Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we were not able to make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with three changes since the team remained in a 2-player league game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine warden was named a man who would take the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why Marco Verratt's feed was caught behind Malmö's defence line and then hit the back corner of the network over Johan Wiland.
However, if someone was waiting for an easy and big victory from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a strong opponent. It won Celtic in a match to reach this level, its opening ground has nine international players and five men's defenses and two players in a deep middlefield.
But the team didn't offer much more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot on the side of the attack by 34 minutes, which went by the nipple of Kevin Trapp's painting.
On the other hand, the PSG suffered from the loss of feeds and poor finishes, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in five companies only during the first half of the period and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in touch with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective when he worked for his colleagues, and Ibrahimovic just sent a tour of Di Maria, which fell around the Wiland painting shop in 52 minutes.
In the end, the second goal was reached after an hour of the game with the sixth goal of the season, thanks to the Italian Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had moved on from the left of Maxwell's cross-flooding.
It ended with Malmö's wishes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's great fight on David Luz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the change of Ezequiel Lavez was abandoned at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. Norwegian said: “Our last Master League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The fights are not enough.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
The mine industry in Switzerland left Glencore, who suffered from the price collapse of basic goods, to collect $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for about 1.6 billion pounds to shorten its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of corrupt basic goods when the slowdown in the Chinese economy burdenes demand and causes destruction on all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore shares in London’s stock exchange’s mid-week shops.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131,60 in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed his plan to cut $30 billion in debt by about a third as part of the $2.5 billion stock trade last week.
The company sold a new share capital at 125pny shares, which meant a 2.4% discount at Tuesday’s final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, with a total value of 9.99% of the group.
Due to the long-lasting stagnation of Chinese growth, iron ore prices have decreased by about half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China’s President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House’s statement on Tuesday was confirmed.
Xin’s first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and will be the answer to President Barack Obama’s last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
The President of the United States and his wife Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for X and this spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
“Preident X’s visit gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time, it gives President Obama and President X the opportunity to talk constructively about issues with differences,” he added.
The visit, which was first published in February, is expected to be different in Seattle as well, on his way to Washington, to meet a number of U.S. tech leaders before he continues to move towards New York City and the UN September General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concern regarding Chinese alleged cyber-vaccupation and the country’s increased absolute absolute independence in the waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the difference in filming
Matt Damon and the African American filmmaker Effie Brown met in their talks about the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In the HBO Sunday-night Project Greenlight episode, the actor cut off Brown’s focus on the need for different perspectives as a result of the project’s chosen script for the Dark Chief Person.
“When we talk about differences, it is taken into account when choosing actors in the film, not the series,” Damon said.
The shocked Brown responds unbelievably to the injured, the comments, “Oho! Wow. Okay, while the comments of the Martian actor remained in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
“I want to invite people to think, any director then is how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark character is the whore that his white pair hits.
The producer of the Dear White People demanded that the film be directed to the finalists, Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon said they could give us something we don’t want.
After the conversation was sent, social media exploded into Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger with the film magazine by writing: “Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is NIN VALKISE that happens.
After his release, Twitting gathered more than 5,000 re-wittings and 4,000 calls.
Damon’s comments are at a time where the exact racial presentation in the media is in the interest of social debate.
Since the White Police killed Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement spread underground and urged the legislators and authorities to stop the discriminatory practices of the colourful people.
In February, the singer Prince introduced the winners of the Grammy Award for the album of the Year.
“From the beginning is still important,” he said.
As with books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Live Matter recently published an opinion to answer the question of the Fox News television show Elisabeth Hasselbeck as a group of enemies.
“The Black Live Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was also reported that Damon is involved in it among the entertainings, producers and mediamogules, who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear if he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior crowned
Isaac Caldier, a professional athlete and assistant composer, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received a million dollars prize.
In just the seven-year competition programmes, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the programme's barrier path.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero, and cameraman Geoff Britten, would survive the last round.
The last task was to climb about 23 meters of rope in 30 seconds.
The British first climbed and explained the challenge at the time, making him the first athlete of all time, who explained that American Ninja Warrior was exhausted 4th. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win, and was still in shock for winning a million dollars.
“It’s great to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big salary increase.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
The production director, Kent Weed, was able to talk to The Hollywood Reporter about a fictional list and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time that has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, they get the money that has the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling sorry for that.
She's just so happy that she's done what she did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If anyone had to win me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers across Minnesota Twins
The second half of the MINNEAPOLIS season has not been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last one in the American League Central division.
Tigers fully played his role on Tuesday when it won Minnesota at the 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to rise from Houston Astros to another American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was a return to a six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how they get them,” said Brad Aumus, team leader of Tigers.
Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two days, and then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) threw 6 1/3 in a pair and saved three runnings.
This was just his third quality wave in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong stop for this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to feed every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, a substitute for Tigers, was hit three times, and he was able to hit two of his first runs after the middle of August.
This was the first night of the three beats in Martinique, after he hit four against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“She was very good at the corn,” Austin said.
He looked good (in betting exercises), looked much better in betting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
Twins were three runnings in the latter half of the seventh pair, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks went home with one nest, and Simon got burned right into the second nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maueria, the only player against the only one, the pre-initiator Miguel Sana, who cut the two nests from the left-hand Drew Verhagen.
While two runners were on the field and a levelled runner on the 2nd floor, VerHagen got the third-sleep Trevor Ploffen to hit a double-player leading painting.
This was a record of the main series: 27th time this season, when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had been given the 9th start of the safety drink, Mauer cut two runs against Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player burned the word in three feeds in his fifth rescue.
At first, Detroit used Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runnings in the first two days of the right hand against a veteran player who got out of the injured list before the game, after having gone over a month due to a minor infection.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want this beginning,” Hughes said, “but when I went on to play, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I had some nice feeds done on the third pair of days.
After Hughes picked up the first base of the starter, he gave the second player Ian Kinsler to move one.
In the case of two fires, the walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side brought Victor Martinez to the draw, which took himself on the middle ground and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
Nick Castellalanos, a third-party player, continued to hit the right and cause another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned trying to move on to the third-party.
Tigers continued in the second pair and got one fire, two nests in the situation of the kidnapper James McCann and two fires, one nest in the situation of the center Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
\"It was an important shot,\" said Paul Molitor, president of Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feedholes and fed an unrunnered third pair, after which his replacement became the right-hand pursuer of A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runnings of six beats and walking with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-hand feeder Anib Sanchez had to be thrown out of his shoulder due to a stretch.
He was researched by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people since mid-August, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, the left-hand feeder Daniel Norris is coming from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers have 1-1 in four beginnings since the left-hand passer David Price was replaced by David Price on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to the real abdominal muscles.
The three series of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday at the Target Field field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
“The Chinese should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy,” he said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Support for transparency at the same time as reforms are driven forward to boost new movement and vitality, as well as to create a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a reduction of border inspection principles, a call on state-owned companies to take on private capital, and a review of the housing registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, which will name the sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest.
The system is gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change must be noted, as it plays a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market, ensuring a legal-based business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also reduce its management to the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
It also said that China will allow border areas to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up the government-led sectors to private donors, more sectors will be opened.
“The Agency does not exchange its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies funded by foreigners and provide them with better services,” the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for permanent residence permits, ‘Green Cards’, will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as older leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a statement published after the meeting.
