The Prague Stock Exchange is minus at the end of the trade
Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) are estimated to be close to half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to fall on Monday after almost six percent of the day.
This time, the fall of Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. Parliament, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Falling Stocks in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, the stock had a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indicators have finally deleted some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index has written almost four percent during the trade, but later removed some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index was 3.8%, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock market shares lost more than five percent, but eventually losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue is uncertain and affects the world’s money markets,” Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although China is part of its monetary policy, is determined independently, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should start the negotiations immediately and accept the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries will also understand the consequences of this.
The U.S. Stocks Blood Bath
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft financial system, which should have been translated into $700 billion (a crown of almost 12 trillion).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the U.S. shares had a blood bath and the leading stock indices registered the largest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones has fallen by almost seven percent, with a similar fall in 1987.
The index was already before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index was released.
The Congress has resigned: the U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks.
The U.S. Congress chief leaders and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on the agreement in a broader form and on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This will be voted in early next week.
The US legislators have reached a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the form of $700 billion (including 12 trillion crowns).
But there's no win yet.
The Congress must complete a few details of the agreement before they can publish the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system support is discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters informed the news agency Barney Frank, president of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate sources, the project is likely to be voted as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to economists, it should be reported that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the conversion of financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, it is followed by “rejoying”.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We took a great step.
We have resolved our different views on the form of a package to stabilise the market,” said the Bloomberg Agency, Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
The final vote may take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Henry Paulson on Saturday night, U.S. finance minister, to give the government fund a final form.
This should purchase non-sale mortgage from financial companies, which would put financial companies in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
“We are in favour of the final agreement on a plan that will work and which should be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair plan needs to be continued, but I think we're there,\" Paulson said.
Registration for Asian trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which fall sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is why they want to calm investors before trading in Asian money markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress’s decision on Monday trading could be the first to influence Congress’s decision.
However, it is not yet clear whether the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, as is the case at the last minute, to see if there is a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
But the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the remaining amount, which has been determined in another $100 billion and later in $350 billion, if it has a feeling that the program does not perform its function.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations
Although the President may object to this decision, Congress may overdo it.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program was the acquisition of financial instruments to buy the wrong mortgage securities losing their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to delete mortgage loans.
“We all worked out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, spokesperson for Bush, said that the president was satisfied with the Saturday's progress and appreciates the two-party efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.
Restriction of bus terminals
Christopher Dodd, President of the Banking Committee of the Senate, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also restricts the executions of so-called bus drivers involved in the programme and establishes a committee that supervises the foundation.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We worked very hard on this, and we made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have a problem with deletion.
The government should create new deletions in mortgage purchased by it, with the aim of reducing the monthly depreciation of taxpayers and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual aid
David Marek, head economist of Patria Finance, said the proposed draft is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“It is because it is not possible to know what mechanism and at what price the problematic active substances will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the financial sector and the government to share the losses between each other,” said Marek on the iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
“It is much more important that the Congress has already decided this week that the plan will be supported, and as soon as possible, they will be blessed.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment,” said Marek.
Double-floor: MP3 players vs mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
It seems clear that it is only better to buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It is probably hard to get a high-quality high-quality record player to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on the baleboards, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if the shelf is full of art rock, jazz or blues, then it is likely to dream of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some may be unacceptable for a player to give up 8 thousand crowns, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to be difficult to accept a 20 crown market earphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide range.
The life expectancy of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do a lot more than simple music play, but also for which most mobiles are not randomly.
No device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and sms, you can play music and video, pick both up, have a better-serious camera, and even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, she will have a small computer in her pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
Multi-functional mobiles also have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more you send the display to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy players.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more efficient.
That's why you're not going to play for more than a few hours.
If you even make a phone call here and there, get even a charger for your job in order to be safe - this applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problem, even worse ones can handle at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge.
The next problem is to upload music to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobiles without adapters.
The player does not need any special software with a few exceptions (iPod).
Enough of the device from your computer to download music via USB.
The majority of mobile and players are already creating a musical library that has been set up on the basis of the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user’s assessment.
Some devices only display wooden structures like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (air, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players can be handled easier, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, you should first ask about battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and of course, the comfort of treatment.
If the music primarily serves you as a background and only listens to the electricity for a short period of time, for example, any MP3 player is mobile to you.
It can actually be done by any mobile.
You don’t have to pay particular attention to what music formats the mobile or player knows.
With MP3, each of them copes and the vast majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
The MP3 is amongst the most widespread and, besides, the vast majority of devices cope with WMA-format music.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPod) occurs less.
For example, better mobiles allow online music shopping.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service, in itself, can be a strong argument for the acquisition of music mobiles.
Unfortunately, the service providers offer wheys and usually are limited to only single radios.
The prices are neither the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future, either via GSM, Internet, or wireless internet.
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own all the time.
At any time you want to listen to something, you can pick up your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is on the home hever.
It also depends on whether you always wear earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with which almost every mobile, but only a few MP3 players have it.
Many of the music phones are likely the biggest advantage of the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair walkman.
Mostly, however, you are restricted by the lack of the output of the traditional earphone.
The best and most technically equipped telephones can also cost up to 10,000 crowns with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones.
However, the advantage of the players is simple treatment.
The simplest - in no way necessarily the cheapest player (see our selection) actually copes with the treatment of everyone.
Minimum function, treatment similar to pre-standard castor or gramophony is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of a randomly activated mobile internet, and no threat to the next huge account of data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the purchase of the right card, it also has a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive people know what to do with up to 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even a cheap MP3 player you want to buy, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or Mouse.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile-walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
In the industry, Sony Ericsson reached the most common user interface for the Walkman series of mobile phones than for the separate sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players mentioned above can provide the same service in the same stock market up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (at least 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider goes to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers offer the same services as their Western European partners.
However, something is missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to reduce their price.
Maybe it won't be long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the CJU, which drew attention to the fact that the price of sms in the Czech Republic is more expensive than the rest of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission, regulation of roaming charges may be a controversial situation - Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper for some customers from abroad.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is higher than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This often agrees with Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has previously stated that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider has probably not had too many chances with its own network (although it is probably hard to find frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
A significant reduction in the price of virtual service providers to the mobile market, which would then have to respond to by classical service providers.
In the meantime, even before the market for large fish, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, sounds similar to theirs were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
We don’t have to go too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the Mobiling Virtual Service Provider in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to acquire more than 100,000 customers over a period of six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, behind Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which is owned by U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much smaller target group.
For effective operation, the traditional service provider needs much less customers.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world usually show up as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and sms, which are often offset by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper sms than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a good move can also be accepted to a target group.
This service is particularly focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobiling service provider, who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company who operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to tell if a similar idea like Poland can be discussed with us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson for Vodafone, doubted: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with the provision of services.
In the Czech Republic, it is unlikely that mobile service providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not seem to be too hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta Financial Group in a phone interview with Mobil.cz.
In general, it proved that the existing mobile service providers in Czech Republic are not too closely related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider for a while, which therefore intends to take a further step in order to become a real competitor in the company’s memory.
“We are very interested in providing our customers not only wired but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, a group spokesman.
It may be better times now.
From unofficial information, it seems that we can be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is now surrounded by a wall of intrusive listening.
“At this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would be a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special in contrast to the other markets.
Until now, we have not been invited by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area,” said Vlastimil Sršeň, a press class of Telefónica 02.
The Czech market is also linked to the specific situation of other providers.
Martina Kemrova, the spokesman for T-Mobile, exceptionally in agreement with O2, adds: “We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects that could continue to be based on.
And he added: “In the T-Mobile network at the end of the year it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear.
At this moment, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short period of time.
Vodafone’s attention is more focused on meeting its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are interested in negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most affordable for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy for partnering in this area is to build networks divided into a fast mobile network.
Responsible offices - a shell with service providers
The mobile service provider process can be easily understood, and the entry of another provider would lead to a rise in competition, a decrease in prices and a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When service providers have something important, they are able to cooperate, they are also witnessing the husavon around the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on the U.S. is likely to be affected by the birth of the U.S. company T-Mobile.
This information is publicly available on the ČTU website.
But right now, the U:fon is a good argument why we do not allow the entry of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by the introduction of the fourth mobile market.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is evident that the entry of another player into the market and services would be subject to high requirements.
However, given this attitude of mobile service providers, the complete lack of interest of Czech regulatory bodies is very surprising.
In the meantime, it is not just about the attitude of the CJU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competition Authority has the right to do so.
But the office is typically in relation to the whole problem.
\"The step to the mobile market of the virtual service provider would only be possible after the agreement between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider would be concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until now, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties is unlikely to be sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers,” Kristián Chlapua said in response to our question about the external relations class of the Economic Competition Authority.
A statement made so by representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office which should represent the interests of consumers and, in addition, ensure that no one can return to its market situation, this is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chalo is added: “In the country where virtual service providers are usually operating, we can observe that their steps to market contributed to the reduction of the price of mobile phone services.
However, there is probably no pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on the reduction of prices.
In the case of a shock, the reaction of the three mobile service providers is clearly consistent.
The question is whether it’s just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As in charging stations, the same petrol prices are only works of chance and tough competition.
“In this case, the Office did not identify any signs of anti-competitive procedure, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
No service provider has a leading position, i.e. no more responsibility for market facts.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be lacking by the telecommunications regulator,” Chalou said.
The presentation of the market leader is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CJU, based on which telecommunications is the sole market from the perspective of economic competition.
Of course, there is no Czech service provider in the leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - it is always necessary to approve the network operator to establish a virtual service provider.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logical - has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum indicator for the new OHS that three mobile operators act in a seemingly similar way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the GTS Novera company already mentioned) show that there are very similar obstacles in the course of the negotiations with all service providers.
Its responsibility is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the U.S. takes your hands off the whole case.
We've met in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecom Act, the expansion of the CJU’s powers in the field of economic competition has not been carried through in telecommunications, although many experts have been hoping to improve the situation.
This is what the U.S. representatives need to know well, but probably others are in their interests.
It works when no one is watching
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers that have already been operating in Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
These are companies selling their own mobile phone service price lists, which are only partially public.
This is about multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the service provider as a classic company client, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As a preferred customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile service providers are prohibited from making a similar advantage.
“If there were cases where we were talking about, there would be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would deal with, and which could lead to the completion of the cooperation with that company,” Martina Kemrova replied to our question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that news of this kind of activity would not have come to the responsible people of mobile service providers.
First of all, there are thousands of customers in the three companies mentioned.
In the meantime, no service provider is protected against such a procedure.
They do not have negligible profits and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not, in particular, threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: “The law allows similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their name, so it cannot be fully provided as the general customers of mobile service providers.
At least that's what the U.S. should be strange.
There is also another question for the NEWS.
If mobile service providers fail over a similar procedure, why do they prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be noted that the UOHS has relatively strong rights to expose such activity, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that there was no such evidence and that commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won’t be the most expensive
As has already been said in the text a few times, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market led to a noticeable price reduction of services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual service providers were created, classical service providers tried to prevent them from becoming more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied with the market, problems with the quality of the services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, regulators were involved in these moments, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then it was either formal measures or informal pressure that the first virtual service provider that others followed was created.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that there are no clear competences for them in these cases.
But don't give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the providers would allow a virtual mobile service provider to be set up, the UOHS will only be difficult to avoid further interested parties (discriminate).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be making more expensive calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four processings of the new version of Czech state himnus.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolá presented the new recordings of state hymn on the day of the Czech State.
The hymnust was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra with the leadership of Jiří Bělahlavs.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo, band or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The author of the change of the himnus is Otakar Jeremiš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
The Czech national song is considered one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has previously said that it has chosen young, representative speakers who are expressive and popular to sing the following variations.
“Although from the beginning, both of them, and later at the band, I tried to take care of the pure division, the good understanding of the text and the harmony,” he said.
The Czech state hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song \"Where is my country?\" was first recorded in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, complementing Frantishek Šcroup's music.
It became popular, and people were spontaneously considered their own.
The first poem of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What is “new” hymnus
The transport company in Prague will deliver the chip card for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, describes himself as a date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger enters the metros, electrics and buses, whose electronic coupon will be in his pocket instead of the paper liner.
The coupon is currently available at about one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save their chips in the information centers and orders of the Transport Company at Muzeum, Mąstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajska áhrada, Kačerov and Luka subway stations.
Coupons are also available online from yesterday via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz website.
The service has been used by more than 400 customers for the afternoon hours.
Those who start to use online trading can ultimately forget the flight schedules of metro stations, where they had to regularly go through long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers have a bar with trained servers who help interested in online shopping and carding their purchased coupons,” said Martin Opatrný, a project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will be available to opencard in the self-service automates in some halls.
How do these machines look?
They are red, the ticket managers are reminded, and the passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vlavatska subway stations.
“There are five of them in the city right now, but it should be eighty by the end of the year,” Opatrný added.
The coupon controls the driver instead of the driver
Treatment of start-ups starting tomorrow is easy.
It is enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So on trains and bus routes around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly residents of Central Czech flights travel to the capital.
“On trains classified in Prague integrated transport, fish stocks were seen with card readers to establish the zone presence of coupons,” said Dr. Filip Drakel, a popp organization that brings together the timetable for public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are built at the driver's wallet.
Therefore, at the time of entry, the driver should not only show the chip card, but also the Opencard should be placed at the location specified on the Wall.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
“If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is easiest to ask the driver for this,” Dra.
Passengers who do not communicate with buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon is valid will be able to go back to self-services saving coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is shown here on the display of the equipment.
The Saudis wanted a referendum from the United States
Sudetta Germans requested to join the United States in 1945.
This is apparent from the letter in the collection of the Scientific Library in South China.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, a few groups of Germans in Sudan turned to the president of the United States.
It also appears from a private archive that is currently preserved in the collection of the Science Library in South China.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov, in a letter, ask the President of the United States not to allow the return of the “Shumai County” to the Czech Republic, which was yet to be taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
“We correctly interpret the situation and really want to be certain in words that American troops are not in any way a suppressant and an enemy in the German territories, but as a liberaterarian,” the letter says, “Embers who bear the fate of Shumava in their hearts,” signed in words.
Since the inclusion of Czechoslovakia to the Czechoslovakia to the Germans is alleged to be a source of hope for brutality, non-responsibility, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asks the President of the United States to take over Shumava the protorate “now and forever”
“We cannot believe that without the opinion of four million residents, this area would be regarded as a foreign country for us, which suppresses and dispels the minority, and would not contribute to the victory of the allies,” the letter says.
The reason the authors could not sign is the fear of revenge.
If, therefore, the President of the U.S. is supposed to doubt the views of the Germans in Shaumai, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the county of Shaumai to see if its inhabitants wanted to become part of the U.S. and to live under the United States' patronage.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe that the expectations of the Germans are appropriate.
Even if the Czech Germans had to assume that they would be moved from the country, only few of them were recognized.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would agree to a kind of autonomy of the Sudanese.
Others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalou, a Austrian journalist born in České Budějovica.
He served as a German in Budějovice during the war in the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war the British captured him and put him in a prison camp in Holshtynsco, dozens of other Czech Germans were given a chance to teach them to be Czech.
“They trusted that when they returned home, the Czech language would come to them well,” Chalou said.
According to German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one reported that they would be relocated from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign attacking leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive action to protect roads.
It would also be possible to describe the media campaign on the emotions that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Minister of Aleš ←ebíček hopes that he will dispel the leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The campaign of 150 million will be included in television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
The leaders should be diverted from fast drive and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to stick their safety belts before they leave.
First of all, young leaders, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least, want to speak to the conscience of professional leaders.
What do you see in the ads?
The emotions, primarily human stories.
The entire campaign’s “bloody” slogan shows this:
You don't think - you pay!
The term “not thinking,” is written in letters on the license plate.
And in the blood cup, the word “pays” is mentioned.
This must indicate that a person can pay for a moment of negligence with his life.
The audiences will be on the advertising market until 2010 – scary –
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where the dramatic images of the victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising markets were produced by the Euro RCG Agency.
Pull it off, put it on the drivers.
\"The driver's system is in place.
For them, for example, when they go through the red, they save time.
The \"sleep\" is the danger of a crime or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why there's a need for information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, a psychologist.
He said the driver's attention was less effective.
“If the hazard warning board is installed, it is likely that the environment and the leaders will not deal with it quickly,” Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in return for peace
Eud Olmer, President of the provisional Israeli government, spoke of the restoration of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, namely the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan-fennsí, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published on Monday by Jedi Achron on a daily basis.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost everything, if we don’t have to give back all the (intruded) areas,” Olmer told the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we need to hand over a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the possible return includes East Jerusalem.
“The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through their feet, as one of my best friends did, should give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmer said, referring to two July cities, during which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places in the Old Town.
“The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he said.
Getting Out of Golan Fenns
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the withdrawal of Israelis from Golan-fenns, which he said is an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not recommend peace with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Siite Movement); they must provide regular support for terrorism in Iraq, which is provided by Hamas (Siite Movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Secret War),” the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after an accident: Is there a legal requirement for passengers in the buses?
The law does not know them, it is not allowed to walk in a distance bus.
With regard to the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, the question arises near the Italian Padova, whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the passenger’s activities are in conflict with the law on transport activities,” says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
The last week, a 20-year-old passenger attendant, probably caused the driver of a truck crossing the bus.
The girl’s misfortune at that moment sat next to the driver, the bus was at the least safe place, although there were two more places for him.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the passenger attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a need to see if the bus has a seat according to the traffic permit.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-range buses have no standing spaces; they are also confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jančura.
“We tried to find a solution with this miniature, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have arrived at the fact that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own meeting,” he said.
The law does not know the passenger attendant
\"There is no clear legal definition of the role of the passenger assistant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier does not have any legislation prohibiting the provision of services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle investigator; it does not define his rights and obligations,” says Hanzelka spokesperson less clearly.
Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Installation Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, considers that the law properly handles the problem.
“It depends on whether the bus traffic permit is in place.
And that's over,\" he says.
Carbuses may differ in urban areas where they are standing and limited to the maximum speed and the maximum speed between the city and the maximum speed allowed, as well as the maximum speed and maximum speed allowed, with safety belts.
As on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP’s transport safety expert, does not see a major problem in the movement of passengers on the bus.
“In the course of continuous progress, there is no threat, we may compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can beat his head.
“If the bus suddenly brake, of course, its physical laws are valid.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be resolved by the carrier by internal rules,” he says and also believes that the problem for the law has not been resolved.
Jančura is ready to terminate the services
Student Agency offers passenger services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 passengers.
The director does not consider their profession risky after the accident.
“As I have the impression that the handling of passengers is risky, I have also stopped.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers when boarding.
This would be cost savings,” he said.
In his works, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, justified the lack of passengers’ personnel with safety interests, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
“We have no passengers, we are against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it ends with some deadly injury, he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
Incredible tragedy happened
The company had been killed by a young passenger pilot in Plzeň for two years during a scheduled flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck was likely to climb out of the stop bar without using the direction indicator and stop the bus.
The bus’s driver suddenly tried to get out with a mannaver, but the right front part of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved seats were sold for the rest of the passengers is rejected by Jančura.
“These locations cannot be booked on long distance flights, blocked –
The company wants to sue the leader of the truck.
With the compensation of the daughter's family, the agency does not expect the court to judge, but also the financial compensation on the part of the victim.
Legislative amendment?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movement of passenger crews on the bus can be made by law change, which has been working for more than a year as a 30-person group of experts at the Ministry of Transport.
“But the group did not have any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with maximum speed and mobile use during driving,” says Hořín expert.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers’ assistants to be something that would essentially threaten the safety of passengers,” says Hanzelka spokesperson, stating that the safety of the car buses is subject to the authority of the police and labour departments.
Dusseldorf Hopes pass in Frankfurt
The letter to the bank staff of the WestLB’s board of directors is not limited in the big words.
From the merger of the Düsseldorf financial institutions and the Frankkfurt Deca-Bank, the central capital market organisation of the savings fund group could be established, writes a letter published on Monday.
The WestLB would take you into such a business for a long-term profitable “competence block.”
Such a relationship could give rise to further interconnections in the final hit-up range banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertainty of WestLB's bank continues to be under huge pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Service Administration, which recently announced with the North Rhine-Westphalia province that limits the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, for savings money customers, between Deca-Bank and WestLB, a kind of connection has been a long way from the frankfurti section.
Franz Waas, Head of the Deca-Bank, announced at the end of August, that the bank in Mainzer Landstrasse and a province bank, such as Helaba or WestLB fusion, could not understand.
However, the Board of Directors of Deca, one half of which is represented by the regional banks and the other half of the members of the savings finance alliances, has entrusted the Management Board to conduct negotiations with the WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved.
However, the negotiations - claim financial circles - have just begun.
With 3,000 colleagues, the name of Deca-Bank, one of the major employers of the Frankfur financial sector, is not first reflected in the consolidation of the savings finance sector.
In 2003, Deca-Bank appeared to be united with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing of this three alliance.
The plans were barely published, the government of the province spoke against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks couldn't find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
But again and again, the idea of the relationship between the Deca-Bank and the province banks has been raised.
Last, however, Günther Merl, the Head of Administration of Helab, spoke against the plans of mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is worth recognizing that there is a need for the different banks of the various sectors.
Now, after the election of the Bavarian province, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on additional fusions increases, potential partners may lose weight slowly.
In South Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, where the financial crisis has been significantly better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The fusion with the WestLB was excluded by Gioverband Hessen-Thüringen with 85% business in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
No better off with NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are just one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank are suited.
Merl said in June that the German Treasury and the Jewish Federation had not yet given an answer to the decisive question of what business model should be provided for the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is possible to cut the WestLB, which they do not want to understand.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there also indicates that they are always seeking a “full solution”.
How this can be agreed with the merger of each unit with Deca-Ban, it is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend of Italy.
This is the first time for Luca, the third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the five-liter barrel of Kaiser branded, there is a strong body-shaped professional man, and it proves that about 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest are able to attract deep sounds from the throat.
Elena first surprises Luca's face, then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses from the car car park near Puorta Nuova train station start at 23.45 am – distinazione Monaco, paint della à – for the trip, arrival is expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are held mainly for Italians, and only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans had already played a song next to their flag, and the celebration started during the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians,\" says Marco Guarda.
Buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, artistic coat and a wide, silver-dry eyeglasses.
He traveled to Oktoberfest for five years, and he only organized three routes this year.
At night, during the day of Oktoberfesten, home at 22.30.
The hotel would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, which includes a welcoming Kaiser beer, accident insurance and a German-language foreign course in Marco Frankfurt, which was cooked in accordance with the Bavarian beer cleaning law.
And now the buses are in the middle of the night towards \"Brennero\" on the highway.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will soon be quiet, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses take a short break in front of Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week according to the plan, there are almost 50 other buses that came from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco has one last piece of information, he describes the plan of war.
First of all, pick up the yellow hat.
On the left side of this section, the letter “Oktoberfest” can be read, alongside Marco’s travel agency’s internet address: “Conoscersiviaggiando.it
Second, “When the brewing gate opens, running,” Marco shouts in the morning.
\"Futás- Run and take places in the back of the tent.
“We are not ahead, for we are stuck, and not all yellow hats shall sit on the same pads, but spread out in the tent.”
The one-litre basket costs €8.25, and it screams Marco.
And don't forget the tips.
\"Show the security guards that they behaved well.
As you leave your seats, they take care of them.
Third, “Today you will be here at 9:30 a.m. – Did you understand?
And now we're heading to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men, as a road indicator, binds yellow hats to trees, boards, and even one of the great Bavarian national party election posters.
We need to prepare for the withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as the weekend of Italy.
There are no exact figures; there are 50 thousand people who cross the Alps in the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors in the weekend come from Italy.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers are helping the Bavarian Red Cross, with about 200 medical care in their national statistics, the Italians occupy the first place to prevent Austrians (about 80) and the lowest-level British (about 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu brewer was particularly popular.
Dreamless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed last week.
It is even lucky that the politician used the word “very,” and in his words, he added that the German banking sector would not be saved by the crisis-like developments.
Because this happened this weekend.
The Hypo Real Estate (HRE) company in Daxon has received a billion loan from the German banking consortium to protect itself against market tourism.
A person who knows the situation on Monday told Reuters that credit subsidies would kick to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only after the part used.
Money comes partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, the losses of Depfa’s subsidiary are.
According to a newspaper newspaper, Depfa, a state-funded Depfa borrowed money for long-term projects, and it was extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of market infidelity.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2,37 million, and the share of its own capital decreased from 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current revenue and net revenue from the money trades fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, from credits to claims and certain securities, and from the liquidation of the credit transaction, with a reduction of more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to the reimbursement of higher revenues resulting from the subsequent conversion costs of the former Depfa group, and the reimbursement of interest under the Regulation and the business of companies belonging to the consortium, the income deficit of 16% was relatively reduced.
Following the privatisation in 1990, the former state financier first speculated with corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently separated from Aeral Bank.
With the help of classical state funding, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects as well as in the joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP), and has expanded its operations internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate is now required to carry out a description of the value of the subsidiaries, which have a “important effect” to show the results of the group, in a fairly general way.
The fact that there was no dividend payment.
The dividend has been reduced to the third in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinance, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, bank lending is overthrown as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance one part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about EUR 50 billion a year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group’s funding needs are covered by the loan and the company is protected from the influence of the currently largely inefficient international financial markets.
According to other sources, funding is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of HRE, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use money markets for an foreseeable period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Administration (BaFin) see that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This gives the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and incalculableness of the crisis, there can be no evidence.
It is not surprising that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite of this cannot be excluded.
After Saturday’s late evening news, the bank was still on the edge of the bankruptcy, and the temporary rescue of the equal could not reassure the Tuesdays.
The stock price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond exchange is quite good.
While debt in the first place is scarcely changing, the exchange rates of re-ordered bonds have declined significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects earlier subsidiaries, Württemberg Hypo bonds and, as a result, runs beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously appeared to be an alternative to speculative investment, their value stability now needs to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, and the fact that the financial institution brought the crisis almost to house by taking Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it may be due to the cancellation of the benefits to the deadline.
Or it will happen, in which almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will be able to overcome in the next 15 months.
However, according to the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of certainty has now been merely a legitimate remene.
For long-term lenders, the decision to divorce their investments may cause unhappiness nights.
Short-term investors may nevertheless use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes to be paid after the future years’ exchange rates.
Secrets of Sylvana and the Intrusive Box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltro has to be introduced to Tachibana Highschool on the first day of teaching, the girls begin to be snooped: The German girl is full of \"casí\"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangoes - in the new exchange blog about Japan.
“The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was really excited.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the side of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and travel 40 minutes by train from Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road alone, luckily, I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as home in Also-Saland.
Students start to chat from eight hours until 8 o’clock in a short conversation with the teacher begins, the “home room”
But before the teaching began, I had the line to introduce myself.
I am not the type who is happy to speak to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old skirt for my housewife, she's got a shirt, a blue knee and a black leather shoes.
So I was standing in front of the cathedral in this dress, and I tried to say the right thing: “Sajonara, vo nor Sylvana . . . . . . . I came from Germany and will be my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I started studying the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, snoreing and whispering, and I have always heard the word “swimming.”
I already knew this from my manga.
This belongs to the basic language of Japanese girls, and it means “cute, sweet,”
And then I went to my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled, felt honored to be planted next to the exchangers.
The rest of the clock was quiet enough, but when the bell was ringing, they ran off regularly.
Everyone talked back and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my belly - and it's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break, everyone packed their insides.
My visitor made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the ten-hour sandwich in the boring German.
I got spiced rice, little sausages, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofuba glaze meat.
Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
Foods look strange and have a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Yeah, maybe except for the salty broth, Brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the inside is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own hand-made inside, which is specially made by an artist - in the hope that you can get closer to the boy at lunch break.
I read this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can see this here.
“Because of Japan,” asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
\"Because you're simply enchanting...
After all, I’ve been reading the most popular mangoes for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture they described, I started learning Japanese sometime.
It was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I am attracted to tradition and habits.
And they're in big trouble here.
Japan is, on the one hand, the country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
The rats also have emotions.
A rat or a mole is in danger, does that mean he feels scared?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can you determine whether you feel the same way when you behave like us?
For years, scientists have published their articles in “Edge” online journals.
SPIEGEL ONLINE, in one series, “What it takes to be real, without proving it,” relates to the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other consciousnesss, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot prove that other people have knowledge.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brain is the same.
However, as we explore other species, and in general the questions of consciousness are broken down, we come to a difficult field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is put at risk, it does the same thing as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, escape or attack.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experiences by some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to take our own subjective experiences to the animal.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the side-by-side prefrontal brain cortex (for the role of short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This broad area is more advanced for man than for other mammals, and it seems to be completely lacking in other living things.
At least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain, such as the consciousness of who we are, or, in the case of design and decision-making, it can reasonably be assumed that man is different from the other main mammals.
An additional dramatic characteristic lies in man’s linguistic nature: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often claimed that this depends on consciousness.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if it is not dependent on the language, the language would definitely influence, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to differ greatly from most of our consciousness pages.
It is therefore difficult to determine how knowledge can be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then research will put us in serious trouble.
Most of my developments relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be more easily accessible to science.
The conscious processes of the animals could be examined without regard to the tarmac, and this is precisely what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of the main mammals, in particular in the example of visualization.
However, in this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely on the ideological relationships of consciousness rather than on the distant mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of a prefrontal brain cortex in the formation of visualization.
What does this mean about emotions?
This leads me to activate an emotional system, such as fear, in the brain that is conscious of its own activity.
What we call fear is, therefore, the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the protective system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) in the brain involves working memory.
Thus, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the cortex, which are characteristic of the main mammals and in particular to man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, the perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and linguistics, we can distinguish and categorize states to describe them to others in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the areas of the brain cortex and brain cancer, as well as the Jaak Bankseep, who is more focused on the brain.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed very easily, it can play a role in the broad emotions of species.
I can't tell you that, but I think it's unconvinced.
Banks believe that what seems to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can rats and humans feel the same way when they behave like this?
A cockroache escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience yet.
Although the neurolization continues to help: rats and humans have a similar brain strain, the cockroaches have no brain.
But the brain cancer is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans: how can we prove it to the rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even the cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are basically different from ours (with which human consciousness is based on special circuits and languages), I’d rather explore the emotional behavior of rats than my emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is slowed at the neural level, if we measure the same level in rats and humans.
As for rats, I do not look for language and consciousness, nor do I know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I'd rather move forward than to constantly bump into a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Time of Grace to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik said that preparations will shortly be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees trust in Ukraine in the UEFA Bordeaux decision and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship with Poland,” said Vaszjunik.
“This does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is a lot more to do in both countries.
In terms of the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are absent.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
“We need to work with a mass accident now,” said Grigorij Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
“The UEFA will keep us under constant control.”
In Poland, they were even more radical.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Alliance, which was replaced by the independent supervisor of Robert Zawlock.
The Commission agreed on the initiative of the Minister of Sport of Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“The threat of the Kommoly is that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP News Agency.
“In the beginning, we provided Michel Platinum, the UEFA president, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the 2012 EB.
Only in the past season had several first league teams to be classified into the lower class due to manipulation, and finally the league star had to be postponed.
The Uprising Dennis Quaid
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she spoke about her private life in the interview, and now she's had a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan, a Hollywood-star husband, Dennis Quaidet.
The one who lays - and cuts back
The late war of roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex married: The two Hollywood actors, seven years after their divorce, are fighting a terrible battle with each other - in front of the public.
In an interview with the American InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan said the reasons for the divorce last week: “Dennis was long unfaithful to me, which caused a lot of pain.
And after the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis was cheating on.
The spiritual stripes took place because of Ryan’s new press work on “Women” film, which tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the cry of a loyal husband: “It is terrible,” said the 54-year-old actor, “New York Daily News,” saying, “that Meg unhappiness repeats the history of our relationship.”
In addition, “it’s a pity that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are re-introduced with many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child.”
While Ryan lives alone since his divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, the answer concludes with the following page: “My life continues anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is best.
Flight ticket prices and hotel room prices
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were less than 50% cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms are again more favourable - so you can sum up the results of a study by an American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its first half-year booking data in 2008 and, after the first quarter price increase, established a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After the price increases in the hotel market for many years, hotels have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9% in 41 cities in Europe compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3,6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37% less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the low price of the dollar, which led to “the relaxing travel of American tourists.”
The reduction in hotel room prices affects financial centers such as Frankfurt or London, as industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The rise in hotel prices in Norway is a European record.
There was also a growing change in the prices of flight tickets in the first quarter.
Due to the decline of kerosene, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-term flights with high fuel cost fell by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class flights decreased by 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but prices in business and first class only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, with a decrease of 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
The reason for the decrease in prices lies on the one hand in moderate economic growth - the company claims.
There were a number of segments in the airport market.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement that liberalise air travel between the US and Europe, the competitive pressure will be increased.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that the airlines will cancel their lost flights and several airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV 1:0 is bleeding to Gladbacho
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV has been put to the edge of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still not able to find the team.
Kristoffer Klein expansion Deep flight for the national selected Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game, and the raise came back from the gate.
His message was convincingly abandoned by his lips.
He just knew he was right.
\"We need the second goller,\" Hermann Rieger said, in a corridor leading to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat in their place again.
Rieger has been a physical therapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, and has been a greater authority than some of the players in the lobby.
Therefore, his request found a hearing in the competent place.
Cornelius Jol was a assistant, and he showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the manager of Hamburg, Martin Jol's brother.
His command could be the same: Here with the second goal.
The execution of the order is missing.
“Today, it was not always a beautiful sight,” Marcell Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhardt was more “imaginative of it.”
The 1:0 (1: 0) golos result is due to Mladen Petric’s head, and the fact that the very weak Gladbachers were not able to cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
“It was a great victory,” Martin Jol said.
Hamburger SV is now 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table above the show, which showed their team as the top of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
“We know where to do this,” said Marcel Jansen.
It does not suggest that the certificate between the tableella is more of an incalculation of the flag than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team finds its late-awaited collections – thanks to the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the gate of Petr and Jansen acquired by FC Bayern – but he doesn't even have a grill yet.
“We need more sense and action,” Jol said.
After the landing
Wall Street is fear.
The first news about the failure of the rescue kit resulted in a temporary drop in Dow Jones at 700 points.
This was the biggest loss in his history in one day.
Later, Dow was strengthened.
At 20:30, the world’s most important stock exchange barometer was good 5% and stood at 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, a supplier of technology papers, fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minusus.
The largest loser in Dow at this time was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America by 12 percent.
No paper was reinforced.
Goldman Sachs’ shares fell nearly 10%.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought a stake in the bank.
In the framework of the rescue, funds are planned to be provided for the purchase of so-called double mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive stock options from financial institutions, which could be selected in the event of a proper development of exchange rates, reducing the burden on the state bank.
The European and American and Share Exchanges
Billions of aid to European and US banks do not break the doubts of investors.
Hypo Real Estate is a German bank stock exchange and takes Dax with you.
The American Dow Jones show is declining despite the planned saving of the money market state.
The spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank were deeply reduced to the German share index (Dax).
In spite of the rescue operations of the federal government and private banks in Munich, the value of the real estate revolving stock fell to the quarter, the Commerzbank fell by more than 20%.
Dax fell under a breathtakingly important 6000 precise limit and recorded 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets have been forced to the ground around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened a major loss.
Investors are afraid that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to bring money markets to momentum.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3% to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. Parliament wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote will take place on 1 October.
The rest of the European stock exchange is also known for just one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2% decline, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743,61 after the initial increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell to 18.286,90 points by 2.1 percent.
The Indian Sensex index was set at 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares deteriorated after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank recorded 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also said that Thomas Cook’s shares were not sold.
Dark material affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing inconsistency among the researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses- spacecraft flew in space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the long-painted fuel pipelines, the ice death is at risk.
Among scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon, swing-by anomalia, has been causing confusion.
Swing-by is the gravitational price of the space probes, which will provide an additional momentum in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, as well as Ulysses, used this physical trick.
But what the researchers have been amazed for years: Flying objects are not fully behaved as they would be expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, there are disorders at the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
The physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was crucified to a swing-by anomalia.
Some experts fear that the general relativity of Albert Einstein may not be fully correct, which will capture the mass extraction of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and that swing-by anomalia is trying to explain the so-called dark matter that astronauts discovered in the universe.
“For the anonymity, dark matter can be responsible, which may be found near Earth,” Adler said.
The existence of dark matter was only known by space researchers for ten years.
It clearly produces a gravitational force that can be observed for the effects of other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is invisible, i.e. non-magnetic radiation, especially visible light does not release or beat back.
Scientists estimate that the entire mass of the universe consists of a good one-fifth of dark matter.
Exploited tourists in Egypt
After spending ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists who were in Egypt are once again free, confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of Euros.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages died.
In southern Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
The exchange fee negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists are free in Sahara.
This was reported in the Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab television and Italian media.
According to the Italian television broadcasts of Sky TG 24, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: “Our fellows and other hostages have been released.
We are currently studying their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe, reported on Egyptian public television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are reported to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting of hostages before the release of hostages continues to be vague: According to an Egyptian security officer, hostages have shown their willingness to release hostages when the Sudanese army suddenly killed their hats.
“The problem has been solved.
The ransom was accepted,” the official said.
“As long as the hostages were taken, the trial was about to take place, when suddenly “the surprise” happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one hostage.
\"Al-Massri al-Jom\", referring to a German broker, reported that the release of hostages is carried out freely because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, hostages are released after payment of the ransom.
The men are kept by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
“He has led to murder – the violence of Ammopapa
He said in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been raped for years.
He spent six years in prison in the Cornwall County Stithians, 57-year-old Michael Trerise, after making a confession about the attempt of eight-year-old rape.
The Truro Criminal Court found that he regularly bound his stepmom, Stephanie Randle, between his five- and seven-year-old age.
In a statement by Trerise, he wrote: “I feel strong about my death.
He said that Randle was killed at 34 years old, in his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth on April 1, 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and tied his eyes in front of the communion while his mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise left his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall again.
He moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Organisation, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously loved to surf and ride, said his friends, “an emotional dead, and said of life.”
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his plymouth apartment.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle came into contact with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his testimony in a letter, saying, \"I've always tied up and tied his eyes in.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re a very strange fetishist, and it’s probably terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
It is even more thoughtful, however, that if you did not do so, the case might have never been brought before the court.
The judge added: “I call on Stephanie’s parents to see how their crime you have committed over the years had an impact on their daughter.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.
An important data losing official has been accused of
According to BBC's announcements, government officials are charged with violating the secret documents on a train in June.
He was sent to the Ministry of Defense when he left two strictly secret documents on a train in Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest accusation of violating the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional crime.
According to Frank Gardar, the BBC State Department's reporting officer, the move surprised many people in Whitehall.
“They believed the case would be treated as an internal case by the Ministry of Defence and the Government,” he said.
An employee who cannot be called was charged under Section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The State Prosecutor's Office has suggested that the accused of an official is represented by the Metropolitan Police on the basis of his rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday, and then moved to an unknown place from his home.
Housebuilding cooperatives pay their B&amp;B account
UK housing cooperatives can charge over 80 million English pounds after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds to protect its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors’ money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, the President of the Association of the Housing Boards (BSA) said that companies and members should pay.
The payment of 14 billion important loans will eventually take place after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley’s mortgage.
However, in the meantime, the accumulated interest is charged annually to 700 financial companies that use loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that it is one of the 59 housing-building cooperatives.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been careful to do so now have to pay the accounts of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that each company must pay a proportion of the deposit amount it owns. The companies share between them 18% of the costs.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to put aside 81 million pounds to pay the first-year interest rate.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that the measure was unfair.
“It’s embarrassing that institutions have to pay the accounts of much less cautious institutions that were careful at the time of the recovery of the housing market,” he said.
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we need to examine this matter in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from a significant account,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 will cover 7 months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full annual interest rate, which may be twice the current rate.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organizations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the account, either through higher fees or lower interest rates after their deposits.
The price of milk per litre increases by five barrels.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that from Monday it will increase the wholesale price of milk by five more pences per litre.
This year, this second price increase has been since the two pence rises in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Distributors themselves decide whether to pass the price increase on to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey changed for the last time in 2002.
He rejected the request of the former Parliamentary Member of Bangladesh to defend himself in a free place
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request for the protection of former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina in the patents, which means they could be arrested when returning to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him in the free trade with regard to the accusation that 50 million fines had been blackmailed from a businessman at the time of his representative ($729,700).
This case is just one of the many charges of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina was released this month against the old political opponent Khaleda Zia.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but the party, Awami League, insists that the temporary government of the country supported by the army will give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although conditionally released for treatment abroad, it is not clear from the conditions of free footing that you can preserve your freedom when you return to the country.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
“The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s claim for bail that it was not necessary, as it was temporarily placed on a free foot and involved in treatment abroad,” we found out from attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
\"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court.
According to his lawyer's argument, he needs to be protected in the free warehouse so he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League Party on Sunday said that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested to take over the temporary government supported by the army, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan Anti-Policy Programme
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan remained out of the recently organised polio vaccination program due to the violence on the Taliban.
Last week, the U.N. vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandhar south.
According to a UN spokesman, all this happened despite the Taliban promise: they will not attack or prevent the work of thousands of personnel who have been vaccinated.
Rejected BSkyB appeal on ITV
BskyB's appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which ordered it to reduce its interest in the rival television broadcaster, ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share from 17.9% to 7.5% in ITV.
In the past, the Committee found that BSkyB’s share prevented competition and would have an unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL from purchasing Virgin Media since then.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV threatens the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom were all opposed to buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV’s share would be meaningless and disproportionate, in particular given that BSkyB said he would be willing to give up his voting rights.
A further investigation of the case of U.S. prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the defeat of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The step was followed by the criticism of the decisions of government officials by the Court’s chief supervisor on the matter.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Supreme Public Prosecutor Alberto Gonzalest.
The investigation was ordered because it was afraid that state prosecutors were lost from political considerations.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor, will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation tried to stop justice by lying.
“The serious charges for a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified,” Chief Inspector Glenn Fine said.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to confess witnesses.
The series started by removing nine state prosecutors from the U.S. judicial warehouse in December 2006.
At the time, state prosecutors were said to have been released because of their poor performance.
However, later it turned out that the lost state prosecutors had nothing to do with it than many other colleagues, so many have come to the conclusion that political consideration was drawn behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating the government's orders and dealing with court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their position.
The head of the court store, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks of the Supreme Public Prosecutor for the loss and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials in the court store also gave up their resignation.
In his report of the Chief Inspector, Gonzales greatly criticized the role of the case. He said that the Supreme Public Prosecutor is “main responsibility” for the dismissals, “reported” for his leadership role, and “preparedly withdrawn” from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant of older Bush, will be judged by the fact that no cooperation has been demonstrated during the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa
The Rockstar Meat Loaf will be recognized at Q Awards for the epic himnus “Bat Out of Hell”.
The singer who will receive a special gold medal next week at the London celebrations said he considered recognition honorable.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second-length song, Meat Loaf, was a song titled by the album Meat Loaf in 1977, an ordinary garden.
Coldplay has received most of the nominations for this year's awards in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: “There are a few songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and “Bat Out of Hell” like this.
The song that Jim Steinman made was very loud, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song started with almost two minutes of instrument.
It was released in 1979 as a single disc, and it reached the 15th place on the Slagerlists.
However, the album Meat Loaf-Bat Out of Hell had been present for almost nine years on the scalger lists and then sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003 he had surgery after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to heveny gynaecitis.
Later it turned out to be a cyst on the tone.
An unknown big city street that they often forget about and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of rays, tours, and other sideways. Some of them are famous, others only perform practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents could find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from the First Street - without reaching the second street - between Bowery and the second ray.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main route.
There are no street signs.
Virtually, you can’t find it on a standard map.
But the street has wonders.
There, for example, Avalon Bay, is the building of the recently built first street luxury buildings.
He wants to break the Extra Place again, and he wants to make sure that new buildings can get to the shops and boutiques of new buildings on a cleaner path.
The wonders of the street include the long-time neighbors who were caught in the sand street that it was the only remains of the past before the renovations in the area.
However, the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city, has no intention of insisting on it.
This month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay of the municipal district management committee submitted a proposal that the architect would buy the street.
However, the Committee would like the street to stay in the city's care and asked for a new plan for the next month, Susan Stetzer, head of the municipal body number 3.
“There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to stay in the city,” he said.
\"You can come to the room for proposals for renewal and management that Avalon may carry out, but we also want to guarantee that you will be available to the public.\"
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to break the street again, and he would like to see seats. Some of them would use a café, which the builder would expect to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first released at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, they don't insist on his possession.
“The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renew this restless alley and turn it into a pleasant public watch,” he said, adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of buildings and not the management.
Compared to Bowery, Extra Place has no historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, Philip Minthorne’s great estate was divided between his countless children, and no one held a claim for the narrow Earthband.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back door of CBGB opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most ridiculous of the photo on the cover of the album Ramones-Rocket to Russia.
“Remek was a location,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
“He had garbage, clothes, barrels and posters, and wooden leaves and ropes,”
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned East Village, opposes the sale of Extra Place. They argue that it has to remain in the possession of this piece of public property, whatever kind of modesty, of the community.
Others mention Extra Place as a rare one, which is a practically unchanged piece of the city and which must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the “Jeremiah’s Lost New York” book, published in 1952, a copy of the book “The New Yorker,” published in the book “The New Yorker,” which was published in the book “The New Yorker,” entitled “Warish Speech.”
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, which is bordered by rusty, iron-made storage doors and flattened windows, and where the wind carries one week’s newspapers in the canals.
The street, apart from a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which led to the CBGB, and now belongs to a high-priced clothing store.
On the walls was graffiti, and an empty, 0.75 liters of beer bottle lay next to a threw, fresh newspaper paper.
Some contributors said they rarely remember Extra Place, but they think it would be possible to renovate.
Fields said that some people believe they underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, dull and disgusting places,” he said.
Debate on Bilateral Education: Continuous Exposure to the English Language Environment
In this part of the Education Observatory Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi are discussing the opinion of candidates on two-language education.
Lance T. Izumi, who, at the Pacific Institute of Public Policy Research, is an experienced researcher in California and director of education research, is “It’s not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school opportunity” co-author.
It is not easy to be in favour of voters from the Spanish language areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals for education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Afro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to acquire a degree than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan specifically supports students in English, among other things, “transmit two-language education.”
However, the question for Obama is that its commitment to dual-language education, which focuses on school education in non-English, is overlapping its interest in overcoming high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contractary Primary School in the East of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish and low incomes.
More than one third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 State Mathematical exam.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of fourth graders have performed excellent English language and literature exams.
This incredible performance is not valued by the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repeating, exercising, evaluating skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle for students studying English is “completely immersed” in the language environment.
The essence of the method of exhaustion is the almost exclusive use of the English language in the teaching of other objects.
Mikels, who opposes the two-language education, said: “We had a great success in walking into a classroom without seeing who was the student who came from Mexico 12 months before.”
\"It works,\" he said, \"We work.\"
Would Obama set schools like Sixth Street Prep as an example of other Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to make the answer, but because of the educational policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported two-lingual education), and since they are also consistent with the dual-language education themselves, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently said he had an underestimating question when he said that people should not be so worried about the “inquisitively English mivoltat” of the law.
Instead, he said, “They should be able to speak Spanish to their children.”
If Obama really wants to achieve a decrease in the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them into nothing.
Due to the renewed concerns about the economy, the price of oil fell steeply
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply due to concerns that the rescue plan for American financial markets will not be able to raise the economy.
The crude oil securities fell by seven percent back to $99.80 at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have decreased by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchange was inspired by the Wall Street financial confusion and a few powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price of $154.29 per barrel in July, they returned almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before they were again subject to the enormous uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were reinstated by concern even after Congress’s leaders announced that they were able to agree on the economic rescue operation that is the greatest in history.
The news had a shadow that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time.
The recent events of the emerging crisis, the Citigroup, will purchase the Wachavia Corporation’s banking business, announced on Monday by the government.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of desperate weekend negotiations, it seems that the rescue operation failed to increase the interest in stock trading.
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for commodities, such as oil, will also decrease.
“The future of the stock shares, interest rates and currency exchange markets has become uncertain around the world,” Deutsche Bank wrote.
\"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the \" epidemic\"
The biggest question about the stock exchange is the extent to which the U.S. disease affects the whole world, especially China.
As the decline in economic growth led to a decrease in oil consumption, the analysis of the banks has narrowed their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20%.
With the second quarter bra, the team set up its record
After spending more than eight seasons in Jets than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in Defensive himself, believed he had seen everything.
But then he looked at the second quarter of the expansion on Sunday, when Jets turned a slot-free game into a sensational match.
“I haven’t seen that before,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals were fully aligned with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, Quarterback 12-yard touchdown, gave Laveranues Coles a perfect advance for an afternoon during which their cooperation was significantly improved.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of half-time.
“I didn’t regret the effort,” Favre told all of Coles’ passports.
“Pokoli is a good player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' leader Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis, who plays in the Cornerback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards that got touchdown.
Eric Smith, a security player, got into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last turn could have been the most amazing mozzana in the game.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely 20-yardsfield got shot, setting the 34:0 and the result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter of the year.
When they asked the Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to characterize the game's delusional character, saying, \"The second or third quarter.\"
When he was told that in the third quarter, Cardinals acquired 21 points that the Jets did not get any - Mangini said: “I must say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third one.
We got a lot of points in a short time.
Gebrselassie will overthrow her world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people consider it the best mid- and long-distance runner ever to be living in Berlin, when on Sunday, he was the first to run the 42.2 miles in 2 hours.
At a conveniently smooth track, Gebrselassie improved the previous result of 2:04:26 in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie’s 26th world record was set in such a variety of areas that he won a world championship from 1500 meters to Marathon, or a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, afraid - which, looking back, may have proved to be too cautious - to further exacerbate his astmatic problems.
Instead, he was appointed to the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions, at the beginning of the day, at 9°C, and at 13°C, Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds per mile.
Ever since the marathon was previously launched, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga in Kenya turned towards longer distances, the marathon record decreased for more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won the result in Berlin in 1998 2:06:05.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, she was stuck in her legs, and she couldn't train for two weeks.
It is obvious that it was refreshed during the forced-restriction, and it was not rusty.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
A week ago, I started training again, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine.”
He has received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, from the eastern African rival, that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, leaving him as if he runs on a track and puts world records in front of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie’s greatness in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the point at 1:02:04.
Two cutting-edge Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie, after the jets got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 miles ahead of the target, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, second goal with 2:05:36, five minutes to improve his individual’s best.
Kamath was third in 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, ended a remarkable year with the seventh fastest win of 2:19:19.
The World Summit is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with 2:15:25.
In the past spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with the result of 2:24:14.
Because of the alleged back injury of the Beijing Olympics, he was quickly cured and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved for five minutes at the individual peak. This was the third marathon district run he attended.
He won the competition with a smart calculation: he first allowed a group of four people in Ethiopia and Kenya to advance and take a significant lead, and then came after about 30 km.
The Etiop Assale Tafa Magarsa was the second goal with 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became the third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and attempts of the blacks
In the Greater Orlingo experience park - a few miles away from everything that shines, sounds and huge - they hide a quiet small town where the pride and complications of African American life were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city integrated into the country, and which was the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was written in 1935: “The five lakes, three crocodiles, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmer, a lot of guajavas and two schools, without prison,”
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora festival. The Eatonville celebrations are held in honor of Harlem's most famous female writer, Hurston.
However, in many respects, the city that it has described and made tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guide book issued by the Federal Writers of the Crusades of the Church, is separate from the environment.
The same independent, dignified and closed in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the Florida City Blacks often refused to share their real thoughts with white people who “know little about us that they don’t know what they’re going to miss.”
Even in the year when the black president, Barack Obama calls for an open exchange of views on racial issues, many of them are untrusted in the eyes of the outsiders.
“We care deeply about how we tell our story,” said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who lived here all his life, and a member of the oldest church in the city.
“We need to say very well.
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, the historical model of black outlets is a community of almost 2400 people where poverty indicators reach the national average double.
In part, the literary node, and in part, an example of the result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, and black culture that blooms in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are proud and protective at the same time.
The picture of Eatonville is important since Zora, (that is why everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect, such as “Mules and Men” (1935) and “Their Eyes Were Watching God” (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The Florida Road Code has transformed the city, which is located next to the 17th road. This road leads to the history of black and human dramas from the long-lost center of Florida.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature, even the drum spray, introduced his readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: “From the road to the right we find modern public school, with a brown branch, carefully kept courts and playgrounds, which Howard Miller cares about, although he can hardly write and read,” he said.
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn sold all kinds of drinks and anything that could be needed in temporary accommodation.
So, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but at the same time with ignorance, remarry, and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guidebook has been presented differently.
This description really didn’t like everyone.
“Zora said things like they were,” said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls, and they were immortal by the fact that Hurston quoted the song that men sang about their beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like it.
Hurston is still remembered here as the elephant, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin reminded me that when Hurston came into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a glamorous Chevrolet, cigarettes, and in long-sleeved cities where people were even proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed, said Franklin, but many were fictional.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace looking at Lake Sabela, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he said in his chair: “I stayed too long.
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were not published again.
Most of the world seemed to have forgotten it, along with Eatonville.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant memories in Eatonville, or large, public readings.
“I don’t think they understand how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, “Infected in the cloud.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-band path through the city instead of the two-band main street, the Kennedy ray, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expansion of Orlto has already entered the Interstate 4 highways on the western border.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fights related to racial mixing inspired hatred with society.
“At the time, a team of white boys came over and threw their seats on the edge of the road with oranges and other things,” Franklin said.
“There was a lady who died in it.
They threw out a Greek doll from a car.
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court for violent integration. Thus, he said of the decision called ‘Brown v Board of Education’: ‘more insulting, in no way respecting my race’.
Today, residents say that the degeneration of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles, and humiliated the self-confidence of young people.
“The black kids used to kill them, and I remember that, the man treated his teacher in the morning and at night,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, director of the nonprofit organization called “We Celebrate the Eatonville Community.”
“It took time for students and teachers to come from a common place,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean, there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many others in the rise of Zora Neale Hurston – in black writers, actors and artists who have overexpressed prejudices, as he did, with such self-confidence and lines as follows: “How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
This is inexplicable for me.
In 1975, Alice Walker wasted a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked tomb and began fighting to return his reputation.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of bookshops, which once again brought him to America's role.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter again became the center of attention.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors looked at him as a rescuer.
In 1988, the community started organising a Hurston festival to show us what would ruin the county with its main road line.
Thousands of fans have come to the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the ceremony in January.
A few years later, the county stopped its road construction proposal.
“Because of the five-tracking of the main road, the community was reliving, fully connected to the speed, which means true civil pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said, “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
More and more people outside the city appeared, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to visit the church in 1993 and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-level library (naturally called Hurston) was opened, the refurbished and built on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville continued to be the cake of Florida: not only ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban sideway in the summer rain; it is as small as when the 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(90% of residents are black today.)
They still take caution over the outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission and some things, such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, which is represented by a white man painting and painting blacks on the ground, should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many – among other things, the self-confident Jones teacher who is particularly attracted to the bright red – fear that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has become more widespread, the pride of the home town has also grown.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: not better, better together with his wonderful, problems and everything, as proud, creative, anxious, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A real civil bond is silenced to Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to the local government after the college is completed, or to take a job at the police station to help him.
And it seems that the younger people have learned to properly describe Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin couple Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who only travel here think this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Alondra Kenon said recently after worship on Sunday.
“But if someone stops and takes a little time to know his history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
We all speak the language of finance in New York
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If the tourists didn't care about the newspaper bridges and the huge television shows on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with glass-walled, bee-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who hold power in New York have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still rolling through their metal handbags on the walks, carrying trays with muffin for breakfast meetings.
The men of Spanish lips are still claping among the blocks, carrying fifty-five-and-a-half of them as human muskets, which hang on a loop that is likened to their shoulders.
Office workers are still in line for breakfast’s sweet bakery at the dishes on the sidewalk, and it’s still impossible to take a taxi from 4 to 7 a.m. every morning.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I deliberately planned to do this in my local account of JP Morgan Chase, but there were now or 20 people in front of me.
Not at the banker window, where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I later learned from Starr, from the banker, who ordered me, were in line with the same intention as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was withdrawn from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives, and small-scale savings funds that operate only in one state and are allegedly treated as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have gone silently.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion capital, was bankrupt, and when New Yorkers came home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, made a savings savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers, afraid of another collapse, have transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, the bank that makes most of the capital injections out on Wall Street.
Simple New York people have become an expert in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman on her phone at the local Chinese store told me she went bankrupt from Lehman Brothers Bank and her super-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she was complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lynn, the uniform, fifty years of my apartment's household, changed the subject of care, not Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank: “I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not going to risk it.
Muslim tombs have been abused while Austria has signed on the right side of Austria
Heinz-Cristian Strache, from the left-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, Vlaams Belang, took part in a protest in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, on Thursday, on which the “Creeds of Islam” was presented.
They were drawn with signs that marked the mosques that crossed the red line.
According to the police, the extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the occupation of the Austrian Muslim cemeterys, which took place on the same weekend when the extreme right-wing parties have made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There were over 90 graves in the Traun Cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's Star, for example, for a few tombs, but according to the detectives, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives that come from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to elections in some way.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that “a great deal has been done,” the tomb of the tomb, which was not much before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
At the same time, Austria will hold a conscience examination after the elections in Parliament yesterday, during which the political balance language will go right.
The two extreme-right parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, were campaigned for the Future of the Freedom Party and the Association of Austria, for a strong anti-immigrant law, and some of their slogans were marked as critics.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, president of the Freedom Party for more than 18% of the votes, expressed the campaign against heads and bourgeois, and expressed his nocturnality with food allegedly related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, the party spoke of “European brotherhood,” which can prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and mercenaries, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
According to the polls and analyses carried out directly after the extreme winners, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glittert was banned from a foreign journey
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of rape of children, was banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months to notify the authorities of his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The U.S. police got the ban on the trip on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court on the rape of children against Glitter.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in the field, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court of Justice to prevent his travel to France and Spain by March 25.
“Paul Gadd didn’t show up in person”
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his foreign travel intention to do so because he is bound by the Act on Persons in the Register of Sexual Crimes.
You should inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned withdrawal.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent Police said they don't want to talk about the specific cases of Glitter County and its potential location.
“The Kent police are doing everything they can to protect children in the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to check someone if you don’t leave the UK because there’s a comprehensive system here that we can manage potential risks more efficiently.
\"The most important task of the police in Kent is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of offenders and in the county to minimise the potential risks to the population.\"
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for rape of a 10-year-old girl and a 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to travel to a plane in London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The country authorities did not pass the passport test, so they eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where the country police and immigration officials insisted to return to Great Britain.
Finally, he arrived at the Heathrow airport terminal on August 22, and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London court in Luxembourg, as according to Scotland Yard's request, he was admitted to the records of the perpetrators of sexual crime under a court order.
Glitter used to spend four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for taking photos of child rape.
According to a source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of State for Internal Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take pictures on stage, because I want to introduce the artist from a personal page – Günther Bauer Photo Artist
There's no decorations, no hairdressers, no dancing shoes.
The magisters of Flamenco from the body, without the excitement of the action: to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the insular, out of the audience, when we can find a personal movement, we can capture the depth of a captured look, or we can admire the beauty of the uninhabited, yet expressive hand of the artist who is not doing the stage action.
In his photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the theatre of singer, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less-known common page of the masters.
Through the photos, flamenco shows its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of flamenco day-to-day, believes the creator, adding that Flamenco-people would be anyone, as the observer, seeing the images, is surprised that these images are not typically portrayed by artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and rob the audience.
On stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character are the deepest of their beings.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to inherit the personality of the greats of the flamenco with the help of the camera.
The Cante de las Minas festival gave momentum to Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which portraits of Flemish singer, guitarist and dancers were made with a record camera.
Thanks to this camera and theme selection, classic photography is quoted.
However, the use of different stylistic tools is disrupted by traditional image representation and provides modernity. The following thought reflects Bauer’s idea of flamenco: “This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always impressive.
Not the dance, not the song or the music itself, but rather the artist's personality, character, magic the audience.
In the days, the leadership of the works in the El Fotomata Gallery is the search for the essence of the encounter with the artistic varas, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
The famous forms of Flamenco, including Diego El Cigara, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, will be metald with this photo collection of sixty artists.
The project also became a flamenco-antology, which will soon be released in a single album that fills the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits has been repeating the idea for two years with a series of “SportART project” of “Verteran athletes’ portraits.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different from that, the photographer adds: “I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, photography is the hardest genre in the portrait.
The fate of people you meet brings together people you sometimes don’t know, or only take a few minutes to photograph.
But in spite of these circumstances, I always try to achieve my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition, which was selected from the portraits of contemporary Flemishco, bearing the title of Flamenco-people, will be held in El Fotómata Gallery, in parallel with Alameda de Hercules, in the number 20 of El Fotómata.
According to Vargas Llos, the novel on which he works is “made blindness”
The site and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on a new novel. The main character of the novel is a Irish nationalist, Roger Cssen, who lived 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
At the Hay Festival Segavia event yesterday, a potential writer for the Imperial Nobel Prize admitted that his current work was “made for blindness” and “any sign that it should not be written,” the regent.
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it, and I hope I’m going to make a point at the end of some time,” he concluded, with these words, at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists for four days in the city of Aqueduct, as well as thousands of visitors.
“The city and dogs,” the author, was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he also replaced the hopes he had placed on it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award by the participants, Dickens “Our Dear Friend” for an old edition of his novel. His performance was performed by Juan Bravo Theatre.
The audience, after the welcome of Félix Romeo, was very busy. For the audience, the clock was soon followed, during which the writer of the Peruvian spoke with an amazing memory and a great amount of humor about how he developed his reading passion from his special adventure and the calling of life; how he bridges the lack of inspiration with the author’s method, with intense documentation, with many repairs and rewriting; how his influences on the profession of writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what his stories are built on.
The Latin-American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books changed our lives, but added: “I do not think that literature has a pure entertainment or a metaboliser experience,” because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to allow them to be tempted and held accountable to their profession.
Because of the weather, the good-byes in Pozoblanco are shorter, and the horse bulls are also missing.
Traditionally, the horse bully, held as the closing event of the Pozoblanco holidays, was removed from the show yesterday morning, after the upcoming horse-towers found that the arena’s field was inappropriate.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay behind the bullavia.
The weather crisis was thoroughly ruined by the series of celebrations, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, he stayed with the second bullavia.
The next major players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco, would have fought bulls.
It was only on Friday.
The winner Daniel Luque was brought home three ears as a trophy. After the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was brought to his shoulder.
In the same afternoon, Aljandro Talavante acquired a number of recognitions and trophyes, but it was more thanks to the audience rather than his own performance.
But after that, El Juli, who had little to contribute to aging of Los Llanos’ name.
After a comfortable journey with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get out of the sodra.
In his condition, a two-ton abdominal van tried to escape road control.
Four o'clock in 50 minutes.
The Basque Regional Police are conducting traffic checks in the administration of Armiñón (Álava).
The authority stops a van in which two travel. Passengers try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of abdominal tissue, at the same time it was not obvious.
The detectives persecuted the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man was arrested and identified as A. A. J., said the Basque Government Department of the Interior.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and copyright fraud.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Alava Forgalmi Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused obedience, suddenly gave gas, and then left the control site.
The detectives took him to the chase, then the vehicle stopped a few miles away on the stop bar, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after reviewing the Iveco Daily branded van, he seized his shipment of 2178 kilograms of abdomen.
In the rear part of the vehicle, the police bodies were transported to take a more thorough examination and to measure the drug.
In addition, it has been demonstrated during the verification that the vehicle’s false registration plate does not match the information contained in the truck’s papers, so that the arrested person is also subject to proceedings due to a breach of public document.
The Basel Regional Police are conducting an investigation aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, fled the highway and, on the other hand, defines the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old accused A. A. J. was sent to the police to conduct the necessary hearings, and then court measures started within a few hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested because he was under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara (Kalifornia) this weekend because it was under the influence of the drug.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking lot with strange maneuvers in Montecito, a spokesman for traffic surveillance in California told People magazine.
According to the witness, 16 hours around 30, Locklear pressed the gas, squeezed the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in front and back, and went back several times on his sunglasses.
Shortly later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because “he was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway.
“It seemed like aZavart,” the pilots took it to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and almost immediately excluded from alcohol consumption. The spokesman also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, she was thought to have been under the influence of Locklear.
Lockleart was arrested and arrested under the influence of an unidentifiable drug. Around 19 hours was transported to the local prison, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona Sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Federation of Adylus to deal with the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the IU, and the United Left representative of the United States, said today that the regional Federation of the region will make a decision on the issue of Youth and Sports Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of bringing his family members in return for his position.
“In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is indeed within the authority of the andelus organization,” Llamazares pointed out to the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the city council in Seville.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in the detection of irregularities that could be committed by Silva, the \"transparency\" should be observed: \"At IU has always reached a level in order to ensure maximum transparency in such matters.\"
He added that part of the training was \"for the public, the strict Code of Ethics\".
\"Mother blood, Garci epic
Benito Pérez Galdos National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who draws the Spanish famous anti-French uprising in the blood of May, which, with nearly EUR 15 million of its budget, was the most important creation of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis of his known novelist work. Today, in his film show Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the public audience of actors.
The blood of more than two and a half hours of Mayis is presented on Friday in the cinema, and later, Telemadrid will be presented as a miniserie for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdos' literature, made his childhood dream with this shot. All of this is due to Esperanza Aguirr, for he has been entrusted three years ago from Madrid County to prepare a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events of May 2. Garci accepted the request if the story is based on the National Epizors.
The 15 million budget was fully funded by the Autonomous Republic of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci to present “the confused Spanish who were at fault with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence has led the country to a huge failure with the rule of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
The director, however, expressed his regret about the fact that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's Phantoms who had fired more than double blood from May. It was therefore forced to leave a few scenes of the script, which, as many other times, were recorded with Horacio Valcárcell.
So he went to the usual work method of the director of the re-start, and he picked up the scenes with the actors he had already started the tests before the shooting. Casting was not because Garci thinks it’s “responsive,” and because, as he said, “the director’s mastership is part of the theatre and cinema to find out what’s going on in the industry we’re working on.
More actors in May’s blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, were not in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who can boast of four Oscars and an Oscar Award, believes that this year's year-on-year candidate for the Hollywood Academy, namely the Blood of May, the Seven French Billion Table and the Last-elected Vak Sunlights, is not represented by any young generation of Spanish cinemas,\" he said.
Garci's movie doesn't count as a prize.
“In this case, you think you’re working for the afterlife, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and finally you’ll be happy if your movie’s ready,” Garci said behind her 30-year-old professional career.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Flemish dancer in Seville also remembers a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia from the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of the andelus (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) moved to London at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and he struggled against wearing a fertilizer to prevent the freedom of women.
The dance and aesthetic revolution exploded in the war in Europe, and his life shocked Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pope Gamboa, and he advised me to be aware of Tórtolia, whose personality was really impressed.”
The Flemish dancer said: “It’s not our goal to tell the history of life, but to capture the spirit.
The titles of his dances came to mind flamenco styles.
For example, the dance of the ppilango, the guajira, or the dance of the snake, is the Tango.
“He danced and others say it’s also my style,” he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing again after the Open Door at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with an exceptional former student.
“Matilde transforms the older Tórtolia, the mature woman.
I’m glad you said yes to the request, it’s very honorable that you act in my play.
In addition, there are music directors and guitarists from Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Payaro's batter, Rafa El Viola's embroidery, and Juanfra Juárez, who \"plays a permanent character with the constant love of the real duret.
The piece also presents the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and even travels to a distant landscape at that time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remind him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but today he is no longer known and valued even less than his work,” Bayón said.
The show starts at 20 o'clock this evening at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of Triennium, the journal of a newly married poet appears.
The first illustrated edition of a newly married poet's diary will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation will be part of the programme series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of Andalus Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Imperial Nobel Prize and the anniversary of their two deaths.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are the closures of this work, the restoration of the international Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning poet's Memorial House and the “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree.” The exhibition opened in May this year, the exhibition was open, and it was planned to visit the New York International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalus Regional Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the reputation and work of one of the most widely married poets released by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso.
Without Paul Newman, it's not so attractive to America.
“God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like this.
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who was working with Newmann in the film “Despite of Sensation,” and reflects the shock and infidelity that Newman died in American cinema and caused throughout America.
How hard it is to get Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
And he was generally ill,
But he still ordered everyone to die.
“Sometimes inability to put our feelings into words, and now I have lost a good friend,” Robert Redford said in tears, “his existence made my life better and this country better.
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went away in a particularly dark period, which is reflected in the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the despair of American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go away and many people lose their virtues easily, and there are very few people we can look at, you don’t have to be Luis Cernus to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he educated the beauty and justice of the vision.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a protector of lost and won affairs, starting from the anti-drug foundation for the memory of his first son who died of drug overdose until the creation of a domestic biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was difficult to overcome in its eating culture.
The exhilarating wonder wave all over Hollywood went into nationalities and origins, regardless of its origin.
The last James Bond, according to the English Daniel Craig, was not a man, but a era died with him.
Another English, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newmann clearly meant the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia called Newman the biggest inspiration.
“He has made the laser very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today: they require honesty and a serious and camera-free private life.
It’s not always easy if it’s possible in the midst of today’s media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is his model.
He divorced once, but then lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and he would certainly have had many occasions for infidelity.
“Why do you have a hamburger somewhere else when the meat is at home,” he said.
In heaven, you may be proud that your daughter on earth is also a fan of what is not too common in America.
“One of all his designs was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted man-friendly role,” he said.
the Madrid Olympic Highway
Indeed, many of us have a dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 has failed, it may be 2016.
But, am I asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we're out of the race last night, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but, in my view, it was the worst of many I've ever been.
It was characterized by misconceptions, and if you had to evaluate it once, and I would be the tester, it would definitely be a failure.
But let's move on and start at the beginning.
The misconceptions began with the takeover of the number, because that was why they had to come earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including chips, to avoid a job later).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the serial number was handed over (first inconspicuousness, only so sooner to go there) and (after the usual line of work), how surprising it was, only the S T-shirt (second inconspicuousness, because I had the size of XL).
What world do we live in?
Or did they decide to save money because of the crisis and buy cheaper, smaller t-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still broken over the day of the race.
In addition to having to go over the chip at a terrible time, the job in the line lasted 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be given off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is understandable for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally managed it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made more pleasant than 40 minutes of waiting, which has been defined by folk uprising and stand attack attempts.
I think we'll get 500 sure pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, not our actual time.
If you asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't think of it by accident.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) reception
At the MIT Advanced Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to carry out some basic tasks. For example, he can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle in the area of the company) based on the information he hears from the conversation.
This “reception” is a camera and a form and facial recognition system that allows you to recognize how many people are in the room, who they – in fact, notes what clothes they wear - and hears and understands the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the present people on the basis of the discussions.
On the tutorial video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not part of the company that talks to her and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he came to visit someone and ensures that he will be in a hurry to help him soon.
All of this without the blue screen.
That's impressive.
This is the music of the future.
At present, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers run only the necessary programs instead of many commercial eyes, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
It was invented in Spanish, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
Change of direction will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google did the first step to be a Windows competitor.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element in the hardware and software dialogue.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to tell your mother something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will need to be counted with the “death” of the operating system, not absolute, but in relative terms.
Ballmer’s statement this week supports this thought.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, and more and more on the web browser.
We only turn on the computer to open Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and more and more time for browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the majority of applications with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 has less, much less to be at Vista.
Less difficult, less heavy, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services more on-line, and to ultimately report an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
At the beginning of the month, I made this photo in a meeting for Microsoft developers in Redmond.
A poster is called on by the company's browser. - \"Your browser. Our future \"
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft users used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009 but at the end of the year, but rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But slipping, considering that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will ruin their business.
Le Fabulex Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore this in the diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the main clothes of a grated gay customer community.
And if we're on the list of specialities, we can even recall the peaceful figure of the weight lifter of the M.C.C.
But what are we talking about? Not anything else, like, typically tight and unspoken, man's cotton trio.
In other words, the “tank” as the English-speaking person is called, but the rivals of the Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles cannot compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is among his friends only “Marcel,” which he can say thanks to the sport, he was named after Marcel Cerdan’s boxer, the singer of Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex tailoring, special emblém and a small (at least recognizable) Belgian flag also appear among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most prominent models in the neck of the shirt.
The Belgian company is not just making tank tops.
Sports fans, retro boxers, chamber curtains, wool pants, seacaps, babysitting, miniseries - and we can sort - are all of the products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Even though it is regrettable to wear them as a underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would like to be a young mother; no matter who the father is,”
He was very similar to his brother, and at the same time he managed to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is much more than giving some pretty and beautiful girls their name to something.
This was the promotion of the new Paris headquarters of Mango and the transfer of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's getting hot and gentle.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We will present Mango's new autumn-win collection, which we have designed with my brother, Pennalopa. In addition, we will participate in the second invitation to the Mango Fashion Awards and the gala dinner to honor Valentino in Opera.
It's a very busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at the Mango company, where did you draw inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the cinemas of the 50s and 60s; we took a lot of things from there.
And then, many times I walk the city and watch women dress up, how to change and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite time.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
I think so too, but in the end, these three things are linked, because there are a lot of points in them.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother, and I could hide in my aunt's closets.
Well, that was you on the Khan, he almost picked up a fun party.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to look at my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for hours and tests to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
In the role of the actress, you truly identify your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected to everything, and I respect the designers and their expertise.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women really get there, they've experienced enough and they're making less mistakes in life.
The biological clock is not worried.
I've been doing what I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and it's filled with great inner happiness.
And you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm a mother, because I was born as a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it.
As for the future father, no matter who it will be.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie last year, you've been shooting more movies that they haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I can't wait to get out.
I, who started in theatre, am impatient and restless, want everything right now, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can’t wait to show you the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you're saying to them...
Well, if I'm well aware, you've been debuting Naomi Campbell for a few days.
Well, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up as a model.
Naomi Campbell has long known me, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was arranged by her own, female organization for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes were auctioned and the amount was offered to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There are so many things that I know, and I can assure you that half of them are not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked me for a noble case, but if he wanted me to stand on his head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is the bet, I do not know impossible.
Returning drunk drivers will be required to install \"Alcolock\"
The Ministry of the Interior would require the car to install a structure that would prevent the start of the vehicle if the driver was in the condition of the drunk or not into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being addressed by the State Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
As the project aims to restore the market, the car driver will also have to take part in a repetitive course on transport education.
In the experiment, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Automotive Technology Institute (FITSA) are also involved outside the Finnish Transport Safety Agency.
According to statistics, 30-75% of people who have been arrested because of the drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle establishes the alcohol content of the air infused. If it is higher than permitted, or if the driver did not blow into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to be launched.
The cost of an instrument of more than 1000 euros would cost the offender.
A 2007 study in the USA showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 people every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual field, while the necessary criminal reform would require a basic amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form in the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which, for a French sample, calls for the installation of the system in school buses.
In Mexico, closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, he landed at 17 hours 40 minutes at the President of Benito Juárez airport in Mexico at the Spanish Air Force Heritage Party.
The sun was already down, but it was so firey that we could only see the royal party from the plane using our hands as an observer.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish Ambassador and other prestigious personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if the Spanish Hercegi Couple would come to the city for an official visit.
Well, great, then for a long time there will be no airport transfer today... a woman from here or something like that...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, she's just been here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Asturias Prince Party and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the airport hangar in red carpets, the order created by 27 sailors, who see the protection of dignity.
Herceg, smiled, in a sea blue dress, and then the Princess gets into her long hair in the wind, caught in clothes, but not in the usual shoes that flash her toes, she might be warned that Mexico City would be threatened by storm.
They stop and smile at the cameras for a moment, and then enter the room where the official bet comes from.
In the gates of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are expected to be the reporter of one of Mexican television’s sorcerys.
The Most Valued Fashion Award
The most suitable place in the world for the award of fashion is Paris, and today’s fashion designers are the most sophisticated and most definitely Valentino.
Mango recently announced El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to internationalize the young talents of fashion.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the first competition Belgian winner of the Paris Boulevard Haussmann 54 Mango, saw his own design clothes, and without a little bit of tears from the power.
By the way, this is the second largest European business of the company and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest deal is in London.
We finally found ourselves on a luxury dinner in Garnier Opera, Paris.
In the company of the most vibrant Chagalok, the president’s table for galavacsós Mango showed even more spectacularly.
Nati, who, due to his recent death, came with a heavy heart and sorrow, wore one of the company’s pieces and some breathtaking jewels of ELAH. He accompanied Valentin with his son Luis nearly two meters high, and accompanied him to the dinner main table for his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, had fun with the guests. The bar at Rothill, they were so knightly at the university that they eventually stayed without a suit because they were both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own design pants and shirt, and at dinner he wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera visit to Gaya Toledo, he was so excited in the ballet room that the old times were born into one of the bars and a grand pencil lined up.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but he showed a few photos of his son before him.
The next morning, we were delighted at Oliver Martinez - he was going to be two meters tall and motor - and John Travolta also arrived at the hotel at the Intercontinental in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he told him not to ask for any illusions.
Stars under the Paris Star Age.
Oh là là, c'est la.

Those who speak in dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I am not thinking of those who wake up and tell them completely what happened to them that day, but about those who speak during sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary to the first, but it is actually harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
Very common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've been told that he's been talking at night.
The frequency can be completely rapsodic (for example, only once in a high fever illness), or more systematic (day, weekly or monthly) and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
His appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
Often it is combined with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-rise, night bedbeds (enuresis nocturna) or sleeping, but it is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, a state of high fever, or even stress, or an accompanying phenomenon of elevated excitement, can be mentioned.
However, few studies have been made so far.
The intensity of speech is also very varied.
It may be quiet, calm, may consist of unrelated words, bloating, but unlike all this, it may also occur in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and contact a specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety in the background and can therefore offer a solution.
As we have already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, therefore there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by a different, manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, we can do a few things, see a pre-morning measure:
Let us note that the child stays calm before bed.
Choose calm games and avoid the child from watching scary or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or more difficult to relax, we teach some relaxation methods to find inner tranquility easier.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If he starts talking while sleeping, we try to keep the rest of the work.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they will remember nothing.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child has no consciousness, but he'd run out of sleep.
Even though he speaks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if you have a lot of anxiety to accompany the phenomenon, turn to a professional, or find out what triggers a great deal of anxiety from the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking them to find out anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, because during sleep it is not so conscious that you can take your thoughts together.
On the other hand, you will only hear the speech, but you will not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the heard and any conclusions.
Never tell the child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This has caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, Illhaeusern's team finally took a new momentum and won again on the home track.
Although there was no flawed match, the yellow-blacks were once again placed in a situation where one of them could finally win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers were hard to feel the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was accompanied by Captain Kauffmann of the guest team, but the remote ball just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. After that, Illhaeusern took up and followed each other by shoots: Funderflick tried a remote shot, and Hirn shot above the gate. Romain spötl and Diebold also tried to inspire Dannemarie to protect him with a remote experiment.
On the other side, players put themselves in a block, protected on the middle track, and only the heir Riahi was placed in a shooting position.
At the beginning of the second semester, Riahi and Temporale were first placed on the Dannemarie side. After that, he was born with the first goal: after the first shot of Diebold, the ball was taken out by an excellent position by the illhaeuserni Marais, and then put it into the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalkeeper could not enjoy the glory for a long time: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue their struggle in human poverty.
Dannemarie, however, couldn’t take advantage of his advantage: they didn’t cause much trouble to the domestic team, who just pulled a little back to strengthen their defense. Only the last few seconds kept some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a flight to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by the fishermen affected the traffic of several breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the Port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised that the president would be accepted in a constructive spirit, and expressed their interest in saying that Sarkozy would come with concrete proposals.
The president’s visit is at the same time at the meeting of the “Value Committee” set up by breton fishermen with a view to initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average record price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, the President of the Republic, said that the president will discuss with the fishermen what solutions could help companies to regain their competitiveness and make them safer for seafarers working conditions and wages.
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
Tuesday morning, traffic slow demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, with which there were nearly 10 km of congestion.
They also damaged the traffic of the Quiberon yacht, but the roads towards Belle-île were not closed.
The Quiberon was located in the peninsula.
On Monday, sailors have proven their determination. At that time in the morning, tires and pallets were lit in front of the fuel crates of the Brussels ports, while protests were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. In the Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships prevented the traffic of commercial ships.
The La Turballe and Le Croisic fishermen located in the county of Loire-Atlantique have eliminated the huge oil-refining block in Donges.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held at the Ministry by decision of further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the Board of Appeal must decide on its next step and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some breton fishermen do not wish to represent their interests as leaders of the national fisheries committee, since the Committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Loient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying about 50 cents for liter, but believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gas oil would fall below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
“Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid,” an unforgettable addressist at the home of Connecticut, was 83 years old due to death as a result of cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes have also paid their respects to the actor Paul Newman, who died at age 83.
Embraer does not change its transport plans in 2008.
Despite the crisis that threatens the global economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is able to keep plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 – confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company accounts for the Chinese market, in particular for 30-120 aircraft.
Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG sells more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which was set up by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay $85 billion in advance, announced the release of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international-level life insurance and US pension insurance activities, the AIG would be disparate from a large part of almost all other businesses, the newspaper explained the sources that were close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors agreed on Sunday night to examine the possibilities of sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset stock you want to sell by AIG includes an aircraft leasing company called International Lease Financial Corp, a 59% share of Transtaltic Holdings’ reinsurance company, as well as real estate portfolios and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, the paper says there is no final decision on sales yet.
AIG must be able to access liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. Government. By doing so, it will take the risk that it will have to become 80 % of its capital and lose its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
Study of Paris Historique on the Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historical decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson Banking Plan. The Dow Jones Index fell down by 6.98% (which never seen nearly 800 accurate reductions), and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) was reduced by 777,68, so it closed at 10 365,45 points.
The biggest decline in the index (684,81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001 when trade was re-registered after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq, built mainly on technology papers, was closed at 1,983,73 points, while the index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded by 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) fell to 1,105,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock exchange was also weakened at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore the market balance, it began to fly deep.
Members refused to provide the funds requested by Henry Paulson’s Minister of Finance with a vote of 28 votes to 205 votes.
Almost two thirds of the Republicans have taken the plan.
“This market is filtering down bad signs, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” says Lindsey Pegza, FTN Financial Analyst.
“It seems to me that the market was waiting for this plan,” he added, and then expressed his concern that if a few days later they would accept such a plan, it would be “too late.”
“If the plan is truly condemned to death (...), then at Fed (American Central Bank - the drug). And the other central banks will have a line to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to deepen,” says Brian Bethune, the leading economist of Global Insight.
In order to further enhance the sense of urgency, Pegza adds: “A new and new financial institution will go bankrupt in the United States every day.
After Washington's Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking operations were purchased by the rival, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has taken urgent measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is not only an American but also a global crisis,” adds FTN Financial Analyst.
The bond market has been significantly satisfied.
The 10-year-old state bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% for Friday night, and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% for the previous day.
Obama won the first television match
The two American presidential candidates followed their first debate on Friday, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama will be released as a winner.
In no surprising way, the Republican and Democratic campaign’s leaders have both said the victory in the television party that was followed by one-third of the American households.
According to David Gergen’s political analyst, although John McCain’s action was respectful, he did not prove enough to stop his popularity from falling: this is demonstrated by five weeks of polls before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is better in the fight: according to the results published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
39% of those who are most likely to be asked will win Obama, while 25% of them will win McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner Joseph Biden's promising Thursday role. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: “It would be fun to underestimate Palin.
He has good feelings.
McCain, who has been in the 1970s, will never entertain his own, undisturbed foreign policy experience. He stresses his opposition to \"Navitation,\" in those issues that have been at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“It seems, Senator Obama doesn’t understand that,” the attack said several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position,” McCain said.
This is the main attack surface that has been used by Republican TV ads since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he did and did not say exactly.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama has already cut back the weekend-wide Democratic Ad, which puts it in the eyes of the Republican leader, that he still hasn’t measured the impact of the crisis on the U.S. people.
“In ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who gathered together in a separate election meeting in North Carolina.
He did not even put out the words of the \"General Class\" or \"workers\" in his mouth. The confusion in the financial world is undoubtedly in favour of Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy at the edge of the collapse.
“The next seven turning points can be proved,” said Charles Schumer, a prominent Democrat senator.
Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat of Clinton's government, said Obama's economy has such excellent instincts as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.
The Ilinois senator reiterated that despite the fluctuations in stock exchange, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that, among his primary objectives, the creation of possible energy independence of the country by using renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system is amongst its main objectives.
McCain plans to install 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidents carefully excluded the questions relating to the banking plan of $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: “They have noticed that the election was taking place here.
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday night at the capital of the capital of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of whites gathered on Minsk’s main square after the closing of voting venues, to protest against the overthrow of electoral results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young protests against President Alexandre Lukasenko are as follows: \"Dictator, please cancel.\"
Some people admit that they didn’t even go to the vote: “Why would I go? They’re doing what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to demonstrate itself in good color before foreign observers for the purpose of establishing a link with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic shift.
If the elections were considered clean, they would be able to remove sanctions on the country, which would deny the visa from 40 Belarusian leaders, and some bank accounts would be frozen.
The opposition, however, said the elections did not take place clearly.
“We were held from election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote,” said Jurij Potyemkin, who was organized from the twelve parties, so heterogeneous of the United Democratic Forces Coalition.
“The changes were only nominal,” said Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. “The point is that he is counting the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition enter the parliament, it means that they were appointed and not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to get space on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit proposals for legislation.
The opposition must therefore take a colour in political life, because \" dialogue with the European Union must be launched\".
In the same way, if our heavily-sold economy against Russia is in crisis and we are not able to renew it, we are risking that we will be under the control of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition is afraid that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the election process, will accept the outcome of the vote.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high and the wide organisation of the pre-election (26% of voters participated in Minsk) allowed any manipulation.
“The President noticed that the election took place here,” said Alexander Kozulin, leader of social democracy, who was finally released from prison in August this year as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
There will be up to five opposition representatives in Parliament, and those who are most in line with leadership.
The silence of the night is back on October Square.
On television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee will be happy.
Blood is safe again
Hema-Qubébec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his founding yesterday. President Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate because Hema-Qubec has become one of the world's safest and most effective blood sales companies.
And most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of people, which seriously inspired the effect of the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood reserves treated by the Canadian Red Cross’s blood supply service were infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, the government of Canada launched an official investigation by Judge Crover Horace Krever, following drama and general orientation. It was designed to reveal the circumstances that led to the tragedy and put forward proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever submitted his delayed report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood-sighting services were established in Canada: one is the Hema-Québec serving Québet, and the other is the Canadian Vérelő Society responsible for the supply of all other provinces and the two territories.
“When Hema-Qubébec began his activity in 1998, almost 38 percent of people had confidence in the blood system of Québec,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
“In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we managed to regain the confidence of people,” said Décary proudly, nearly 94% of the population in Quebec at the beginning of 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “the trust is a very fragile thing.”
Hema-Qubec has been using the precautionary principle since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe in which keel disease, i.e. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has also been infected with new variants of people,” the doctor says, who has been managing the company since its establishment in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease would spread through the blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. In this case, if we are uncertain and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which causes the brain to change, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
A few years ago, it was found that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.
In 1999, a technique published on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which is directly able to show itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than anti-virus antibodies, to which the tests used previously were built.
With the NAT test, we can shorten the window tradition, which keeps the virus from infection until we can show the virus in the blood through our technical devices, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to a shorter period than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk that blood donors could infect the blood and not show it.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting blood infected with HIV virus is 12 million to one.
“In other words, this means that we should share 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
As Hema-Qubec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years to get a case like this, and someone infected with HIV virus through a blood preparation.
I think that anyone can accept or write blood transfusions today to restore health, says the first leader of the Hema-Qubec.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens are going into the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must remain alert,” continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that, apart from the emergency reserves, the Hema-Qubébec should provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“In the ageing population, the needs are also growing.
As anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the number of blood taxes, as the number of people on the network makes up only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years of age, can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood, for example, they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood transfusion for a year.
“There are 3 percent of our reserves that we can meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to get out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood vessels to the extent that the existing ones are getting older, because they can't give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult for people to convince them to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood vessels.
In today’s rushing world, there’s hardly one hour of man to give blood,” says Francine Décary.
Hema-Qubec, an annual budget of $297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart implants, eyelash tissues and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for people who have been severely burned.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen, and then placed at the Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The hair can only be obtained as medical waste from a gynaecologist that is rich in stem cells, thus also allowing for the treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“Some weeks ago, we celebrated the transfer of thousands of new samples to our bank.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably begin to offer these to organ transplants,” confirmed Dr. Décary, who says that the Köldeksinóróv-departure program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are sad because they don’t have the opportunity to do so,” he said, “that’s true, because Hema-Qubébec has no way to make this complex and costly program available to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders by 3:1 yesterday in the U.S.L.-1, and the combined 4:3 result came into the premiere. This was a crucial match for the quarter-finals and the results that was held at the Saputo Stadium.
Antonio Ribeiro won the final goal in 90 minutes.
While it was the first half-time without a goal, in the second, the two midfields of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found in the net of the opponent.
Only Roger Levesque managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Remember that at the first match on Friday, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, the Thunder team in Minnesota, which won from Whitecaps to 3:1, won 4:3, however, the Whitecaps came into the predecessor with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In Diohhej - Kovalev winner goal
Canadiens' favorite tris are ready for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec, and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally, Canadiens won the Florida Panthers against 3:2 at the Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the first number one star of the meeting, won a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev closed the match with a golpass, which was the fourth win from the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who acquired the only goal of the shot.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian player warned.
“There’s another game to really feel like I’m feeling like,
“He tried to get a lot out of himself in the first third,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“But I think the final result of the game was happy.
He had a huge innovation.
Charest's Northern Goals
The Prime Minister will not deny that the election will begin this year.
At the end of the meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest has already traveled to the Québeci Jean-Talon, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, has gone to victory in the interim election to be held today.
“Restraining our last great northern border,” Jean Charest said at the last meeting of the Liberal Party in Quebec in Légis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but the president tried to focus on the point.
During his performance, he was behind his back with pictures similar to \"Moulin à images\".
The three massively impressive recordings followed each other: the barriers of hydropower plants, mining, Quebec on “Google Maps, Maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister was not willing to guarantee that the election will not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule would be very tight.
“The plan, on the fourth pillar of the Government’s future of Québec, is a “new economic area”. This includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of agreements planned with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at the level of 49) was often presented in the speeches of the Prime Minister, but the presentation has never been held on this topic.
However, the Head of State has only called on him to explain why he considered North as a treasure mine full of enormous opportunities, but he did not talk about time factors, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: primarily water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, further boosting the growth of the catching countries and the reconstruction of state infrastructures.
In the north there are nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.
This area, which is “two times the size of France,” is the area of Québec, our territory.
Not only are we, but we are in it, the head of state repeated, stressing that it wants to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Québec’s development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the golden valley in Abitib, the québec design work, the James Bay...
“This is our future,” he added, after looking at the huge map behind his back in a stage break.
The northern area of Quebec includes a portion of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for himself, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
“This is our historical resolution, which all governments have confirmed.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when it comes to it, I confirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our perspective on the North,” the Prime Minister said about the Northwest passage that opens up every year as a result of the collapse of Arctic ice.
In the view of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, it is an important task to occupy the area.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec pays great attention to them, and they will benefit much from the plan, especially for young people.
Two ministers, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, who were the last ambassador to Parti Québécois, have already started to negotiate with about thirty local societies.
Benoît Pelletier also led the inter-ministerial committee, in which Juliet Boulet (Ministry for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they create a common vision.
Northern development would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘visio’ as in line with the ideas of previous liberal prime minister.
“Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges.
This was one of the recurring topics for the weekend that started with the 50th anniversary of the election of Jean Lesse as a party president on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be crossed into the Adélard-Goodbout barrier.
“Our politicians, including Godbourg, the founder of Hydro-Québece, Lease, and the national expansion of hydropower plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, knew how to shake the future,” Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he also quoted another - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister Roads to the North from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Water Power Plant, President Charest stressed that the deployment would be planned by 2012.
“This stays between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his callers and accepted his statement by a loud Tapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law will allow.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full, as he was carrying out tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Québec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to set up nationalist decisions, which were almost without thought. In particular, there is a need for recognition in the Constitution of the Liberal Party in particular of \"Qubec's particular character\".
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
However, the opposition took the main points of the North Plan skeptically.
Paulina Marois, head of Parti Québécois, re-elected the North Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in 2003 has rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn’t done it, “We’d hold much sooner,” said Mrs. Marois in agreement with Mrs. Françoise Mercure, who was a candidate for the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the Government’s acceptance of the North Plan.
“But we want it to be a simple play,” said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Records - A Coiled Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper's Cabinet (in particular, Minister of Justice) last summer, took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada's \"mother\".
Thus, to shame a woman who has fought for the truth and deserves all of our admiration – it tells us a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is, therefore, our government, who has not delivered its own citizen from the Guantanamy concentration camp in some of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he suffered.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, refused to say so and lets a child's war be smoothed under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that does a puppet show of justice while investigating the guilt of a accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also demand the return of Omar Khadr to obtain a fair procedure in Canada.
And our government has lost sight of the tour: it doesn’t matter that a young adult has been completely destroyed, and that many years of torture has probably sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently under-democracy of our rights, freedom and democracy.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: they can easily be beaten, tortured and imprisoned by any Canadian citizen, according to the authority of a government leader, who was in a minority until now (and what can come after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that honors the Force, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is on foot to impose on the values that our country has given thanks to its good news and dignity.
Dear Toews, the shame is more of this - don't look elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwell
In Le Devoir's 17th September, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President-in-Chief of Barrick Gold Mine, Canada.
Following Orwell's development, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a $6 million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company for an initiative called \"public dispute\".
Even though judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in defamatory cases, are not made by truth, but by law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way to make a public debate to destroy anyone who is opposed to his own position?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada should spend significant amounts of money on defence and fight in an uneven fight where lawyers supported by the sources of mining on the other side stand.
In such an uneven struggle, however, it is often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement that not only silences the opponents, but also scares those who try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public opinion.
Although in a number of other countries where Barrick Gold operates, it happens differently in Canada, the parties in the dispute generally do not hit each other with a stick but tell their thoughts.
Therefore, it would have been enough for the mine to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have revealed light to the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public opinion, and with a move, he misinterpreted the requests and letters written in the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a “public” debate if at the same time he took this public opinion into account?
In the Deputy President's mind, this word is probably just a cheap-paid lawyer, not a total nationality of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus very narrow.
In a democratic state, even other people are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand it - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a court of silence for many. (In the case of the “public dispute”, Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this phrase.)
In addition to Garver's surreal development, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which is the building blocks of all democratic societies.
In full, the procedure denies the right to quote authentic resources, to dispute facts and interpretations which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could be done according to the scientific standards that Noir Canada authors apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have been able to handle disputes, differences of views and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s impeccable procedure shows that, contrary to his claim, he is not in favour of conducting an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada. It is time for governments to take measures to limit the legal procedures initiated for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Democratics and Republicans
The Presidents of the Bush Government and Congress Republican and Democratic Democratic Republic of Congress finally agreed on the economic rescue operation, which since the Great Economic Crisis in the 1930s has been the biggest such plan.
The $700 billion US dollar plan, aimed at curbing the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Important points of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to recover the planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to the failure of payments; access right to pay the managers of assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives and Judd Gregg, was announced yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon talks ended.
“We have made a great deal of progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
“We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street,” the Democratic Representative said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, then there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans,” Judd Gregg said.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, afraid that another failure would have a detrimental impact on the mood of investors.
The agreement was reached by the stock exchange until the opening of the morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations later showed willingness to reach an agreement, however, they were not happy with the fact that the situation had grown to the end.
The Senator Barack Obama owns the provisions on the expansion of the agreement with elements such as the preservation of household ownership or the payment of the management of the companies assisted by the State.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibleness of other people, it’s not too enjoyable.
These steps are necessary, however,” he noted on a television show in the United States.
When John McCaint asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, “I would like to know the details, but I hope so.”
“What I’ve read in great lines shows that it’s something we all need to digest and that we can move on.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, the taxpayers’ money would be purchased by the U.S. financial institutions with duplicable claims, something risky, unselling assets.
The plan was preceded by a crisis that took place for a period of 14 months, which led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (second-term mortgage loans) and then to other credit-related (trade) securities and ultimately to the freezing of liquid funds and the accumulation of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives dropped the first draft agreement last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain \"toxic\" tools of companies in difficult situations would rather be provided by the government rather than purchased by the government.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, it would first cost a $250 billion detail; this could be followed by an additional 100 billion if the President considered it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion will have to be approved by Congress by another vote.
In return for assistance, Washington acquires a share in supported companies, making it a dividend of profits and which can be sold after the crisis is down.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the reservation of mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it may impose the maximum value of remuneration and compensation to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like to see the plan to be voted today by the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is not yet certain that the plan will be approved.
The same yesterday was repeated statements against the plan, both among Republicans and Democrats.
“It’s quite clear that Washington doesn’t hear your voice,” said Republican Scott Garret, a member of the house’s financial committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would favour taxpayers.
Brad Sherman, a Democrat leader in the \"Sceptic Group\", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Forty hundred excellent economic professionals, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress: don’t hurry and thoroughly examine which path he chooses,” Sherman said.
In Europe, it was once again understood that it was a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would state part of the Fortis banking group in a value of EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have been in need of the notification of the French BNP Paribas, not buying a competitor on the edge of the bankruptcy, after 2 million euros (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) have been lost as a result of the crisis of secondary mortgage credit in the United States.
With Fortis's 85,000 employees, the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurance companies.
“This is not a waste of money,” said Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss yesterday.
“We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.
On the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank that has been affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total of the ongoing loans of the Bradford and Bringley Bank, out of which the real estate loans make 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion U.S. dollars).
The Spanish Bank of Santander announced yesterday that they would purchase the British bank’s subsidiaries and customer stock.
Bradford and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government wants to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Congratulations to the actor
The eyes of beautiful azours, some say, were the most important impact card, others say, had the highest weakness.
Have you ever been released from the Narcisic mirror by a sarly American actor?
Yeah, not at all.
Through its shame, sensitivity, and cohabited talent, it also stood far from it the gray style, which is the spirit of the real great monuments of the art world.
But what a huge path he ran!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at the birth of Connecticut, one of the last icons of American cinema flower age.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, who was like him, and who was long-awaited to be a rival in the film election. In his eyes he was more reluctant and undoubtedly vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and destruction of dramatic conventions.
There are often extraordinary children from the mix of blood.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio, a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which only increased his merits.
In fact, he was a fan of his “self-made man” idea and the battler idea in the Pacific War. At the beginning of the 1950s, Yale studied at the drama of the University, and then at the Actor’s Studio in New York before the theater, television, and much later on the world of cinema.
In addition to being a professional driver of civil rights, in 1979, he was second ranked in the Le Mans 24-hour race. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had lived in a happy marriage with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what the shadows of this mysterious, closed, job-driven actor who hated show business. This is always a mystery.
He was a real man, in the best sense of the word.
At the end of the week, Paul Newman's death shocked cinema lovers: in his great roles, we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Over the course of our life, the seventh American art, directed by constant changes in cinema for over fifty years.
In our memory, “Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid” are mixed with a slim cowboy (1969) and a nervous young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), in whose role we saw the “Macska on the hot palm roof” in Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From recent times (1990) we can remember in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age by not having his marriage replaced his hopes.
Paul Newman has seen a lot of other faces in his films.
In his film Robert Wise “Valaki up there,” the angry criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, released an unforgettable transformation in his role. This was originally a role for James Dean, and after his death, Newman began his career as an actor in 1956.
He also played a sympathy criminal in the brilliant work of the Great Balhe, which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
In his brilliant film Robert Rossen, the Svindler, (1961), formed a cumbersome billionaire player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorpese’s film “The Color of Money.” In 1987, he received a single Oscar award from nine nominations.
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The change of age marked the period of his career.
The youngsters are primarily known for George Roy Hill’s “Jermans” cult film (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a ice hockey team, is not being shaped by a coach working with conventional methods.
His Rajongos were seen in 1994 by Coen’s cousins, the Great Jumper.
The film Sam Mendes, entitled “The Way of Damage,” closed in 2003, last appeared in the role of a Irish mafia chief.
Unlike a lot of cinema legends who left the film election relatively soon, Newman stayed in the reflector light for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood along with its squealing, lighting and imagery.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, considered not all humors as “the living chafolata of the underplay,” said the game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always graceful with the handsome Paul Newmann, who for a long time only fell in his lap of film.
Still, he played a lot of young and successful characters: rather, he formed fictions living in the periphery of society - a neurobetic, alcoholic, malicious or hopelessly lost - whose hair loss and rebellion could be restored with perfect credibility.
As director, Newman showed a less well-known face: the heart of his soul is truly an eye-catching and sensitive man.
In 1968, he drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the main role with his wife Margaret Laurence, a Canadian writer, Joanne Woodward.
In 1984, the film “Harry and his son” and his son, who died of drug overdose, reminds Scott.
Yesterday, Newman’s numerous honors remembered the actor. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom Robert Redford (in the great balhe) and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” played together) said, “His presence made my life better and the world better.
The joy of generosity and being: This was the secret of this great actor’s vibrating personality, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent film production, and Hollywood's clashes are diverted.
We’ve often seen his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with quite bad mouths, though at first he thought it was funny.
However, income from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his beards: he remained committed to the profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote: “Your father always and forever immeasurably grateful for his happiness.
It was a privilege for me to be here.
It is also a privilege for us to be accompanied by such a brilliant and generous American artist’s career.
He was a citizen, above everything.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai’s account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal proceedings against John Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused of fraud and other crimes, including indictment of law.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often certified by unrealised accounts.
Public and municipal funds, in total, were partly transferred to the Youth Left’s Cat, partly into the pocket of some people.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the funds received were taken up on the basis of cost accounts that were behind which there was no actual performance and that the associations had never complied with the undertaking.
According to the charges, most of the accounts were false.
In this well-zed city market, they got the account blocks, and the circulars were manufactured on Kiskunhalas.
Which companies would be called the account production, including on the Balaton region tour to which John Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look at both our families and restaurants.
He asked for an account of his consumption, which was then drawn up on the sample, including the accounts to be submitted by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour register, and to the proposals of the capital government.
In most of these, István Lados noted with his partner, Mr. Andrá, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports necessary to obtain the aid.
One of Lados’ studies was a beer house.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlages in 2003, the hospitality facility provided a meal for the ninety-person group of the Commissioners of the United States.
However, according to the company manager’s claim, they would not have been able to access the guesthouse at the same time.
The same for the Better Future - later together with the Third Year - the Foundation issued an account in the summer of 2002 from formal and content error.
A badacsonyomaji pension was only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, but the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, fantasia-adults were overstated even when Pigal Kft., which, according to the information provided to the prosecution, was not included in the documents for Better Future and Hoppa.
The head of the company, Farkas Győtó, told Hvg.hu that when they called in the prosecutor's office and showed him accounts, he immediately knew it was about false documents.
“In the wrong place, the name of our company and our tax number was displayed in the stamp.
He added: “In addition to formal reasons, it was not clear that hundreds of people were settled in the account, because they have a total of eleven rooms in which there are not so many places to fit.
In addition, the account also talked about eating, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The encouraged accountmakers did not follow either the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they looked like, only organizes foreign roads, so that the travel service in Hungary was nominated as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not match the company’s accounting practices.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, the VAT was included in the document, where travel activities in countries outside the European Union were not VAT-free.
Among other things, the VAT rate has been incorrect on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfürp Kft. for the Right Future, since the company’s service is not charged by the specified 25 % VAT, but by the staff of the hotel only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the ‘producers’ accounts were also compromised by the fact that a company was designated as a road freight transport activity by means of the prosecutor’s procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on the original investment advice.
In addition, due to formal differences – insufficient account format, not real stamping – the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the XXI-Saaaad Cultural Association and the Security Point were fake.
Just like Ravenna Bt. or the Haférto Sports Camp, which had been denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that he was at the time when he was a group of young cities there, which is why the company's liquidator - we know, denied that he had filed the paper.
They made it consciously.
The other group of account issuers is made up of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists.
The head of Collab Ltd., according to the charges, has been charged by one of the defendants, George Ludovic, to issue a fictional account.
He also collaborated with Zuschlagek with Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 was the Foundation for Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Redeemer Association, with accounts of five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No cash movement, because the completed accounts were then resorted, but these organizations have already forgotten to present it in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to those who can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the managing officer of Delta Trió Kft., who was based in Budapest, was Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computing devices, with a value of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these accounts have been purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., a small branch that has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company had the CEO of a Romanian man who, as well as Ivan Kubatov, would have forwarded the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
In the course of the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he issued an account on behalf of the Kft, to Atlas, Hoppa and to the Third Year Foundation together, and to the contrary.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stone builders founded Fa-Bani Jos Wood Industry Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies worked, which, according to the defendant, was the reason they did not get a job.
However, he took advantage of businesses because he was a accused partner, at the request of St. Zsolt, who made the documents of the company’s foundations, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 accounts to organizations in value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor said that 10% of the amounts included in the invoices and the VAT hit Cubatov's mark.
The man even used the Si-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fiction accounts, which were manufactured for the application of the Insurance Pont.
The Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary in January 2006 submitted an application to the public-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, the Dance Society Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won between 500 and 500 000 forints, but the amounts were not translated for the purposes indicated in the contest.
In order not to find out, the five fictitious accounts received from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found in the house search of Árpád Kemecsei in his office at the educational store.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as he did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the course of accounting production.
The most interesting thing is if you are the first-rate defendant, John Zuschlag decides to make the veil look like anything else.
His testimony to this day is not too detailed, and though he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether the socialists had a deal with him in order to do so, perhaps in most of the damage, in the head of the 50 million forints, and the socialists had a deal with him, and Zusi would take the fall.
Anyone who could have been offended today, for his detention to alleviate the circumstances of his condition, i.e. his requests for house arrest, were constantly found in deaf ears.
While the victims of non-exhaustive economic crimes can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the procedure against them in their own homes, they have no opportunity to do so.
Psychology of Overlicitation: Why Do We Give More Money?
At the auction, buyers tend to give more money, overestimate the goods.
This well-known and seemingly irrational behavior has been discovered by neuro-economics researchers at the University of New York.
According to a study published in Science, people don’t want to fall under a type of competition, such as eBay’s auction, so they pay too high a price.
The study tried to map the e-play – neurosystemal pattern using experimental auctions.
One of the volunteers was lotteryd, the other group played an auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method examined the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which the other party's over-licitation - the complex under the striatum, under the brain corrugated, was intensively operational when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the nervous system’s “remuneration” mechanism.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of striatum.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research group also carried out a financial follow-up investigation.
In this three groups have been lit against a partner in different circumstances.
With the control group, they simply reported how much the real value of the product in question and they had their bets.
In addition, another group has promised that if they win out of the game, they will get another $15.
The third group, however, received just $15 before auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of a losing auction.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was that for one of them the winnings, the loss was emphasized for the other.
However, as evidenced by the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team who played against loss were willing to hold a higher stake than the control and absorption group.
“These results cannot be derived from the theory of any previously existing economy.
It has been explained by the joy of victory and the risk-taking of auctioning phenomena.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we have now reached a third explanation,” Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
The number of hepatitis-infected people at home can be increased to one hundred times, but only seven thousand are treated, for which reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is called a collection of infectious liver products caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there are many similarities, characteristic of inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the nutrient channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (swelling, vaginal discharge, swallowing).
Travelers should be protected against A and B virus, with no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the whites of the eye, the stool becomes clear, the urine becomes dark, and healing can last for two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die in a more severe type of disease, liver cancer and liver sugar caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected will receive medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may also lead to liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease because the pathogen destroys the liver’s cells thoroughly, and in many cases only in 20-30 years the first symptoms occur.
Thus, it is very important to early prevention, to carry out regular screening tests.
In three groups, the average number of such diseases is much more than the average: between people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus can currently be 200 million in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth turning to your home doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, recognizing the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating infection and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was first held in 2004 by patient organisations throughout the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to the importance of chronic hepatitis, causes of development and early recognition of the disease.
If you believe in God, does it hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith works as a kind of pain-relief, which has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how the godhood affects people’s perception of pain, announced the British Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were awarded in electronics, while all of them were studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of deporting human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first of a research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians are involved in different parts of the university.
The test was done precisely by strengthening a rocking device to the left hand of the experimental subjects that provided the electro-block.
The researchers asked the participants to take a strong look at two paintings, the Virgin Mary of Sassoferrato, and Leonardo da Vinci, who was painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among the believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was considered to have a relaxing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts, while either looking at a religious topic or a general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe,” as they were concerned, and “satisfied, filled them with peace.”
While watching the religious image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was seen in front of himself.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even with atheists, should only be found in the appropriate photo.
“We should find a picture of whom they feel very positive like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, it is only the question that if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter present a picture of a Madonna to believers, how would it affect their pain control?
Would the view of the quality Virgin Mary have better results?
You are what you share.
On his tenth birthday you can tell Google: at least as many people can find in people’s pockets as they are above their heads in the sky; you know where they are vacationing, what kind of specializations they are and what they are interested in.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, one of the company's main people.
However, as for skeptics that attract a parallelism in Orwell, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in the original objective of Google founders, which said: “Let’s put all the information in the world into the system.”
According to the said Google Manager, after ten years of world-wide work, the company takes only the beginning of the process of managing all the information.
In five years’ time, Schmidt replied: “If Google could answer questions like “what to do tomorrow,” or “what work to do to me,” the software would not be able to answer such simple questions, because they do not know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that search warrants are precisely recorded in Internet searches, which IP addresses they have been searched for and which pages the interested parties have left after the search.
The Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can store their own surfing backgrounds, see what they were looking for, what they were looking for, and thus generate far more personalized hits for them in the long run - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations, which will offer us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at me, what do I do? – they ask users who are worried about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom of liberty, and possibly a rebellion against power in internet users triggers counter-reactions.
However, the confirmed fact that not only all the requested terms are recorded, but, where appropriate, they may be transferred to a third party, in such legal cases, there is no protection of the personal rights of internet users.
This was perhaps the most pronounced example of recent times of a concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian Government with information on pedophiles that enables identification from the Community side of Orkut maintained by it.
In May, however, Internet users who were concerned about personal rights could have been in a position when the company successfully proved to be right in court with EFF’s electronic law enforcement organization against the FBI: Google cannot later be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At one time, the federal government has successfully fought some 500,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which have been awarded to strengthen the child protection law that had been adopted over the years, but it has not managed to get the search lists of individual users and obtain a full website and keyword list for two months.)
Therefore, Google’s judgment is surprisingly contradictory: those who keep personal data from giving it, because they feel, intimate spheres and their private lives are starting to use Google’s services and are facing a rebellion in a conservative imiji.
Meanwhile, the U.S. genetic culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users are the next generation of big companies, the “responsible corporations” sees them, unlike rivals, with Microsoft as a world conqueror for Windows, as much as they can fight both for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request a code of identification from its users in a way other than Microsoft, does not request money for applications, the open, free, continuously updated source code and program package will be much more accessible, younger, and will have a more coolant effect on official software giant practices.
However, it may also be because the genes are able to accurately see the problem of personality rights and the Internet, which is one of the most frequently spoken keywords in recent years, the web has been drawn to itself.
The web 2.0 is not about co-laboration, we deliberately leave traces of ourselves and use the communication channels available to us and while these levels vary individually, the same thing is true: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xang, including other services, such as Twitter, or a list of music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendlyFed or Blip.fm, they can also lead a blog that automatically displays their latest photos on Flickr or Picasán.
While we can read a number of examples from which the girlfriend can easily find out the morning of the common friend circle, seeing the morning of the morning, that she spent the evening with her cheating friend or she can fire a company’s employee only because she describes her honest opinion on top of the blog: a certain concept of private life has been completely re-evaluated for now.
The person who lives an online life consists of what he shows himself, making it the basis behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least wants to avoid Google’s monopoly, it can do it (for example, when using Google’s search system, but at the same time not leaving a trace with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register for social sites, so that they cannot be found, Google’s online applications from the editor to the image manager and the news reader can be replaced by alternative versions that do not bind to giant server parks and that do not claim to be the best profile available to us.
Public opinion is not so secret when Google shows the protein of his teeth.
The company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($144 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services introduced at an ever-fast pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critics will also find the opposites to the restorative: for example, the upper management has completely rejected the opposition of the employees, since he doubled the fees of the corporate kindergarten, the company’s management has found it too costly for the employees to eat regularly on a daily basis, but it all breaks down in addition to the fact that Google has yet to head before the Chinese government in 2006, and according to their agreement, the company will find any invention that violates good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like a new service is not advertised in advance, only when it is already in use, but it is certain that the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine project has taken a measure that the company will soon face the Supreme Court, others from the Health system, because we can build a full health profile from ourselves with our previous subjects, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novell of popular Cory Doctorow, the Scroogled point orwellic sounds describe the future in which a person can only easily approach Google’s data.
Two young people helped the ozdi double killer in the attack.
Two young people were interviewed by the police in the case of the Ottoman double murder, and they were suspected to be assisted in eliminating the traces of the crime,” the Commissioner for Police in Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the act of crime and are now accused of crime.
The two young people, according to MTI information, are protected by two girls.
Crime can be punished by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the Ozdi double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was placed in pre-trial custody on Sunday.
Pre-planned, profit-making, crimes of murder committed by several people.
The investigation found that 23-year-old men belonged to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to balance his debt, so last Wednesday he betrayed his lender to a place in Ozdi, where he did it, and then to his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign of it is that he committed the murder with a gun on the spot.
The police investigate the circumstances of the weapons and their use by involving an expert.
Varsó Stock Exchange Offered to Buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - are offered by the Varsó value exchange to buy a hundred hundred hundred percent stock package of the value exchange in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Varsó value exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polishs, despite the fact that the Estonian stock exchange was previously excluded from the potential new owners of the Prague stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the stock exchange in Warsaw is in public hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60 percent of the papers in a few months.
The E15 Czech economic agenda is new to know that the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has so far been offered by interested parties for the stock exchange in Prague.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna value exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week, said that the Varso value exchange would be the worst new owner in the past, and that it could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the value exchange in Prague is estimated to be 5-10 billion kroons by market experts.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, around 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The main owner of the value exchange in Prague is Patria Finance’s investment bank with approximately 25% stake, followed by Ceska Soritellana Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13.5%.
From the perspective of the financial crisis European papers
The European newspapers leading to the growing international financial crisis in their Tuesday’s comments are already “second September 11th.”
The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States - accused of the Roman La Repubblica - the president has not yet been able to sort his own party behind the bill that was drawn up in the wound, aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which was mentioned by Warren Buffett’s billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, however, following the Congress vote, the risk is that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations of the history of capitalism is happening.
The threat can no longer be ignored - it shows the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can still give rescue belts to the muzzling financial institutions, and they can be saved from bankruptcy by taxpayers.
However, if even more banks collapse like dominos, then neither funds nor any other implants will be sufficient.
In the long run, Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national self-esteem and centralise control over the fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than €100 billion were received by vulnerable financial institutions - reminds the Berchi Der Standard that the concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, need to go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not been seriously dealing with the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is sweeping through the old continent.
“The rescuers don’t have to put hundreds of billion euros in place, but it would be good to record: in which case it is reasonable to extend the taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
The Dongo Flying of the Intelligent Car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision if it is not the imitation of obstacles in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the doping bees gave a strategic thought to Nissan engineers in order to build the next generation of collision prevention systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a BR23C-type bio-returning robotic control system, a robotized mini-car, which was supplied with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, every bees develop their own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety guard, explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, CEO of the technology PR and research development brand.
It is important to play a role in the complex eye of the uterus, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees in each direction.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers reached the idea of laser telescopes.
Before BR23C, it detects obstacles within a distance of 2 meters, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision prevention operation.
During the fraction of the second, it happens to detect the obstacle, and then the car robot, following the movements of the uterus, immediately changes the direction of the wheels by turning the necessary to avoid collision.
In any way contrary to the current system, this avoidable maneuver is carried out in a completely stimulating way.
“If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Andoh Toshiyuki, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Car Robot Project.
In an inspiring and immediate response, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety shields, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to get rid of other bees.
This process must be in a glance.
However, unlike bees, the difference cannot be directed upwards, downward or transgenderly, only two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the conversion of wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite opportunity available to remove other bees, bees were only used as a rotating movement and acceleration and slowing as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are easier and higher in their energy density, which means that their life span is longer than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says that an incentive intelligent reaction is an important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This structure should only process and respond to a few inward signs per second.
There is no need to keep them and respond with intuitive logic based on past manpower data, so it uses only a few dozen kilometer memory.
There is no need for a gigabyt, or just a set of large memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate removal, which, according to Nissan’s estimate, can be involved in the production of a series of cars within ten years.
An additional application can be used to connect the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to avoid obstacles on the road to the specified end.
The name is also for the child with poison.
The written version has been completed for the $700 billion economic rescue package for the purchase of poor bank loans in several details.
They spend half the money in the first round.
According to the Eastern Coast Time, during the next Saturday night after midnight, Congressional leaders have reached a décor in a total of $700 billion rescue packages in a debate that has been going on for days,\" Reuters said.
We have made a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. Parliamentary House, who said he had only left the agreement on paper.
The compromise was also supported by both presidents, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, said that the programme will work and be effective, but it is also necessary for further work. Pelosi says it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economic wheel.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday night 8 (i.e. Monday morning in Central Europe) but did not cause a spectacular attack on the stock market.
The draft law on the draft economic emergency legislation for 2008 on the programme is the first vote of the House of Representatives on Monday and will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the news about the deal was welcomed in the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
By the way, the program is different from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent on purchasing low-quality credit-back securities.
It is now possible to spend up to half of the $700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, and this is where the Ministry of Finance buys back-up securities with a bad rating of $100 billion, and the fate of the President depends on the decision of the President.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on the new decision of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactics: you can buy bad loans, mortgage and mortgage securities, or other types of ‘toxic’ loans at the same time.
The purchase may take place in the framework of auctions and directly, they have informed the authorities of the Ministry.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay the appropriate fees for the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said: “The law provides the necessary tools to make up to $700 billion for the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, or for the wide acquisition of bad assets, whether they are insurance or the avoidance of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.”
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it, he added.
However, bank chiefs in trouble and waiting for state assistance may expect the government to limit their exit money - which is called a gold umbrella by the overseas Slang.
The restriction of payments is limited only in certain cases, and the restrictions depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if you buy the Ministry in auction, an extra charge will be imposed on the gold drop-off screen unless you are sent to retirement for the distributed bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will be aggressively involved in ensuring that the management money is not over-exempted.
The image includes that the existing gold hanger contracts do not change, the limitation applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by the chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win in the transaction, as the economy and the saved bank stand.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the U.S. citizens have requested, that is, it does not protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Darrell Issa Republican in California.
My colleague, Mary Kaptur, in Ohio, said that the measures were the same as the ones responsible for the crash of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
In August 2008, the domestic sales prices of the industry rose by 0.1% compared to the previous month, compared to August 2007 by 12.9%, according to KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1% higher compared to July 2008, with a decrease of 3.9% compared to one year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producers’ prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, compared to 3.2% in the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum compared to the previous month, by 0.1%.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
In August 2008, the largest price increase occurred in the leather product, foot manufacturing sector (4.8 percent), mainly due to the increase in the price of the bags, sands and foot production by 4.6 percent, and to a 2.5 percent increase in the monthly price.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in significant monthly increases in the prices of the chemical, production of the product (1.6%).
The price reduction occurred in oil processing (1.4%), the production of electrical machinery, equipment (0.9 percent) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 percent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing, printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 0.2% to 0.9%.
In August, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, mainly as a result of the over-exploitation of the official gas price.
In the twelve monthly comparisons, in terms of domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors, prices in the oil processing sector increased to the greatest extent (32.4%).
The production of metal processing products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, with a 11 per cent increase in food, beverage, tobacco production.
The decrease in prices was in the manufacturing of textiles, textile products (2.5 per cent), and the production of electrical machinery, equipment (0.3 per cent).

In the manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 6,8 %, with a price reduction of 1.4% for investment goods.
The export sales prices in the industry forint in August increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, with a reduction of 3.9 per cent in 12 monthly comparisons.
Our domestic currency was reduced by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro in a month, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 per cent, compared to the dollar, and increased by 15.9 per cent.
Don't you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance of entering into the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement on January 12 – the Foreign Minister spoke of it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, “Everything depends on whether the electronic entry or control system is being built overseas in time.”
At the same time, he called attention to the fact that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian diplomat is currently negotiating in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Condoleezza Rice, who will pass the Central Cross of the Hungarian Medal of the Hungarian Republic with the Secretary-General of the Csillaggal and meetings with Barack Obama's Democratic Party and John McCain's Republican presidential advisors.
Barack Obama and McCain are next to the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the president of both the two major U.S. parties, provided the government’s $700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Following the talks of the Congress and the representatives of the administration, the marathon was announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the banking package.
The financial package for the Wall Street crisis and the capture of the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that they are more suitable for their rivals to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, by avoiding economic issues, Obama once again took some advantage of the advantage of McCain, which he gained after the Republican convention, with the nomination of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit, Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package law would quickly be passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer protection passports that he also supported.
“We need to act with responsibility (...) your job, savings, industry as a whole, the stability of the economy as a whole is at risk,” he said in front of the 35 thousand people.
He didn't forget to call McCain's economic ideas a long time ago.
McCain said in an interview to the ABC, “We are all going to find it hard to swallow (...) but nothing is simply a way to go.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the setting up of the Finance Minister’s Supervisory Committee and the limitation of the execution of the top executives, he insisted on them.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
The German Language Area 's
The left-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp became more self-conscious to the elect - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the revolutionary of Bavaria, analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU’s erosion began well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades, and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The era shift is the whole Christian democracy, so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely to be over ten years ago: an undisputed hegemony of a state party.
It has been ten years since 1998, CSU has landed at 47.7%, for the first time since the 1950s under the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was still in the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistently implemented modernization by CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in the pace they were wrong. However, there could not have been consequences for the CSU loyalty of the electors in the developing regions of secularization, educational results, the integration of East and North Germans into Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are also visible.
The left-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp became more self-conscious, critical, self-centered.
It is also obvious that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups were most distant from the CSU; free professionals, industrialists, graduates and seniors.
The support of the CSU has been under 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The article “Who, who? Party presidents deal with the disrupted coalition issues,” deals with the disruptive internal political situation that occurred after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders hardly allowed an insight into their cards.
Werner Faymann SPÖ said he wanted to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in certain provinces and in the social partnership.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Moltererre, the current President of the ÖVP, as well as the co-author, can imagine, was opened by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was set anyway.
Repeating this direction is not going to happen.
Molterer responded carefully to the red bids.
As he said, it will certainly not be effective to cooperate if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To choose the opposition, or to enter the coalition, it is open to the party for the time being, the issues must be discussed within the CSD.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly opened up in every direction.
“By preventing the red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility,” said Haider.
Járókoda: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities was launched by France, which is the host of the European Union presidency this year.
Járóka Lília, a well-founded representative of the European People's Party in a message to the education segment in one of the main speakers of the professional consultation, called for this to be one of the most serious obstacles to violations and enforcement of Roma children.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Mr Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most significant European legal and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities were invited to the conference.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP representative group, he warned that, in addition to the discrimination experienced at work, the Roma are primarily deprived of the labour market through their low education.
“The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education, and as a result of poor-quality basic education, they can only acquire a significant share of higher education.”
He also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the representative, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the widest range - between Roma and non-Romans.
At the same time, Roma students start school early, they increase their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
“The Roma must have the right to quality education on the right of their European citizenship and ensure that their low-quality and differentiated education is eliminated,” Líria said.
According to the representative, the objective and action-oriented coordination of the European Union is essential for the immediate acceleration of school degeneration processes, the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination dividends is essential.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-fledged citizen,” Járóka said.
In the light of the European Year for Gender Equality for all, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the fall of the election, the heads have not yet fallen, and at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the discussion of personal issues has been ongoing.
Erwin Huber and Günther Beckstein’s head of government remain in place, a question of how long the grace takes.
At the last weekend of October on the fate of a 17 percent disaster, a huge party will decide.
The members of the couple who held a lot were at all perceived: they don’t stick to their chairs with all their strength.
They tried to disintegrate the fact that the group and the base were angry, who, one day after the \"bajor tsunami\", demanded personal consistency because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of his career, the Christian social union earned 60.7%, now on the other hand, one year after the strike against Stoiber, he ran only 43.4% of their power.
For 46 years, the CSU was a “one-quarter ruler” in Bavaria, with 18% of German GDP.
At the same time, conservatives continue to expect a high level of value for the Hungarian economy in the key southern region, and in the future they will certainly be forced into coalitions.
As one of the first signs of the restructuring within the party, the Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is the potential successor of Huber, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, will also have a seat in the narrow investigation team, which will start a relaxing debate with the Liberal FDP and the Free Electors who organises the right-wing values.
The strange finalor of fate is that on the list of Free Elections, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken by Huber-Beckstein as a pair of buffers, and then unsatisfiedly treated with the great local politician.
CSU leaders now turn all their energies around to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, he will have an active role to play with the strands from the background, Stoiber, former head of government and former president of CSU, appointed the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a number of comments to the CDU, he said they deserved much more support from the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be considered a Chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in national success in 2005, is not somehow claimed to be a common force.
According to Merkel, the decline in CSU’s soil will not negatively affect Berlin’s grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to handle, and the social democratic crisis will continue.
SPD has achieved the weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 by 18.6 percent.
Lukastenko: 110-0
No opposition representative entered the White House following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the inconsistency and stability provided by Aleksandr Lukasenko in the country, however, by the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (CESA) of the European Union.
The EBEZ, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of hundreds of tens of thousands of countries has been without opposition for the next decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, known as the Democratic Forces (ODS), was seriously hoping that, following the amendment of the Constitution, the presidential mandate of the 2006 contested clean elections would be renewed for a quarter of this time by Lukasenko, which allowed the appearance of some opposition representatives in Parliament.
The DOSZ has thus stopped from the pre-exploited boy.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was said that Belarus, which was economically increasingly dependent on Russia, had borrowed a loan for the reduction of the ever-depleting Russian gas imports, and contributed to the delivery of gas pipelines in the country, was also intended to improve its relationship with the EU, where, due to the anti-democratic political arrangement of Belarus, Lukasenko and several high-ranking politicians were not allowed to enter.
The EESC pointed out that, when assessing the electoral campaign, it was more likely that the EBEZ would focus on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, for example, to prevent opposition candidates from leaving the third.
However, the EBEZ's Monday's rapid report has already challenged the campaign - during which opposition candidates could not have actually appeared in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the vote.
At the same time, however, the opposition has seen a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for a smaller confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two territories independent for a month.
“We took two steps forward, one back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” said Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, it is desirable that this remain despite the fact that “the power was afraid of allowing even one of its opposition to the incessant parliament.”
The opposition does not plan protesting actions, seeing the results, rather trying to send a message of the need for economic reforms to the electors.
“We have a lot of problems, of course, we need to print opposition papers in Russia, and the local authorities are making obstacles to presenting, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that Lukasenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security as the main result, even the layer of the most officially supported pensioners, is not correct.
- Due to the country's debt, the increase in commercial deficit, it is time to ask the \"sleeping silence\", said Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers recognized elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebégyev, who is the head of the mission of the Union of the Independent States, told the Russian news agency Riga Novostyi: “Not the words, but the actions are believed by men,” so the absence of opposition is evidence of maturity of white elect.
Brunetta: \"Reggeli only before working time\"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, the rotating doors were fitted in a unique way to get workers out and enter.
From today on, this new measure will apply to those who are concerned, to filter out those who block, and then to go get a coffee at work.
He presented the anti-clockwise novel today to Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Secretary General Mauro Masi of the Prime Minister's Office.
“The turning gate,” said Brunetta, serves better and more effective work, reducing gaps and increasing services.
\"There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform,” said Brunetta.
Chigi Palota will complete all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, the installation of the rotating cabinets is also important from a symbolic point of view.
On behalf of the employees we have not experienced resistance, the Secretary-General confirmed: “Workers have approved the measure, everyone has cooperated.
The breakfast is over at work, there is no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta, smiling, advises: “A good little capuccino at seven o’clock in the morning, capable of miracles.”
the Roman Public School
In a discussion, the minister said: “In three months, 50% of people in the public sector fell due to illness, which means more than 600,000 workers in a year.”
He added, however, that Italian administration should be made more effective.
, whose wage dynamics, according to the Minister, were twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and he also exceeded the inflation rate.
At the same time, thousands of people gathered together, joining the application supported by the Italian Environmental and Consumer Protection Organisations Organisations to object to the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
“As the Minister of Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of disease deficits, the 'unfortunate sunblocks' war is constantly increasing,\" the consumer defense association said.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff gathered together to send out war to the illegal regulations of the regulation.
The regional administrative court shall, inter alia, attack the abolition of additional nutrients for the disease which may be returned to the grounds of service, the extension of the period of residence of workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else.
In Italy, there are 2,500 workplace accidents every day, of which 3 deaths and 27 end with persistent disability.
According to workplace accident insurance data, nearly 1.200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and require almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmi organizes the 58th time in all the counties of Italy, the day of occupational accidents on the second Sunday of October to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
“The worrying data reported by Anmi, as well as the tragic events of recent days, are also based on the fact that prevention in workplace accidents has a prominent role to play,” said President Pietro Mercandelli of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the National Association of the Baltics of the Baltics.
The Head of State sincerely appreciated the commitment of the Association to the prevention of work, the interests of workers affected by the accident, the assistance of the family members of the victims and the capture of public opinion.
“The natural and all-natural, and the truth-difficultly divided in such a way, by its size, are the tragedy of media and public interest, but in reality we must face dramatic, repeated cases of reality every day, again and again.
Napolitano publicly admits: “We are struggling with a lack of resources, funding education and information is crucial.
In particular, initiatives within the school aimed at directly enlightening young people who enter the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to let attention be drawn to the social importance of the issue, as well as to more effective legislation that needs to be implemented.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Lower House, stressed on his part: “What a serious, social significance for all of us, and institutions, as a matter of urgency, are required to put an end to this.”
“The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still extremely high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, President Anmi.
“We don’t want this declining trend to be divided, because the greatest tragedy occurs when the attention is reduced.
“We believe that we are still not doing everything at the general level to overcome the phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more strict supervision and control would be needed - he stressed Mercandelli - and he stressed the need to intervene more closely in the field of labour education, starting with school education -
“We need further efforts to inform and capture the public,” he said.
What is most necessary, however, is a more responsible employer environment for a phenomenon that poses a social problem.
After that, Mercandelli criticized the gradual deterioration of the compensation network for victims of occupational accidents, and the \"aid direction towards which the system is running in recent years\".
“The aim is therefore to give workers back the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of the victims cannot depend on the legislators where they are selfish and where they are divided.”
Hearing damage to MP3 players
It can cause hearing loss of portable player devices for longer and high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee for New and New Identifyed Health Risks (SCENIHR), published today, on the basis of a public opinion.
“It is clear from the expert opinion that people who have a hearing loss of 5-10 percent per day for more than an hour for five years will listen to their portable music player with high volume,” the explanation explains.
“It’s worrying that young people who use high-strength music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can unreturnedly damage their hearing,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific surveys show an indisputable risk, which we must respond urgently,” the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we must also review the existing control systems in order to be able to operate and keep pace with the latest technologies.
Brussels called on the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they caused.
\"The researchers confirm that we have concerns, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to protect children and young people who are exposed to portable gambling and similar instruments,\" the Committee said.
The current European Safety Regulation sets maximum noise levels for portable music players in 100 dB, while increasing concern is accompanied by data on hearing loss resulting from excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise noise, which can significantly reduce those hearing damage.
The EU Scientific Committee explains in its opinion that those using portable player devices who listen to music with high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week exceed the maximum current value of noise in the workplace.
If you listen to music for a longer time, there is a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of the users of the portable device, which can also represent 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno, will set up the Committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today, it will start until March, the results will be expected in June.
This schedule was set up by the Metropolitan Government for the future of the “Roma capital capital” committee, which was assembled this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caverella bath.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will draw up the Rome guidelines.
Following the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the municipal committee in order to be able to submit an officially approved capital strategic plan by the Government and Gianni Alemanno Mayor in June.
\"This is a fully independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - stressed Alemanno - to develop proposals for the development ideas of Rome, which can be based on political decision makers, the General Assembly and the Government Committee.
There is no conflict of competence, we just wanted a platform where great plans for Rome can be born.
In March, after his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed term mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee called \"The Future of the Central Town of Rome\", the Prime Minister said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the expert opinion it has made does not have a binding force, Alemanno responds: “All depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it proposes on the table.
If the standard proves appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I am sure of in Rome, it will play an important role in its contribution.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the day-to-day affairs and in the management of urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we are looking beyond the perspective and planning for a longer term, and we are committed to the development and future of Rome.
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that “the Commission is not considered to be a useless “waterhead” because it is completely free of charge, it will not go into any euro of the citizens of Rome, it serves as a reflection and aims to involve the city’s most outstanding minds.”
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to jump to the level that it needs so much, thinking about its future in a united spirit.”
About the future in which the mayor of Rome stresses: “Not only will the current municipal framework be limited, but it will look far further, not only at the future metropolis and the capital city status, but also at the role that it can play as the capital city of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region, and which it will also need to fill.”
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, who claims to be independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
He was the first Jimmy Carter to make decisions to ruin the American economy and maintain close relationships (as a private person today) with the enemy Islam.
As the election time approaches, the attacks against Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
Obama believes that he can win the highest public rights dignity of a nation, which has so far had two governors and five senators in black.
These attacks are actually unspeakable; of course, racist, but they do not answer the question of whether the voters will be a good president. Then there are public polls: they indicate that Obama will win, even more significant.
In this case, there is also a person who listens to his emotions and doesn’t mind.
In the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its leadership: we know that in the polls, the real U.S. nationalist casts his vote.
A side of the American mindset is shown here that remains hidden until the last moment.
“Just talk about what you want, and then we know where to put the twins, Obama, or McCain.
Some swear that if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
There have never been such words until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this intelligence, the Democrat's winning weapon is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked about the mistakes they made during Bush’s term of office? 89% replied to Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they landed on the ground that he flew to the country.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak point in Bush.
It's a huge task for George W.
The U.S.: The economic collapse has already been felt by journalists, the time has come in the editors. Many people blame the Internet for the “death” of the printed press.
The Pew Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist's pessimistic about his own future.
However, it was not clearly claimed that their concern for authenticity would have been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem of American journalists is money.
We believe the 2008 crisis is a bankruptcy of a powerful economic model.
Another serious problem is the newsroom, i.e. the cuts to the editors making the newspaper.
If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense of what the great public understands, to be minimized, we need to solve this problem,” the journalists asked.
Today, well-seen and complex pessimism characterizes American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the press are convinced that national zurnalistics are on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in a senior position.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press staff to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are trying to get themselves to the Internet, many of which are believed to be the “murder” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” of journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 surveyed journalists admitted that they would put a voksa down next to the technology, hoping that it might be for the benefit of zurnalistics.
Today, in the U.S. press, there is a gap between the editors, the directors, and the reporters working for them.
At national level, 56% of executives are sure to share their information with others, while at local level this rate is only 23%.
Some people link this to a certain place of work.
At national level, 47% of managers are afraid to lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30%.
In the United States, the question of “confirmed work” is constantly on the agenda at the team level (for our editors, etc.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a vast nation such as the United States of America with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers work, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so that it works on the basis of “bell or not.”
The directors usually receive a high salary, and the editors can earn $100,000 a month in addition to their pension and health insurance fees.
Freedom, however, is a rather complicated principle: in the first year, the day x, in the third, as long as it does not reach the maximum 15 days after a certain time.
But American journalists, according to their own statement, often “be sick over the year”
Everything is a climate function.
UNIPOL: REGIONS WITH DANilO COPPOLA GROTAFERRABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, refused the request of Danilo Coppola, who wanted to travel from his residence from Grotaferrata to a Roman apartment.
The investigation against Coppola is being conducted on the basis of economic bankruptcy, in the context of an investigation in the case of an agreement on the exchange of shares between Unipol - BNL.
Last week, during the procedure against him, the house arrest was dissolved and changed to a residence ban for Grotaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, were asked to go through the real estate to the capital apartment of the small town.
However, according to the Court, these influxs (which the prosecutor has proposed) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence it has brought against them.
The Elite at Risk
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package submitted by the White House: most of the Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs that the current crisis has resulted in a break in the Republican Party, which shows an ever greater division between the traditional, restrained, federal institutions and business circles of the eastern coast and the new anti-Warning, Washington and financial world line in the Central and Southern states.
This direction appeared critically in the House of Representatives’ vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still going on has to be predicted or seen, and not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, and perhaps even outside it.
It seems that the crisis, in the USA and in Europe, has only accelerated the already flat-screen phenomena that are becoming more stable in this new atmosphere and finally come to light.
The first such phenomenon is the return of a dual category of re-actualization, of state sovereignty to public consciousness, of a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking institutions that also maintain close links with foreign countries, but above all, and quite widely, with people and families living in a single country.
This, however, represents a direct political difficulty for those in the government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who, by the way, electors.
Thus, the crisis seems to be global in the same economic sense, but in a political sense almost exclusively national.
It seems that political interdisciplinaryism is essentially outside the coastline: it is a genuine proof of this by the European Union, which, inter alia, is not able to define a uniform political direction between different interests and national strategies.
So everyone is waiting for intervention from each national government, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but most importantly, the opening of funds: as only the individual states have economic resources in need, with a financial stock that can be able to fix things.
They also have the means and the mandate to use them: in the case of such circumstances, there are two invaluable sources that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation to such extent.
In other words, the new emphasis placed on the nation state by the crisis is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is an increasingly important factor that is closely linked to this principle: this is the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the world of more sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we had to realize that our future is increasingly dependent on things that were not lost, such as water, crop and oil.
From things that can be delivered from one side of the planet to another, however, they can be fully connected to a circumcised place.
So then whoever controls the area has a lot more bats than those born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also turn to the second novelty, a kind of fracture cell.
Anyone who says that the area, the state, the government, is necessarily saying: politics, leadership in other words.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two clashing phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective of recognizing that there is a need for credible leadership, for those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the complete loss of credit for economic leaders, who proved to be completely inappropriate and proved that many areas were still in front of them.
The two together have even deeper significance and, in a sense, more dissatisfaction: the feeling of loss of credit, impatientness, incompetence and isolation, affecting the entire elite in more and more Western countries.
Thus, it seems that the population is becoming increasingly widespread, that the time of social elite up to this point has expired, even before their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their culture, their culture, their word complex, they would have made it themselves. By doing so, the social elite is becoming increasingly immersed from the opinion of the majority.
At the same time, the need for leadership, in the form of a shattered, but strong delegitimation movement, is fed against the ruling divide and the traditional political system. This is not expected of voters in their “sacrifices” or, in recent times, manifests itself in sudden changes in the public voice. For example, the acquisition of conservatives into power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the working party unit in Great Britain, or the rebellion of U.S. Congressarians against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side can be sorted here).
It seems that traditional elites, parties, programs, and even say that with their habits, press and famous intellectuals at university, they are getting less and less able to represent what is happening in the deeper layers of Western society for some time. Moreover, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spread and potentially able to create more and more and more scaled start-ups.
Despite all this, “the rebellion of the masses on the threshold,” speaking frankly, it would be excessive.
But to walk with an open eye is nothing to do with it.
We can go with a superpower adhesive on the wall
With the help of a super powerful glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall as Spider-Man.
This goal was set up by several U.S. research centres, and a group created by four institutions is close to the solution.
With just 2.5 square centimetres of glue, the researchers managed to attach and maintain a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
The U.S. journal, The Science, published the discovery of some of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team has already been developed by the development of specific, so-called carbon nanotubes.
“We need to imagine the glued operating principle as a package of pipes similar to the specatti,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a research researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Atlantic.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot covered with gecko microscopic cracks, which provides a perfect grip to the animal.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon, and plaster paper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the tops of the said seals, while it is easily removed from the wall, explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty at the University of Dayton.
“This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Can we go on the wall, just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers prefer to think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes drive the heat and electric power well.
You can find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can wait.
The University of Berkeley in California is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to the article published in the American Chemical Society in c., California scientists presented a adhesive made of hair fiber microfibre material that goes through self-cleaning during the movement on the surface, so it always provides a perfect grip.
It's forbidden with a fruit juice.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and almala.
These high-vitamin drinking drinks, especially in summer, if taken together with certain life-saving drugs, change their absorption, as they may be strengthened or reduced depending on the case. This can also result in serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario of London, called attention to the risks of the combined use of candid or fresh fruit juices and certain drugs. The professor announced that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs in Philadelphia at a national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, preventing their beneficial effect and putting the patient’s health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was previously placed on the accused bench when it was found that it was able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety, heart rhythm control and nerve tissue to toxic levels.
COCKATES - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Medicine published the news in its official public domain, and also warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with these co-administrations and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that prevent the absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of the Department of Medicine at the State University of Milan, says: “This kind of discovery is generally immediately indicated to various national and international pharmacies who, if necessary, ensure that the information contained in the particular drug is changed.
Therefore, we should always read the information of the intended medicine and, if something is not understandable, let us not influence ourselves, but let us ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly,” he said.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics, Analysis of the territorial relations between commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman, teaches Princeton University, and is a well-known publicist of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the worst judges in the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush Government.
After the terrorist attack in September 2001, a few months after Enron went bankrupt, Krugman announced that the last event would have more devastating consequences than the collapse of twin towers from the history of the United States.
This forecast has led to little debate, and in many ways it has been placed in the eyes of economists, but we now know that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised, and I’m a little shocked at the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smamphi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a \"rompously valuable economist\", while spreading his criticisms against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government in a rather \"aggressive style\".
Open Office, third edition of the “Microsoft Anti-Pack” package
Today, the Open Program Pack, which increases personal productivity by OpenOffice.org 3.0, aims to target wider layers of Microsoft Office as a free alternative, from home to office users, from freelancers to public administration.
Following work by SUN Microsystem and voluntary developers for almost a year, the new Open Office takes over to the public with several novelties: outside the welcoming screen and the re-thinking, less spontaneous user interface, offers several important innovations. For example, Apple Mac OS X compatibility and supports the new ISO standard OFF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
The Office 2007 system has been given special attention, so Open Office can also open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to add a few more specific features of the module, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files to a graphics module, maintaining a site layout.
We can also create PDF documents on this interface that combines typical Adobe format with table manager or text editor elements.
The sharing within applications has also been through a number of developments: the table manager supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents the rewriting of each other's work. Each employee's comment is marked with different colors, which helps to identify more easily at the control stage.
Some companies have already been working to get some of the functions of OpenOffice from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after you have been posted to the mirror sites in English since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The program pack is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can take the installation CD at our home or at work.
In terms of the spread of the home application, freedom is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick it in the business sector, as it can also count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, text editor for Word; Calc, table manager for the replacement of Excel; Impression, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphic module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that we are already at 3.600,000 with the emergence of the new version, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of Tour de France, a positive sample was produced again by one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colors of the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best mountain trico in addition to my bronze.
The news has seen the sun on the Equipe website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Ricccě and Leonardo Piepol, and the German, Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who had a positive result in Cera testing as the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests performed in the last few weeks, was studied by the laboratories in thelausanne-i andchatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, Austria will lose its third position and, according to the regulations, will be banned from competition for two years.
The report on the positive outcome of Kohl's third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the Head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told Associated Press news agency: he signaled the positive doppinger results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians were able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and win the best mountain trip.
BENEFITS: THE NEW YORK TIMES OF THE FUTURE, THE RICH OF THE WORD?
Italy’s country of emigration has only recently changed to one of the popular destinations of migrants accepted by the reluctantly.
This is why the New York Times is turning into a \"Belpaese\" racist nation, which is a question of the young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits - is a long article devoted to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what is called the paradox of New York Times: in the northern regions, “the most powerful is integration and the highest is employment, but also “the support of immigration and the North League” is also the most powerful in the country.
To support the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would strengthen the lawn on immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have been introduced as an example of mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano XVI. Benede met in the Quirinale Palace and said that the state and the Church would work together to overcome racism.”
Students may suffer from expensive rental fees, up to 900 euros in a room
The market for accommodation issued by universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has already taken on an amazing scale, which, due to the total cost of families, closes the broad layers of students from the possibility of learning,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. “In these cities, the high demand for students distorted the market to such a degree that a general process of fertilization has been launched against local residents.
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: non-registered, non-registered contracts, non-restricted leases.
According to Sunia, it would be necessary to take an extraordinary measure which, through a review of the tax system, creates an opportunity to maximize prices.
The survey shows that in Milan, Brianza, there are 450 euros for a bed; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (area of Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros (Lariate, Udine and Fiera), but you can reach 900 euros (area of Vittoria).
In Florence, the average bed is 350/400 euros, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where the students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a beds cost 250/280 euros if it is double and 370-500 euros when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, around 600 euros are requested in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) for a single and 450 bed in a double room.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€550 per person room) in the vicinity of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
In the suburban districts, you can save 300 euros in a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples they ask for 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The highest price is around Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay EUR 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute value, but they represent a greater weight within the city’s budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are often looking for accommodation, another disorder can be observed: the rental fee requested from foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the old cinema halls have been sacrificed in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closed in the interest of multiplexes.
“A city where there is no moss, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.
The images made by the director of Giuseppe Tornatore show all that goes well in the Italian capitals, but also in rural regions.
Reducing the cinema - the appearance of large multi-thermal cinemas in the suburbs, and then the separation of one-thermordials in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
“It’s like a friend goes away, a familiar with whom we shared our journey and many experiences,” says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was twenty years ago for Oscar’s award, and the Grand Prize for Cannes Festival, tells the story of a small town cinema, the cravings, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clearly spoken: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas closed. The biggest loss was recorded in the cinemas in the major cities: 10 film theaters closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-term cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that, for their disappearance, the colonization of the multiplexes is no better than the highest number of newly opened multi-term cinemas in the three regions of Italy: the number of rooms increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and equally in Emilia-Romagna.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, President of Anec. “It is well that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city theater is closed, not all of them are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial funds for the support of operators: the State’s debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
In ethical and moral terms, it is also shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market, €16-18 million a year would be needed.
This is the first Italian city that, in its concerns over closures, decided to address the problem by an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost a single-storey cinema in the area and the city centre.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and the benefits of the public to facilitate access: viewers can park in restricted zones and in certain parking spaces with a reduced tariff.
“This initiative is being carried out,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow Bologna’s example.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight with the rule of multiplexs, must improve sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that ultimately made Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I lived in Rome 25 years ago, so when I went to the closed Rialto or Quirinale to see the stained plaques of dust, I would rather turn my head away.
Strong strands between politics and 'ndrangheta' were arrested by Mayor Gioia Tauro
“The Mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decision-making.”
There have been grave accusations against the judges of the Anti-Calabriian Executive Board, Mayor of Gioia Tauro and Deputy Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external participation in a criminal cooperative.
Bilincchino Piro Model, a senior broker between the clan and the public administration, and a lawyer nephew named the boss, who has previously been convicted of participation in a mafia-like crime association, and has imposed a compensation of EUR 10 million.
“Delivering the legal and moral rules of mine, more of what is good for its taste,” the state prosecutors said. The two local authorities expressed their intention to pay an advisory fee for the Piromodel lawyer.
“This would have been the official entrance of the clan to the city hall, which would have given us further opportunity to control and control public administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not conceal that there is a number of concerts between local institutions and the organized sub-world: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where it is not inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta,' they are heroes who remain clean.
Today's morning arrests are the continuations of the July events, when the police announced they were able to finish the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were expelled from their government administration mandate. Gioia Tauro’s municipal committee was once disbanded in 1991, even because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of Christian democrat at the time of the division, was in the second round of 2006 to the head of the right-hand coalition.
Botrát cried out when the County House ordered the municipal committee to disband.
It was brought before the Court by former Interior Minister Marco Mininit and accused him of planning everything with political purpose. However, the court explained in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromodel clan had dared to require the change of the A3 project.
According to the hearings ordered against Dal Torriona, the state prosecutors wrote: “It was necessary to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who were well-known to the Pyromodel family, to subsidize the decisions of the municipality to the clans.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70% of the surface of the planet and which is only now discovered by large international energy companies
Hulls, sea currents, currents, and renewable sources of energy that have been eyed by giants like Chevron, who are trying to put their hands on.
They've been looking for a hundred years to get energy from the sea's movements. In the '70s, research has increased during the first oil crisis.
Around 1980, when oil prices were reduced, the idea of exploitation of marine energy was reversed, but today the need for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices is a new momentum for the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimates that 15 percent of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by offshore wave facilities.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would be currents and currents.
The giants are down.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It has been two years since, and more and more companies have been taking a bow to marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
“Chevron studies the technologies that utilize the energy of the oceans and considers the possibility of cooperation with us,” said a spokesman for an American oil giant, Wall Street Journal’s economic newspaper.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the authorisation necessary for the launch of the Alaskan project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the U.S. Energy Committee.
This is not a small matter, especially if we consider the US to continue oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. and Ocean Power in New Jersey also walks the way of energy coming out of the sea. The amounts invested so far, as you can know about the details, are proving a growing interest.
Technology is expected to be developed.
According to experts, it is still a matter of initial technology, even because the energy obtained from the sea does not disperse doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities like Portugal or Scotland are both small and therefore do not cause too much problems with ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy in greater scales, it is necessary to have facilities that have a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses, for example, a interconnected bonus system.
The waves and the shocks moving the bonuses are transformed into hydraulic pressure by the plugs and cylinders placed inside them.
The pressure is turning a turbine, and it feeds a generator.
The power of electricity comes from cables under the sea to land.
At the same time, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are already waiting for a federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
On the other hand, Verdant Power has already launched energy production for a shopping mall and a parking lot using the six submarine turbines located in East River in New York.
