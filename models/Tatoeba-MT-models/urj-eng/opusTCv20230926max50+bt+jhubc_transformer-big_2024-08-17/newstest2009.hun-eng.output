The Prague Stock Exchange is at a disadvantage at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions with shares in the Czech Energy Industry Company (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) reached nearly half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its Monday fall from the beginning of Tuesday’s trading, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which has refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Shares in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, although some of the losses were eventually eliminated during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index accounted for almost four percent of the trade, but later it cancelled some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent in the Hong Kong stock exchange and closed markets in Shanghai.
The stock on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
“The timing of the US rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although a part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the central bank of China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should resume negotiations immediately and accept the financial system’s support proposal.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also be aware of the consequences.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would have cost $700 billion (almost $12 trillion).
The lawmakers thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath, and leading stock indices recorded the largest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar fall was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal had not been accepted in the House of Representatives, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Congress chiefs and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
They will vote on this at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about $12 trillion).
But there is no victory yet.
Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before it can make public the final form of the law and their votes.
The draft financial support for the system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, he informed Reuters news agency Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Organizations Committee.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on as soon as Wednesday.
Economists say there should be a announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be a "forethought" afterwards.
Paulson: The plan should be effective
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our different views on what the form of a package for stabilising the market should be,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat at Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, on Saturday night to form a permanent government fund.
This should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgages that put financial firms in grave losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a final agreement on a draft that will work, and that should be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair proposal still needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Sign for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling violently.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said the lawmakers were trying to reach an agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian money markets, where the time zone could be the first to influence Monday’s trading.
It is not yet clear, however, when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, as well as whether the trial can be stopped at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still undergoes a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later at $350 billion if it feels that the program is not performing its function.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may override its veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire the financial means to purchase bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
With the progress made in the negotiations, President Bush was also pleased.
Tony Fratto, a spokesman for Bush, said the president was “satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated the two-party effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of Busy End Satisfactions
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the lawmakers had agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called "busy suffocations" of the directors participating in the program and establishes a fund monitoring committee.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should create new installments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of the debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
According to David Marek, senior economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“This is because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic actives will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Parallel blade: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be reached.
It seems that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-end expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl discs, you probably dream of such a disc player.
This is similar to the one intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue 8,000 crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a twenty-coron market earphone.
Two extremes, between which everyone has enough space.
There is a wide selection.
The life of the batteries also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just playing music, but also something that most mobiles don’t even accidentally do.
No device today is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, you can also play music and video, record both, have a better-badger camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a little miracle, as no refrigerator can grill and no television can take photos.
However, multi-function mobiles also have drawbacks.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more time the display sends to the charger.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, count on them not to play for you for more than a few hours.
Even if you’re on the phone here and there, get a charger for your workplace – this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod), players do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players already create their own music library based on the artist, album, genre name, or user’s evaluation.
Some devices only represent a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, you should primarily ask about battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and, of course, the convenience of the treatment.
If the music is primarily a background for you and you only listen to it for a short time every day, for example, on the tram, any mobile device that plays MP3 will suit you.
Any mobile phone can do that.
You don’t have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player knows.
With MP3, each of them will cope, and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most popular, and the vast majority of the devices also cope with WMA format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and your iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow online music shopping, for example.
It is enough to visit the respective pages of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a powerful argument for the mobile acquisition of music.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is crappy and is usually limited to one-year-old radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this type of selling of music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, your mobile is tapped out in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is lying at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the headphones or at least the hands-free ones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost all mobile, but few MP3 players.
For many, music mobiles will probably have the biggest benefit of the price.
The cheapest ones are usually less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair enough walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of conventional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns with traditional 3.5 mm diameter hole earphones.
However, the advantages of players are, among other things, simple handling.
With the simplest - certainly not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection), everyone really copes.
Minimal function, handling similar to the usual cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of a crash in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet, nor is there any risk of data transmission for the subsequent huge account.
Which device to choose
The cheapest mobile devices (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
When you buy the right card, it can cost up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The base types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irate.
Based on the capacity (up to 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the convenience of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the farthest in the industry, which has the same user interface for walkman series mobiles as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players from the above brands can offer the same service in the same price range up to 4 000 kroons, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
However, something is missing for us here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be that long.
On Mobil.cz we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
After the last step of the European Commission, roaming charges may be regulated in a contradictory situation - some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than their own.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and have a penetration that is higher than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has often agreed to this, who has previously stated several times that there is no room for new service providers in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classical service provider with its own network is unlikely to have too many chances (although it would be difficult to find a frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, which the classic service providers also had to react to.
Even before big fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile were introduced to the market in Great Britain, sounds similar to ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, we do not have to go too far for example.
In February this year, we informed you about the departure of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the Penta Financial Group, which also owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much smaller target group.
For efficient operation, you need far fewer customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world usually appear as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and sms, but they often offset it with fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages that are at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider is specifically focused on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, a virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar idea to that of Poland can work for us.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesperson for Vodafone, doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
It is also relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem too hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
This indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not overly sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition can be created.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in starting a virtual service provider for some time now, which aims to take another step to make Telefonica O2 a true competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers not only wired but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have discussed this opportunity again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
There may be better times.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
“At this moment, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider would have a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
Until now, we have not been invited by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area,” he mentioned to Mobil.cz from the Press Department of Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica 02.
Other suppliers also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesman for T-Mobile, said: "Unfortunately, we have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which to build."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network, by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear.
There should be a concrete agreement on our table right now so that we can think in such a short term.”
Vodafone prefers to focus its attention on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, primarily in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most rewarding for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is partnering to build networks shared with high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
The process of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another provider would mean increased competition, lower prices and thus lower profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When service providers have something important, they are able to work together, as evidenced by the history of the birth of the U:fon.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably around the birth of the U:fon of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument as to why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been influenced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be highly demanding."
In view of this attitude of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C><0xC3><0x9A>, which in the Czech Republic, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition.
Only the Hungarian Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a characteristic relation to the whole problem.
“The entry of a virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the supply of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers,” said Kristián Chlapua, the foreign relations department of the Hungarian Competition Authority.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one can re-establish their market position, this is more than strange.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: “In a foreign country where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile phone services.”
However, it is likely that the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS are not subject to pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the reaction of the three mobile operators is quite touching.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just like at filling stations, the same gas prices are probably just a result of coincidence and hard competition.
"In this case, the Office did not discover the signs of anti-competitive proceedings, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither service provider has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for its market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are also likely to be missing to the telecom regulator,” Chalupa said.
The presentation of market leadership is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if this argument were not accepted, it should be a minimum warning for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are acting in a strikingly similar way.
Meanwhile, complaints from interested parties (including the already mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all service providers.
And to shift responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hand off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications could not be carried through, although many experts hoped for an improvement in the situation.
This should be well known to the representatives of the UOHS, but their interests are likely to be different.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of fake virtual service providers, many of which already operate in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies that have their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
These are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the service provider as a classic corporate client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a prominent customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar advances.
"If there were cases of breach of contract terms that you are talking about, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would be dealing with and that could lead to the termination of our cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová said in a statement.
But it is quite unlikely that news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, there are thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending itself against such a procedure.
These companies do not have negligible profits and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not particularly threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their name, so they cannot have it in its entirety as the general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0xBA> should be.
In addition, another question arises for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they obstructing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong right to expose such an activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they have not suspected such a thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classic service providers tried to prevent them more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small or perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory bodies intervened at this very moment, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they reached the conclusion that the first virtual service provider was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are giving the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that inconclusive competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If a service provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS can only be difficult to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be able to make more expensive calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my country? on the Czech State Day.
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlavek.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, vocal or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions of iHNed.cz on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered one of the most beautiful anthems by the B<0xC4><0x9B>loblak.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose young, representative singers to sing the solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and later at the orchestra were clean, that the text was well understood and that it was consistent,” he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where Is My Country?" was first performed in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetan's Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously regarded it as their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state emblems.
What is the "New" Anthem
The Prague transport company will also deliver a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, you will enter the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date the first passenger enters the metros, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (valid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time they can save on their chip cards in the information centers and branches of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobyhlaly, Rajka
Coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who start using online trading can permanently forget the publishing windows of the metro stations, where they have regularly had to go through long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and saved to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these locations, passengers have access to a desk with trained servers to help those interested in online shopping and save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a project spokesman.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can also be saved to Opencard in self-service vending machines equipped in some hallways.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they are reminiscent of ticket managers and passengers may have noticed them on Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is automatically checked instead of the driver.
It’s easy to manage the automatics starting tomorrow.
It is enough to just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also around it.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the districts of Central Bohemia travel mainly to the capital.
“On trains in Prague, integrated transport, the guides were equipped with card readers to help determine the zone validity of the coupons,” explained Filip Drápal from the Prague Public Transport Agenda.
In the buses around the city, the card readers are built at the driver’s desk.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in a specific location on the side of the cashier.
The driver checks the validity of the coupons.
“For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires will be able to return to the self-service machines that save the coupons on cards.
Information about the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
Sudan wants a referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudanese Germans asked for the annexation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This is evident from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudanese Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is also apparent from a private archive preserved in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov in the letter asked the US president not to allow the re-return of the "Sumava County" to the Czech Republic, which was still taken by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“We have interpreted the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure in the words that American troops are not coming to German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People who bear the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava at their hearts.”
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give hope to the Sudanese Germans, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, only to brutality, ruthlessness, non-understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over the protectorate "now and forever" over <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of the four million inhabitants, it would judge this area as a foreign country for us, which would oppress and upset the minority and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors were not allowed to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Chumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Chumava County on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve with the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it adequately reflects the expectations of the Sudanese Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to minimally suspect that they were going to be deported from the country, only a few of them acknowledged the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudanese.
Others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and threw him into the Holshtynsk<0xC3><0xB3> prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They were confident that when they returned home, they would benefit from the Czech language,” Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war calculated that they would be expelled from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think, you pay.
Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history is road safety.
The media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday could also be characterized.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office from this campaign hopes to deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, as well as on flyers.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to lock their seat belts before they leave.
First of all, young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers want to speak to their consciences.
And what appears in the ads?
Emotionally offensive, primarily human stories.
This is also confirmed by the campaign’s “bloody” slogan:
You don't think, you pay.
The word "do not think" on the license plate is written in large letters.
And there's the word "pay" in the blood.
This must be a symbol of the fact that a person can pay for a moment of inconsistency with his life.
Advertisers will be “feared” until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go for the drivers
"The drivers are subject to the 'pull it, let it go' system.
For them, 'get it' is when, for example, they cross the red, saving time.
"Put it" is a danger of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why we need an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, says the psychologist.
According to him, the signs calling the driver's attention to danger are less effective.
“If a hazard warning board is installed, it is likely that it will soon merge with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the Provisional Israeli Government, spoke of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. from the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview, which was published on Monday by Jediot Achron.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that we have to give back almost all, if not all, of the (displaced) territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to an attack on two cities in July, during which a few people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find “a special solution for the Temple Mount, holy and historic places” in the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said.
Exit from the Golan Plateau
Olmert also gave an opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he felt was an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend a peace treaty with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they must give up the regular support they provide for the terrorism of Hamas, Al-Qaeda and jihad in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after an accident: Are cabin crew members illegal in buses?
They are not known by the law, they are not allowed to travel in long-distance buses.
In connection with the student agency’s tragic bus accident near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether passengers and passengers could travel on the bus.
“If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the passenger attendant’s activity would be in conflict with the law on transport activities,” says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, a twenty-two-year-old passenger attendant was likely killed by a truck driver crossing the bus.
To her misfortune, she was sitting next to the driver at the moment, at the least safe place on the bus, even though there were two more seats available for her.
The bus may collide or suddenly brake at the moment when the cabin attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It depends on whether the bus has a standing position according to the traffic permit.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have a standing area; this has been confirmed by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the company’s director for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this has been withdrawn, and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seat,” he said.
The law does not know the passenger attendant.
"There is no clear legal screening of the role of the cabin crew - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of a driver; it does not define his rights and obligations," said spokesman Hanselka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
“It depends on whether the bus driver’s license has a parking space.
And that's it," he says.
Buses can be urban, according to their distinction, where there are still places and limited to maximum speed, and between city-to-city seats, and with a higher permitted speed, as well as long-distance seats without standing places and seats with a maximum authorised speed, with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, transport safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
“Continuous progress does not pose many threats, and the situation can be compared to service on an aircraft.
It’s not sure when there’s a turbulence and the flight attendant can beat his head.”
“But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, its physical laws apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of cabin crew must be solved by the carrier with internal rules,” he says, and he also believes that the problem has not been solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to discontinue services
Student Agency offers passenger assistance services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 passengers.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky after the accident.
“But as soon as I have the impression that the occupation of the cabin crew is risky, I will also eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers upon boarding.
It would also be cost savings,” he says.
In his vehicles, he justified the lack of passenger escorts for safety reasons by Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have any traveling companions, we have opposed that from the very beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end in some kind of fatal injury,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
An incredible tragedy has happened.
The company’s two-year-old Plze<0xC5><0x88> passenger attendant died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably swung out of the stop lane without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape with a sudden maneuver, but the right front of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved seats for the rest of the flight attendants would have been sold, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-haul flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency does not expect the judgment of the court, but also expects the financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future
The amendment to the law on the bus, which has been working for more than a year for the Transport Ministry’s thirty-member expert group, could be used to clarify the movement of cabin crews.
“The group did not get any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum speed on the motorway and mobile use during driving,” says Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n expert.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of cabin crews to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said in a statement.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s financial institution units and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create “the central capital market organization of the Savings Bank Financial Group”, a letter published on Monday.
WestLB would take a permanently profitable “competence block” into a business like this.
Such a relationship could give a decisive impetus to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board of directors wants to prove its capacity to act in difficult times.
The WestLB bank, which is in a precarious position, continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Administration, which recently announced with the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that the deadline for finding a durable solution is tight.
However, for savings fund clients, the topic of a kind of relationship – also in Frankfurt – has long been a topic between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds.
Franz Waas, the head of the Deka-Bank, announced at the end of August that the merger between the bank on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB would not make sense.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which is composed of representatives of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings bank associations, instructed the Board of Directors to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
However, the negotiations, according to the financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3,000 employees, the name of Deca-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first time that the savings bank sector has been consolidated.
In 2003, for a moment, the Deka-Bank seemed to merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, none of this triple alliance has turned out to be.
The plans were scarcely made public, and the Hesse provincial government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the provincial banks came up again and again.
However, last time, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need for the convergence of the various banks in the sector.
Now, after the provincial elections in Bavaria, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg is expected for the first time.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further fusion increases, potential partners may slowly run out.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger business partner, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen with a 85% business share in Helaba.
The NordLB is missing.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and Court Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be provided for the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is possible to split WestLB, which they do not want there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also states that they are definitely looking for a "complete solution".
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend".
It's Elena's first, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-branded five-liter barrel, stands a man with a strong beard and proves to some 200 people traveling to the Oktoberfest how deep the sounds can be drawn out of his throat.
Elena first covers Luca's face, then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Train Station, four buses depart at 23.45 for the "destinazione Monaco, festa della" destination, expected to arrive at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, while the fourth is exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans started singing alongside their flag, and they started celebrating during the night.
And it's so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, synthetic-lined jacket and wide, silver-skinned glasses.
He travelled to the Oktoberfest five years ago, only this year he organized three trips.
At night, at the Oktoberfest, at 2:30 p.m., home.
The accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and a German-language tour in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act - a German course in Marco Frankfurt.
And the buses are already throwing themselves into the night on the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, no beer.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
All right, you're gonna need your strength.
Brixen and Holzkirchen take a break, where many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on Highway 8.
When Marco’s team arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past six o’clock, there are already nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding another final briefing.
First of all, wear the yellow cap.
On the left is the inscription "Oktoberfest" written in fractional letters, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviagiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the beer tent open, run," cried Marco into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
“Not in advance, for we are stuck, and not all the yellow capes are sitting on the same benches, but let us scatter in the tent.”
The one-liter jar costs 8.25 euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Let the security guard know you're doing well.
As you leave your seats, they will be occupied.”
Third, "Be here again at half past eleven tonight." Do you understand?
And now we're heading to Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men would tie yellow caps on trees, boards, and even an election poster for a large Bavarian People's Party.
You have to be prepared to retire.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no accurate figures; there are 50,000 people who cross the Alps in their beer tents, and about 10% of all visitors to the weekend come from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, and Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics takes the first place with about 200 medical care, in order to prevent the Austrians (about 80) and the Brits who are at the bottom of the podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for the lenders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and even added that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that happened this weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received billions of loans from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies would be €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
In the background there are losses from the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a news release, Depfa, which is making state funding, has lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself to them for a very short period of time - which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio also decreased moderately from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net cash receipts fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenues from debt credits and specified securities, as well as from the liquidation of the credit business's reserves, falling to more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex post accounting costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the duty regulation and the transactions made to the companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively moderate income deficit of around 16%.
After the privatisation in 1990, the former state financier first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
As classical public funding was scarcely sought, Depfa was more strongly involved in infrastructure projects, private-public partnerships (PPPs) and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to make descriptions that have a "substantial impact" on the Group's profit and loss, they said in a rather general manner.
In fact, there was no dividend payment.
The dividend was reduced to a third in 2007.
Since the takeover of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financer.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the banks’ lending to each other has been depleted, as banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – some €50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered for the time allowed by the loan, and the company is protected from “the influence of the currently largely inoperable international financial markets.”
According to other sources, thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate group does not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Administration (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, they cannot be certain of it.
It is not even conceivable that there is no need to make full use of funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Saturday night’s news that the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, the temporary rescue of the bank could not calm the moods.
The stock price fell to EUR 3.30 with a 75 percent decrease.
Bond rates, on the other hand, are pretty good.
While the first-ranked debt barely changes, the back-ranked bond exchange rates fell significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and, as far as possible, the longer-term maturity beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their value stability must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the banking crisis escalating and the fact that the financial institution took the crisis home with Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the scheme, it is possible to start with the early repayment of the benefits.
Or it will happen where almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports on partial nationalisation, the probability bound by certainty has now been reduced to a mere legitimate rememory.
For long-term lenders, the decision to opt out of their investment may result in sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange gains over the coming years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the inside box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls begin to whine: The German girl is absolutely "kapia"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about manga - in the new exchange student blog she tells about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was really excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
The students begin to ring from eight o’clock until at eight o’clock 40 a.m. a short conversation with the teacher, the “home room”.
But before the teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt from my housekeeper, plus a blouse, blue knee bra and black leather shoes.
So in this dress I stood in front of your cathedral and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Syonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be.
At this point I was very happy that I had been learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, waving and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavai".
I already knew that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "chicken, sweet."
Then I quickly fell to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely and felt honoured to have the exchange students seated next to her.
The rest of the clock was calm enough, but when the bell sounded, they ran away regularly.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - and it's quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their ben<0xC3><0xB3>.
My host also made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of tofu-covered meat.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Yeah, except for the salty plum soup, brrrrr.
In Japanese schools, bento is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with a benta she has made with her own hands, which she creates especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
“Why is Japan?” my friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Because he's just enchanting."
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they describe, I started to study Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are highly esteemed here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life.”
Rats have emotions too.
A rat or a moth escapes in case of danger. Does that mean you feel fear?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For years, scientists have been publishing their articles in the Internet magazine "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain is the same.
However, as we look at other species and examine the issues of perception or, in general, consciousness, we arrive in difficult terrain, because the hardware is not the same.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers deduce comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
The two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animals.
On the one hand, human-conscious circuits almost always contain the side prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This wide area is higher in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are, or in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it can be reasonably assumed that man is different from even other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that it depends on consciousness.
In this case, the animals can be excluded.
However, even if the language were not dependent on the mind, the language would certainly be influenced, so that the animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and due to the special hardware it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research will bring us serious problems.
Most of my reflections relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualization.
However, this assumption, examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What follows from this in terms of emotions?
This is due to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity (or its consequences, for example, bodily reactions) of a localized defense system in the brain occupies a working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially of humans.
In addition to language, perception is divided into subtle stages, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorise states in order to describe them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from the simpler activities of the cortex and the body-sensing areas of the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in emotions that encompass species.
Well, I can't refute that theoretically, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is probably also felt in both cases: How to check if rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in the same way?
A cockroach flees in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although neural matching continues to help: rats and humans have a similar brain strain, cockroaches don’t have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this can be proven for humans, how can we prove this for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are supposed to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I am more interested in the emotional behavior of rats than in their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is lauded at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not search for language and consciousness, nor do I search for emotions, because I do not know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to someone else, but I'm moving forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: A Time of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux and the proof that they believe that Ukraine, together with Poland, is able to organise the European Championship,” Vasyunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries.”
As regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
The number of EB stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
“We need to work at a top speed,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
“The UEFA will keep an eye on us.”
In Poland, they wanted to take an even more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by the Independent Inspector Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Mr Miroslav Drzewiecki, Minister of Sport.
“There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate under the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish PAP news agency.
"In a letter, we have assured Michel Platini, UEFA President, that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 EB."
Only in the last season had several first liga teams to be classified in the lower class due to manipulation, and finally the ligatar had to be postponed.
Annoyed Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, she talked about her private life in the interview - and now her problem with her ex-husband has been overcome.
The One Who Screams - and Strikes Back
The War of the Late Roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors fight each other seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan said for the first time last week: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain.”
And only after the divorce did he find out how many women Dennis cheated on.
The spiritual stripper was the result of Ryan’s press work on his new film, “Women,” which tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid said: “It’s horrible,” 54-year-old actor told New York Daily News, “that Meg is boringly repeating and spending the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it is also "sorry" that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce brings to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following page cut: “My life will continue anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in perfect order.”
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European air travel and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, air travel in Germany is no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of air travel and hotel rooms have become more favorable once again – this is how the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider can be summarized.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008, and after a price increase in the first quarter, it found a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as a reason for its low dollar rate, which has led to “the slowing travel of American tourists.”
The decrease in hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
The price of flights also showed an increasing trend in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the prices of business and first-class flights showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany fell by half.
On the one hand, the reason for the price decline lies in decreasing economic growth, the company says.
Demand in many segments of the aviation market has weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, strengthens the competitive pressure.
The strained situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their loss-making flights and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - it only affects 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the forefront of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flying for national team Marko Marin.
The player from Gladbach only got into play late, and his raise bounced back from the goalkeeper.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger, in the corridor leading to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was a physiotherapist for HSV for nearly three decades, gaining more prestige than some former players.
So your request found a hearing at the appropriate location.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg manager Martin Jol.
His command could have been like this: give me the second goal!
The execution of the command has not been completed.
“Today was not always a beautiful sight,” said Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "fettered his imagination" about it.
The goal score of 1:0 (1:0) is due to the head of the Hamburgers Mladen Petric (11th); and to the fact that the very weak Gladbachians were not able to cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which showed their team as the first class in the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” said Marcell Jansen.
The intermediate certificate in the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly, but not yet brilled, thanks to its late committed compositions - the Brazilian Names and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern.
"We need more sense and more action," demanded Jol.
After the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
As a result of the first news of the failed rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in his history in a day.
Later, the Dow grew somewhat stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was well below 5% and stood at 10,579 points.
Nasdaq, a technology paper trader, dropped by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
No paper was strengthened.
Goldman Sachs Bank's shares have fallen by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, Warren Buffett was a big investor in the bank.
In the context of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the State would receive stock option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be selected in the event of an appropriate exchange rate evolution, reducing the burden on the State Treasury.
The European and American and Stock Exchanges
Billions of aid to European and American banks will not dispel investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German capital bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and it is taking the Dax with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is declining despite the state-scheduled bailout of the money market.
Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank’s spectacular price losses have pushed the German share index (Dax) into the negative.
The value of Munich’s real estate financing stock fell to a quarter despite the federal government and private banks bailout, while Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and scored 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent negative.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, down 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also know only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a drop of 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after the initial increase.

Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said that Thomas Cook’s shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for nearly 18 years.
Due to the soon-to-be-frozen fuel pipelines, the threat of frostbite is imminent.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational rock maneuver of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in a celestial body, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
Thus, probes can save a large amount of fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, a European-American research probe, used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
But what has amazed researchers for years: Flying objects do not behave as expected under the ancient law of gravitation.
Instead, there are anomalies in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was dubbed swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which perceives the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, still firmly believes that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts discovered in the universe.
“For anomaly, dark matter may be responsible, which may even be found near Earth,” Adler wrote.
The existence of dark matter has been known to space scientists only ten years ago.
It obviously exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to have an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or repel any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
According to scientists, a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt have been released
After spending ten days in the custody of their abductors, tourists deported to Egypt are again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Over and over again, Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists deported in the Sahara are free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab television and Italian media.
According to reports from 24 Italian television stations Sky TG, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our compatriots and other hostages have been freed.
We are currently looking at their health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian citizen and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: An Egyptian security official said the hostages had already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed them.
“The problem is solved.
The ransom was accepted," the official said.
"It was just about taking hostages," when suddenly "the surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, citing a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostage-taking women are released after the ransom has been paid.
Men are held captive by kidnappers until a safe escape route is found.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a stand on the report.
"Involved in Suicide" by Stepfather Violence
The court said a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
57-year-old Michael Trerise, who lives in Stithians County, Cornwall, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight-order rape attempts.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that she had regularly tied her stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her eyes before intercourse while her mother was working in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his home again.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was persecuted by nightmares of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, said her friends were “emotional dead” and “departed from life.”
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was in conflict with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter saying, "I've always tied him up and tied his eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I’m sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended up with the victim committing suicide.
What is even more striking is the fact that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought to justice.”
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact Stephanie's parents have had on their daughter over the years.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials who lost important data have been charged
According to the BBC, a government official who dropped secret documents on a train in June has been charged with violating official secrecy.
The man was on a mission from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional misconduct.
Frank Gardner, a reporter for the BBC Department of Defense, said the move surprised many people at Whitehall.
“They thought the Department of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been prosecuted under section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the retention of information.
The state prosecutor's office suggested that the charges brought against the clerk should be represented by the Metropolitan Police because of the man's rather sensitive work on the Unified Intelligence Commission.
The documents he lost included secret surveys of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Home-building cooperatives pay their B&amp;B account
Britain’s housing cooperatives could expect an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after saving the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits held by Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of deposit holders, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), it is “disgusting” that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion major loans will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been acting prudently so far... now have to pay the bills of those institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We found out that every company has to pay the amount of deposit it owns. The companies share 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that those institutions have to pay the bills of the much less cautious institutions that acted prudently during the boom of the housing market.”
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since the start of operations in 1945.
“We need to look at this matter in every way in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills,” Cole said.
The interest due in 2009 will cover 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full-year interest rate, which could be twice as much as it is now.
Since housing-building cooperatives without self-help organizations, without shareholders, eventually the members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced Monday that it will raise its wholesale price of milk by an additional five pence per litre.
This is the second price increase this year since the two pence increase in February and following a survey by an advisory company.
Retailers decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey was last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladesh MP’s request for freedom of defence has been denied
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request for defence of former MP Sheikh Hasina, which means that he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court had refused to defend him from being released on charges of stealing 50 million taka from a businessman during his parliamentary term ( $729,700).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against it.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country’s military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although they were conditionally released to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions for setting free are not clear as to whether they can preserve their freedom when they return to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the court of appeal.
“The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s application for bail by saying that there is no need for it, since he has been temporarily released and is undergoing medical treatment abroad,” said lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself on parole so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
Last year, he was arrested after an army-backed provisional government took power, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges brought against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organized polio vaccination program due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this has happened despite the Taliban’s promise: they will not attack or obstruct the work of thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV has been rejected
BskyB’s appeal was denied against the decision of the Competition Law Commission, which ordered it to reduce its interest in the rival TV broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission found that BSkyB’s stake in the company hampers competition and gives the company an unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of a stake in ITV jeopardises ITV’s independence, encouraging the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin’s director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups, and Ofcom supervision all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV participation was a pointless and disproportionate reparation, in particular because BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearance of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move followed that the report on the case, prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former chief state prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because he was afraid that the state prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have tried to block the judiciary by lying.
“Serious allegations of possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified,” said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to order witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine state prosecutors from the U.S. Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the state prosecutors were dismissed for their poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the lost state prosecutors received nothing worse than many of their other colleagues, which led many to conclude that there was political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors took part in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud allegations against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and conducting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be lost at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Justice Department, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks by the Attorney General on the grounds of the disappearances and eventually resigned.
Several other officials of the Justice Department have also resigned.
In his report, Gonzales was highly critical of his role in the case, arguing that the Chief Prosecutor was "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "rejected" from his role as the Chief Inspector General, and "significantly withdrawn" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush helper, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic receives recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out of Hell".
The singer, who will receive her special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said she was honoured.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title song for Meat Loaf's 1977 album, which was a popular success.
Coldplay has received the most nominations for this year’s awards, and has been nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend the boundaries of time or genres, and the “Bat Out of Hell” is like that.”
The song by Jim Steinman required a very loud voice, and that voice was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental session.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" album was featured on the charts for almost nine years, and more than 40 million copies were sold after that.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, is currently struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003, after falling on stage, he had surgery for a heart rhythm disorder.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute larynx.
Later it turned out that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown big city street that is often forgotten, and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, avenues, and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others merely perform practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time local residents could hardly tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and is much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
You can't find it on a standard map.
But the streets have admirers.
It is there, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to refurbish the Extra Place and ensure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be reached on a cleaner road.
Among the admirers of the street are the long-standing neighbors who were caught in the truncated streets, that it was the only remnant of the area’s past before the renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building preservation and development department of the city has no interest in sticking to it.
This month, at a meeting of the district council’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, head of the district of municipal body No. 3.
“There are very few areas in the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city,” he said.
“There may be suggestions for refurbishment and treatment that Avalon can make, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-enact the small street and provide seats. Some of these would be used by a cafe, the builder of which is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
“The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this alley and turn it into a pleasant public place,” he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s job was to develop buildings rather than manage them.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, it was named "the land of each" when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow land lane.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the CBGB’s back exit to Extra Place opened, and the street is perhaps the most notable one of the photographs taken on the cover of Ramones’ album “Rocket to Russia”.
"It was a beautiful place," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, cloth fragments, barrels and posters, as well as wood leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest it may be, must remain in the community’s possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the writer of the blog “Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York” (“The Book of Revelations: the bitter nostalgia that contemplates the process of the city’s extinction”), posted on his blog part of the story of Extra Place, which appeared in the column “Városi sz<0xC3><0xB3>lás” of the weekly newspaper “The New Yorker” in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end that is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron storage doors and spalty windows, and where the wind carries a week of newspapers in the canals.”
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to the high-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty bottle of 0.75 liters of beer lay next to a discarded, fresh newspaper pile.
Some passers-by said that they rarely think about Extra Place, but they think they could use the renovation.
Fields said some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher and senior director of education research at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute in California, co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to obtain a degree than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s educational plan explicitly supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on non-English language school education, overcomes his interest in overcoming high performance differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, as a contract primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, study English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It’s equally impressive that 93% of fourth graders passed the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and that’s what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is to “fully immerse” English students in the linguistic environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in the teaching of other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: “We have had a tremendous success in walking into a classroom and noticing who the student was who had come from Mexico 12 months before.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set other schools such as Sixth Street Prep as an example to follow, with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-educated students?
The results achieved by the school should be clear, but due to the educational policy of its own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it itself consistently advocates bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently expressed contempt for the issue when he said that people shouldn’t be so concerned about the “exclusively English nature” of legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should be able to make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America’s bailout plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil securities fell seven percent to $99.80 in the morning on the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchanges have been shaken by the Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before being again subject to the immeasurable uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, concerns seized investors again, even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest in history to date.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for long.
Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking business as the latest event in the unfolding crisis, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "it seems that the rescue operation has failed to revive the trading spirit of the stock exchange."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, such as oil, is also expected to decline.
“The future of the stock, interest rates and currency exchange markets has become uncertain around the world,” an analyst at Deutsche Bank told investors.
“We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the ‘disease’.
The biggest question for the stock market is the extent to which the “disease” of the United States infects the whole world, especially China.”
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone else in the past eight seasons, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the loose play of the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals was brought into full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, which was the perfect precursor to an afternoon during which their cooperation developed significantly.
Favre also gave Coles two touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't feel sorry for the trouble," Favre said of all of Coles' passports.
“He’s a good player.
We have been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' manager, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who plays cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw it back with 32 yards, which hit touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing part of the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter of a year.
When asked by Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-boggling character of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets scoring one - Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We scored a lot in a short time.”
Rested Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance and mid-distance runner ever to be when he broke his world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run 42.2 kilometres in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the comfortably flat track at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous result at 2:04:26, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set the 26th world record for his career in so many fields that he won a world championship or a world record from 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution would exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he was nominated for the Berlin Marathon.
Gebrselassie won in almost perfect conditions – in sunny weather, initially at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and finally at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C – on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since non-runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, his two legs were cramped and he could not train for two weeks.
It is obvious that during the forced rest he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so glad," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“It all worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything was fine.”
He has received some criticism, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival in East Africa, that he uses too many aids during his races, usually avoids many world-renowned marathoners, relies on his pacers as if he were running on the track, and puts world records before the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie’s magnificence in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the final point on Sunday with the help of four Kenyan Imamfuts in 1:02:04.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the pacemakers got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the finish, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a final sprint, who finished second with 2:05:36, five minutes at his best.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The world record is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was surprised to win the London Marathon with a result of 2:24:14.
He was not allowed to participate in the Beijing Olympics because of his alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his personal peak by five minutes. This was the third marathon run he took part in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then, after about 30 km, he came after them.
The Ethiopian Askele Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of blacks
The experience park in Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything that glitters, loud and powerful, hides in a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African American experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country, which was Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood home, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: “The five lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two schools without prison.”
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, which is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida Guide to the Federal Writers of the Crisis, is distinct from its surroundings.
Just as independent, dignified, and enclosing as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the Florida, urban blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama is encouraging an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of the looks of outsiders.
“We take great care to tell our story,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to tell me correctly."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the blacks’ stand-out, and at the same time, it is a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty indicators double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of a sometimes depreciated, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that thrives in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the residents here are both proud and defensive at the same time.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everybody calls Hurston here).
In books written in an honest, powerful dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he presented his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17, which leads from Florida’s long-forgotten center to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave both in life and in literature, like drumming, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find a modern public school on the right of the road, with a white border on a brown background, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller cares about, though he can barely read and write."
She mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodation."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
I really didn’t like this description for everyone.
"Zora said things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting from the smoky songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a bustling Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing long pants in a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were captivated.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, “Never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporaries, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, were buried in an unsigned tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he had lived before.
Eatonville had no major memoirs or large, public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much it enriched the world or what it left us,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, “covered in a rainbow.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane route through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orland<0xC3><0xB3> has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles over racial blending tasted hatred with the community.
"At the time, a group of white boys came over and threw the people sitting on the side of the road with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
“There was a woman who died of this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car.”
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s decision to forcefully integrate, saying that “Brown v. Board of Education” “would rather be insulting than respecting my race.”
Today, residents say that the desecration of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
“Black children are used to killing them – I remember – the man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the nonprofit organization “Keep Eatonville Community.”
“This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many others in the rise of Zora Neale Hurston—black writers, actors, and artists who have transcended prejudices, as he did, with such cheerful self-confidence and lines as this: “How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker took a trip to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a renowned biography of Hurston, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of the bookstores, which re-emphasised him as a role model for America.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again at the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community organized a Hurston festival to show what the county would ruin with its main route.
Thousands of fans have come to the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its road construction proposal.
"The five-banding of the main road has brought the community back to full speed, which is a true civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people living outside the city, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started attending church in 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historic List in 1998.
In 2006, a new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) was opened on the re-enacted and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida’s cuckoo egg: it’s not exactly ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rains; it’s as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They are still being taken with caution by outsiders who come here in search of Eatonville's story and what to say.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things, such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting black people working on the ground, should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many people, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, are afraid of misinterpreting their separate communities.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown also grew.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as the way Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, with its problems and everything else, neither better nor worse, just as proud, creative, diligent, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
Frankly civil attachment is silenced by the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work at the local government or the police after graduating from college, which he believes will require help.
And it seems that even the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Kenon said on Sunday.
“But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, then this is a very nice city.”
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t care about the newspaper stalls and the huge television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, bee-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who hold New York in power have been living the most difficult days since 1929.
The couriers are still rounding their metal tea carts on the pavements, carrying trays loaded with muffins for morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips are still whispering among the block houses, carrying fifty-and-a-half pairs of undressed shirts that hang on a loop that resembles a yoke on their shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their morning sweet pastry at the food trolleys on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays.
I didn’t feel like there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
While I was deliberately planning to take care of it during the rest of the afternoon in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, there were already 20 people in front of me.
Not at the banker’s window, where you can pick up money or make a deposit, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy’s store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the banker who ordered me - were in line with the same intention as I was.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in a single state and supposedly treat their clients as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been silently destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, has been bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made a savings of 440 billion dollars.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, took their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank that makes the most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance in the past few weeks.
A woman on her phone in a local Chinese store spoke about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and his huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the house block of my apartment, changed the theme of a man in uniform, who had his fifties, and we were not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food delivery as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves were desecrated while Austria fell to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, at which he presented the organization "Contraries Against the Transfiguration of Islam".
There were signs of traffic signs depicting mosques that had been crossed by a red line.
According to the police, far-right extremists are responsible for the abuse of the Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which took place on the same weekend when far-right parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators said they were only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in some way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the funeral ceremony, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience test following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance of Austria, a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18% of the votes, also expressed his displeasure with the campaign against headgear and burqas, as well as his displeasure with food supposedly linked to Islam.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood" to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to the polls and analyses carried out after the elections, which led directly to the victory of the far right, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from travelling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child sexual assault, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after informing the authorities controlling him of their intention to travel through France to Spain.
Police in Kent were banned from travelling on Thursday after providing evidence of rape convictions against children against Glitter in court.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend Ashford Magistrates' trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokeswoman said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police filed a petition with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd hasn't appeared in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is required by the Act on the Register of Sexual Crime Victims.
You should inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police say they don’t want to talk about individual cases and possible whereabouts within Glitter County.
A spokesman for the Kent Police Department said: “The Kent Police Department is doing everything it can to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons registered in the register of sexual offenders and those living in the county, in order to minimise potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The provincial authorities refused to pass the passport test and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer David Corker went to the Court of Justice in West London, uxbridge, because, according to a request from Scotland Yard, he was admitted to the register of sexual offenders under a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take photos on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal perspective" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer
No set, no ribs, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close by, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate, far away from the audience, when we can make a personal move, grasp the depth of a captured gaze, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist who is not preparing for the performance.
In his German photo series Flamenco-people, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, flamenco presents its specific iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography’s Month, “reflects the growing international importance of flamenco from day to day,” the creator says, adding that Flamenco-people “can be anyone’s role as the observer realizes that these images are not typical of artists.
These people on the street are artists who are capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivating the audience.
However, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the very depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival gave a boost to Bauer’s long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and theme selection, evoke classic photography.
However, the application of various stylistic instruments breaks with traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, varies from day to day and is always impressive."
It is not the dance itself, nor the song itself, nor the music itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist that charms the audience.
The guiding motif of the works that can be viewed in the El Photomatá gallery in the days is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic crow, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and presentation.
Known figures of flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has also become flamenco anthology, of which an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer’s passion for portraits for two years has prompted him to repeat the idea with the “SportART project” series.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like photographing people, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you meet people who sometimes you don't even know, or who just take a few minutes to photograph.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition entitled Flamenco-people, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, can be viewed in El Photomata Gallery, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, on October 16.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "ready-made courage"
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel, starring Irish nationalist Roger Caseman, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and has been in the Amazon.
The literary Nobel Prize-winning writer at the Hay Festival Segovia yesterday admitted that his current work is "ready-made courage" and "all indications that the novel should not be written".
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it, and I hope I can make it to the end sometime,” he concluded with these words at the Festival of Thought, Thought and Opinion Exchanges, which hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most outstanding participants of the literary holiday, and he also redeemed the hopes attached to it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our Common Friend" novel. His performance filled Juan Bravo theater.
Félix Romeo was greeted by a devoted audience. For the audience, the hour was quickly cut short, during which the Peruvian writer, with a remarkable memory and a great amount of humor, told the story of how his writing vocation evolved from the unique adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing methods, with a lot of diligent documentation.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added: “I don’t think literature is merely entertainment or a life-long experience of lizards,” because it has an impact on people and thinking, so he asked writers not to allow the seduction of lightness and to bear responsibility for their vocation.
Due to the harsh weather, the farewell to Pozoblanco is shorter, horse bullfights are also missed
The horse bullfight, traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco holidays, was cancelled from the show yesterday morning after the future horse torreadors found the arena’s terrain unsuitable for the fight.
As a result, the Committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to miss the bullfight.
The weather storms have thoroughly torn the celebration series, as two of the three events could not be held.
Saturday was the second bullfight due to rain.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, would have fought with the Castilblanco bulls.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was brought around shoulder to shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante earned a number of awards and trophies through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than to his own performance.
But then El Juli followed, who contributed little to the renewal of the reputation of the Los Llanos Arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, we managed to get most of the audience out of the wire.
A truck carrying two tons of hash tried to escape road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police carries out traffic control in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authority stops a van in which two people travel. Passengers try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, at the same time, was not conspicuous.
Investigators have pursued the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, has been arrested and identified as A. A. J., the Basque government’s Department of Internal Affairs said.
The man was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n, where traffic control was carried out by the employees of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Control on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometres away on the landing lane, and his passengers fled from the highway towards a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after inspecting the Iveco Daily-branded van, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hash whales filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by police to undergo a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proved that the vehicle's false license plate does not match the data contained in the van's papers, and therefore the arrested person is also prosecuted for falsification of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation to arrest the other suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, fled the highway and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A. A. J., was sent to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and court action began within a few hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of the drug.
A witness said he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesman for the California traffic control agency People told reporters.
According to the witness, at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, blew the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backward, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Soon after, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"It looked like a bug," so the patrols took him to a drug and alcohol testing center specializing in this.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately ruled out. The spokesperson also said that at the first impression of the officers, Locklear was thought to be under the influence of a drug.
Lockleart was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was taken to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalucian Federation of IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the secretary-general of the IU and a representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the unit will decide on the case of former youth and sports councillor Francisco Manuel Silva of the Seville Municipality. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to give benefits to his family members.
"In these matters I am far from a federalist, and this is a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out to the way in which the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that in detecting any irregularities that Silva may have committed, the "transparency" should be kept in mind: "At IU has always been on the verge of ensuring that such cases are fully transparent."
He added that part of the training was "the strict code of ethics for public employees."
"Mayan Blood", epic work by Garci
Benito Pérez’s Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s National Episode inspired José Luis Garci, who evoked the Spanish’s famous anti-French uprising in the May blood, the largest film in his filmography, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis he had always admired in his well-known novelist’s work. Garci told the audience of actors at the film show today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a.
The more than two and a half hours of May blood will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will screen it as a miniseries for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, realized his childhood dream with this film. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the story could be based on the National Epid.
The budget of 15 million was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and meant a special opportunity for Garci: he could present "the troubled Spaniards, who were mistakenly standing next to the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence has pushed the country into a huge backward state with Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
The director, however, expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya, who had more than doubled the May blood, and therefore had to skip a few scenes from the script, which, like many other times, are recorded with Valcárcelle Horacio.
So the director of the Restart used his usual working method, he recorded the scenes with the actors with whom he had already started rehearsals before the filming. Casting was not, because Garci thought it was "parallel" and because, as he said, "the director's profession is part of going to the theater and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
Several of the May blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga, and Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar, believes that this year’s nominees for Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. none of the May blood, the Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected Blind Sunflowers, represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “where it should be presented,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this movie.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for posterity, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and in the end, you’re happy to have another movie done,” Garci says with a 30-year professional career behind her back.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville commemorates a dancer in Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia from the Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) was born in Triana and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert of oriental dances.
During his busy life, he fought for women’s equality as a pioneer, whether it was Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that impede women's freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution erupted in war-torn Europe, his life enthralled Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended to me T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his spirit.
I remember the flamenco styles of his dances.
For example, the tango from the "dance of the butterfly" to the guaji, or from the "dance of the snake".
"He was dancing intelligently and others thought it was my style," he says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the Open Door, now sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
Matilde plays the older T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the invitation, and it's a great honour to be performing in my play."
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n singers; El Pájaro percussionist, Rafa El Viola viola viola viola and Juanfra Juárez actor, who "plays a permanent character that constantly destroys the real diva with his love."
The play also largely showcases the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and reaches even distant landscapes at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remember him because his personality had a big impact on his own age, but nowadays he is no longer known and even less appreciated for his work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance will begin tonight at 8:30 p.m. at Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the journal of a newly married poet will also be published.
The first illustrated edition of the diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs called Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium (2006-2008), organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>s Regional Government.
In this way, the closing ceremony of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium will be the re-release of this work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning poet’s memorial house and the “Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Bright Summer Tree” exhibition.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalucian Regional Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of Perdo Tabernero's diary of a newly married poet, illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in The Victims of the Sensation, and reflects the shock and impotentity that Newman’s death caused in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it is to get an Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
And he was known to be sick,
But still everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, in tears, "his existence has made my life better and this country better."
No one was afraid that he might become ridiculous or overdo it.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went through a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people we can look up to, there is no need to be Luis Cervada to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he truly represented the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation in memory of his first son, who died of drug overdose, to the creation of his home-made bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had a hard time overcoming its suicidal eating culture.
The sweeping wave of admiration traveled all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality or origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said it was not a man, but an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newmann was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has made the bar very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, one of the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today: they demand honesty and serious privacy away from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in the midst of today’s media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He divorced once, but then married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, although he would certainly have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why do I eat hamburgers somewhere else when the meat is at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
“He was not as proud of any of his plays as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted philanthropist,” he says.
The Road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympic Games in Madrid, and after the 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start yesterday's race, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of all I've ever been.
It was characterized by a bundle of senselessness, and if I had to be evaluated once, and I was the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
But let's go ahead and start at the beginning.
The senselessness started with taking over the serial number, because it had to arrive earlier.
This in itself is not a problem, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in the later queue).
That's not what happened.
At first, they only gave me the serial number (first senselessness, only to get there sooner) and (after standing in the usual line), how surprising it was to wear an S-shirt (second senselessness, because I have an XL size for me)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save on the material and buy only cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that the chip had to be picked up at an awfully early age, the queue took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up on the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant to wait for more than 40 minutes, which was the result of popular uprising and stand-up attempts.
I think tomorrow we'll get about 500 sure pneumonias, and some of us, including myself, will not get our place in the actual time, because I assume the chip has fixed the start incorrectly.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for a receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence that, however, is capable of performing some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on the company’s territory) based on the information heard from the conversation.
With the help of a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this "reception" can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even remember what clothes they are wearing - as well as hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those who are present based on the conversations.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company talking to her, nor does she belong to the company’s employee.
He asks if he has come to visit someone and makes sure that he is in a hurry to help them.
It's all without the big blue screen.
It's amazing.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
At the moment, the company also has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft’s strategy had changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster – bravo, Steve, that’s something.
They invented Spanish wax, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of course will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google took the first step towards becoming a Windows competitor.
Many people have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an indispensable element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
You're in the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to calculate the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and there is more and more time spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and ultimately provide an alternative to Google.
They need all of this, and I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken early this month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
In the soda machine, a poster invites them to use the company's browser. - "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not arrive in early 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones function more and more like computers.
But slipping, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Crusader, as well as one of the basic costumes of the mature gay public.
And while we are on the list of specialties, we can also recall the peace figure of the cuckoo weight lifter of the travelling circus.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than a men's cotton jersey, typically narrow and sleeveless.
That is, the "tank" as the English call it, but none of its rivals can compete with the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although among friends it is referred to as "Marcel" - which is due to the sport, legend has it that Marcel Cerdan was named after the boxer, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton material, unisex tailoring, distinctive emblem and small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag make it stand out among his competitors. The latter is the most characteristic models that carry it hidden in the neck of the shirt.
However, the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, seafarer T-shirts, baby clothes, mini-series - and we could even list them - are all part of the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also unfortunate that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he was able to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
At the moment, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than having some pretty and pretty girls give her a name for something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris and at the transfer of the most prestigious fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
There is a lot of warmth and mildness in it.
What are you doing in Paris?
We will present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which we designed with my brother Penélopa. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second application of the Mango Fashion Awards and at the gala dinner at the Opera in honour of Valentino.
Quite a busy day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; we took a lot of it from there.
And then, often, I just walk around the city and watch women dress, change and pick out their clothes - this is one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a versatile woman, right?
I think so too, but after all, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, so I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and spend time in my aunt's wardrobe.
Well, that was you on the Cana, almost in the middle of an amusement park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and rehearsals so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected to everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you go to lethargy?
Oh, no, no.
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really worth it by this time, they've experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock does not worry.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want to do, and that makes me very happy inside.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother, because as a woman I was born for this, and even I want to be a young mother, I certainly don’t want to miss that.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child with happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you filmed several movies that haven't been shown yet.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I look forward to the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you say to them...
As far as I know, you made your debut on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go up to the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she arranged for her own organization, Women for a better world. I chose two of her own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned, and the money was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
I know so many things about him, and I can assure you that half of them are not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me to do the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do the same.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I do not know the impossible.
Falling drunk drivers will be forced to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving offences, the Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, which states that the pilot project will last for a year.
As the aim of the project is to re-enter the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the General Public Prosecutor’s Office for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the FITSA Foundation for Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) also participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested several times because of drunk driving are back in the car.
Alcolock would prevent this, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the inflated air. If it is larger than allowed, or if the driver did not inflate at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the infringer.
A study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, this rule is estimated to save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming criminal offences,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require amendment of the Fundamental Law.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although in experimental mode it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party which, on the basis of the French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English precision, at the time announced in the program, at 17:40 a.m., the Spanish Air Force landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City on a plane carrying the Princely Party of Asturias.
The sun was already running out, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal party coming out of the plane using our hands as an eye-catcher.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other distinguished personalities stood.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince Couple was coming to town for an official visit.
Okay, well, there's not gonna be an airport transfer for a long time today... the woman from around here or something.
- No, no, sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something...
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Princely Couple of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, at the cordon created by the 27 Marines, who protect their dignity.
The Prince appears smiling, wearing a navy blue dress, and then the Princess, too, gets her long hair in the wind, in her restrained clothes, but not in the usual shoes that flash out her toes – perhaps they warned Mexico City would be threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception takes place.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are greeted by a reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
A fashion prize to hand over is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world in Paris, and among today’s most sophisticated and cool fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards competition, which aims to introduce young talent in the fashion industry internationally.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designer clothes in the Mango window under 54 of the Paris boulevard Haussmann, and she was almost relieved of her influence.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest European store and recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The largest store is in London.
In the midst of many events and thanks to Valentino for the jury’s presidency, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the gala dinner’s presidential table, prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Nati, who had come with a heavy heart and sadness because of her brother's recent death, was wearing a piece of the Company and some of ELAH's breathtaking ornaments. She accompanied Valentin, along with her son Luis, who was about two meters tall, to the main table of the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Along with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they eventually left without a suit, as they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own-designed pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During the night’s opera visit to Gaya Toledo’s company, she fell in love with the ballet room, so that, recalling the old days, she slipped into one of the bars and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not take part in the visit to the palace, but before that he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he's two meters tall and he's riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said he didn't want any scents in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l<0xC3><0xA0> l<0xC3><0xA0>, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress relief number
Not 1000, but 1000 and one way to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that we can find them all in a single book that will arrive in the bookstores on September 30th to bring you peace of mind.
It’s almost embarrassing to hear the clock ring at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast the world is forcing you to live each day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is a common disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily fatigue and overcome workplace problems.
No, that number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so everyone can find a solution that is most comfortable and adaptable to their free minutes.
The stress relief work bears the title of the 1001 relaxation method, and the resulting tranquility comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
In addition, it also provides other ideas that all help to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I’m not talking about those who get upset and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that you spoke at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a disease with high fever), or more regular (daily, weekly or monthly) and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
Often combined with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-time wake-up, night-time bed wear (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As already mentioned, a condition with high fever may be accompanied by stress or heightened excitement.
In any case, little has been studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, it can consist of incoherent words or grumbling, but in contrast, it can also occur in the form of shouting, crying, or prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is any problem causing great anxiety in the background and thus offer a solution.
As we have already mentioned, this is a benign phenomenon, and consequently there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by some other form of sleep disorder that can be treated (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose soothing games and avoid watching scary or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children prone to nervousness or more difficult to relax, we teach some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep more peacefully.
If you still start talking while you sleep, try to keep your calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be superfluous, because the child is unconscious, but it would shrink from sleep.
Despite speaking, he actually continues to sleep and rest.
Keep in mind, if you have multiple episodes of severe anxiety accompanied by this phenomenon, it is advisable to consult a specialist or explore what causes the child to become very anxious.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking him to find out anything.
It would be unnecessary, because you are not so conscious when you sleep that you are not conscious enough to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and the possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as this is just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, Illhaeusern’s team finally took a new boost and won again at home.
Although there was no foul play, the yellow-blacks were placed in a position several times, one of which they could finally win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first goal was shot by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the top corner of the goalkeeper. Then Illhaeusern got to the top and followed each other: Fonderflick tried to shoot at a distance, then Hirn shot at the top of the goalkeeper. Romain spiccel, Diebold tried to defend himself from the goalkeeper.
On the other side, the players concentrated in a block to defend the midfielder, and only the ever-moving Riahi was shot.
The start of the second half promised decisive importance: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the Dannemarie side. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: after Diebold's first shot, he scored the ball with an excellent position in the Ilhaeuserni Marais and then put it into the goal (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goal scorer could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight in a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of its advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the Hungarian team, who just pulled a little back to strengthen their defenses. Only the last few seconds kept some excitement when, after a great rush, the ball got very close to the goalkeeper.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will put a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to make a visit to the port of Le Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a “constructive spirit” and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would “come with concrete proposals.”
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said: “The president will discuss with fishermen what solutions could be used to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers.”
The fishermen are determined to await the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County to slow down traffic, causing congestion of nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's yacht port was also paralysed, but the roads to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not blocked.
On the Quiberon peninsula, roadblocks were placed.
On Monday, the sailors had already witnessed their determination, and in the morning, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel warehouses of the Brest ports, while demonstrations were taking place in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
In Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, for example, fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre, about twenty ships obstructed commercial shipping.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique County, abolished the massive Oil Refinery Block in Donges in the evening.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the ministry to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on its next move and participation in the meeting planned for the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "fishers don't let their demands" and "they don't want to travel to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an unforgettable title character at his home in Connecticut, aged 83, due to death and cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to Paul Newman, an actor who died at the age of 83 and is committed to his profession.
Embraer will not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the global economic crisis, Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, can keep its plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is highly counting on the Chinese market, especially with regard to its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Over the past eight years, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been set up by US financial authorities, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion in advance, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would be separated from most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of selling.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset pool to be sold by AIG includes the company’s international leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on the sale.
AIG must quickly access liquid assets to repay a $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders.
Paris Historique's study of Morning Meeting's historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bailout plan. The Dow Jones index dropped by 6.98% (which is an unprecedented decline of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) decreased by 777.68 points, resulting in a close of 10,365.45 points.
The biggest decline in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attack.
Based mainly on technology papers, Nasdaq closed with a drop of 1,983.73 points, while the Extended Index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock exchange weakened even when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore the market balance, it began to fly deep.
Members refused to provide the funds requested by the Finance Minister Henry Paulson by 228 "no" votes against 205 "yes".
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans voted in favor of the plan.
“The market has filtered out bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"It also shows how much the market was expecting this plan," he added, then expressed his concern that if a few days later such a plan were to be adopted, it would be "too late".
“If the plan is really condemned to death (...), then it will be up to the Fed (the central bank of America) and the other central banks to deal with the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt” in the United States.
After Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia’s banking businesses were bought by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly escalated, requiring emergency measures to save banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market “has developed not only an American crisis, but also a global crisis,” adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market is booming.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be expelled from the duel as a winner.
Surprisingly, both the Republican and Democratic campaign leaders claimed victory in the television duel that a third of U.S. households were watching.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain’s performance was honorable, it did not prove to be “impressive” enough to stop his popularity from falling, according to surveys conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
According to a survey conducted by CBS, 39% of those polled will win, while 25% of those polled will expect McCain to win.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partymate Joseph Biden's promising Thursday performance, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
You have good instincts."
McCain, who was in his 70s, never fails to put his own, unquestionably huge foreign policy experience to the fore, but stresses his opponent's "naivation" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that," the attack said on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to hold the presidency,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform, which has also been exploited by the Republican TV commercials that have been running since yesterday.
However, Obama emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he summed up and put it straight.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does," Obama said in a televised Democratic ad that said the Republican leader had not yet assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "people on the street."
“In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who met in the rain in North Carolina.
Even the words "middle class" or "workers" have not even been uttered in his mouth. The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favours Obama, whom the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next seven may prove to be a turning point," said Charles Schumer, an influential Democratic senator.
Democratic MP Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama “has such excellent instincts in the economy as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.”
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict on the eight-year-long bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois Senator once again confirmed that, despite stock market fluctuations, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the creation of a country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as the development of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues of the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice there was an election?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opposition protesters protested on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words: "Dictator, resign!"
Some people admit that they haven’t even gone to vote: “Why would I go? They’re going to do what they want with my vote anyway!” says a young man.
Protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to show itself well before foreign observers in order to establish relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were clear to the observers, they would be able to lift the sanctions imposed on the country, with 40 Belarusian leaders denied visas and some bank accounts frozen.
The opposition said the elections were not clear.
“We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the polling,” said Yuri Potoemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces Coalition, organized from the twelve parties.
"The changes were only nominal," said Aleksandr Milinkievics, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition enter Parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to have a place on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore play a role in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
If our heavily indebted economy is in a crisis and we are not able to renew it, we run the risk of falling under Russia’s control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the outcome of the vote will be approved by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the election process.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high, and the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of the voters in Minsk took part) provided an opportunity for any manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there was an election?" asks Social Democratic leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released from prison last August with his second, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
A maximum of five members of the opposition will be admitted to the parliament, those who are best suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night will return to October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee will be delighted.
The blood is safe again.
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary of its foundation. President Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world today.
And most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of people, which was severely shaken by the blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the Canadian Red Cross Blood Supply Service treated nationwide blood reserves infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general upheaval, the Canadian government launched a formal investigation in February 1994 led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to formulate proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever was delayed in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own commission to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood-supply services were established in Canada: the Héma Québec, which serves Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Supply Company, which is responsible for the supply of blood to all the other provinces and the two territories.
“When Héma-Québec began its activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” said Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
“In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we have managed to regain the trust of people,” Décary says proudly, according to the report, as early as 2008, nearly 94% of the population in Quebec believed that Héma-Québece was reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “trust is a very fragile thing.”
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe where people have also been infected with a new variant of the disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob, a doctor who has been in charge of the company since its foundation in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are insecure and at risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes a change in the brain, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999 we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was decided beyond any doubt that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies against the virus, on which previous tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to a period of less than one week.
Thus, the risk of blood donors infecting blood without knowing it and of not being able to detect it was significantly mitigated.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to 1.
“In other words, we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 and 500 thousand blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that now anyone can safely accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health, says Héma-Québec’s number one leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what kind of new pathogen will be introduced into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with an insect bite.
Therefore, we must be constantly on guard," said Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, demand is also increasing.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also affects the population of blood donors, as the number of people able to donate blood in the network is only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, any healthy person, at least 18 years of age, who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is devastating are not eligible for a year to donate blood.
“We have 3 percent of our reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we run out of stocks.
However, the number of blood donors must be increased to the extent that existing ones age, because after a while they can no longer give blood.
But it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today’s busy world, one hour of man’s time is scarce enough to go and give blood,” says Francine Décary.
The Héma Québec, which operates from a $297 million annual budget, not only provides blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeball tissues and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages Quebec’s only public stem cell bank.
Once treated only as medical waste, umbilical cords can produce blood that is rich in stem cells, allowing for the treatment of serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we had the thousandth umbilical cord blood sample in our bank, and we are planning to take out more than a thousand new samples a year.
“At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering these for organ transplants,” said Dr. Décary, who believes that the umbilical cord blood extraction program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are saddened by the fact that they don’t have the opportunity to do so” – indeed, this is because Héma-Québec has no way of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football in the semi-final of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders in the USL-1 qualifiers by 3:1 yesterday, and reached the semi-finals with a combined 4:3 result. This was the second round of the quarter-finals and a decisive match in terms of the results, which took place at the Saputo stadium.
The final goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half ended without a goal, in the second half, two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, found themselves in the enemy’s net.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders team managed to play Matt Jordan goalkeeper.
Recall that in his first match on Friday, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays with Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder's team, which lost to Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but Whitecaps reached the semifinals with a combined result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still being clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadiens’ favorite triad is ready for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and eventually the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 ratio of penalty shots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the match with two goals and Kovalev finished the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
"It's gonna take another game to make me feel really good."
“He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third,” said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the end result of the game was happy.
He had a huge ovation.”
Charest's northern aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Not long after the Liberal Party meeting was over, Jean Charest traveled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is heading for a victory in the interim election to be held today.
"Retract our last great northern border": Jean Charest set out this ambitious long-term goal at the meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but the president also tried to focus on the essence.
During her performance, pictures similar to "Moulin <0xC3><0xA0> images" were shown behind her back.
The three giant projectors were followed by stunning footage: dams from hydropower plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular devices are used during election times.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's vision for the future of Quebec, embodied in a "new economic area" that includes a labor pact with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and several agreements planned with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the area starting at latitude 49) has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
The head of state, however, was confined to explaining why he considered the North to be a treasure mine full of enormous opportunities, but he did not talk about time, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
He highlighted only a few possibilities for development: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of emerging countries and the rebuilding of state infrastructures.
"Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is "our territory, the territory of Quebec."
It is not just within us, but within us,” the head of state repeated, emphasizing that this would create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is our future," he added, after taking a stage break, he took a look at the huge map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we also need to rethink our view of the North,” the Prime Minister said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the area is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec will pay special attention to them and that the plan will bring a lot of benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate of the Hungarian party Québécois) have already started negotiations with about thirty local communities.
The Interministerial Committee led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier has also begun its work, in which Julie Boulet (Minister of Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister said.
Jean Charest described this vision as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new growth and development opportunities from challenges.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that started with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party presidents.
One of the adopted decisions proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be transhipped into a barrier called Adélard-Godbout.
“The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québece, Lesage, who implemented the silent revolution and the nationwide dissemination of hydroelectric power plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963, also quoted another true, conservative work, “Roads to the North”.
In connection with the plan for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, President Charest highlighted that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and he received his statement in a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who even said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, as he undertook tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the summit of Quebec-New York.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express the nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without any thought. Here it is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party demands, in particular, the recognition of "the peculiarity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was sceptical about the main points of the Northern Plan.
Paulina Marois, the leader of the Parti Québécois, re-emphasised the Northern Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would have kept it much ahead today," said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Mrs Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure, who was the candidate for the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's approval of the Northern Plan.
“But we want this not to be a mere act,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Dishonest Country
Vic Toews, Harper's Cabinet Minister (also known as "Justice Minister"), took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt "Shameful" Canada.
To dishonor a woman who has always fought for the truth and deserves all of our admiration - this tells us a lot about the people around the prime minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which, in some of the Western countries concerned, did not transport its own nationals home from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he had committed.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and has allowed a child soldier to be subjected to inhumane conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet theatre out of justice while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian attorneys’ association are demanding that Omar Khadr be returned to Canada to receive a fair trial.
And our government is blind to the torturing: it does not matter to him that a young adult has already been spiritually destroyed, and the many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this yet, but at the moment there is an insidious destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper constantly speaks this word, which from his mouth sounds like an empty speech.
The time has come when morals no longer exist: they can arbitrarily beat, torture, and imprison any Canadian citizen in accordance with the will of a government leader who has been a minority so far (and what can come after October 14?).
Many electors believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law, and Order. They do not see that this government is trampling upon the values to which our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, shame is more like this - don't look anywhere else.

In Le Devoir's September 17 issue, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, vice president and chief executive of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
As a result of Orwelli’s discussion, Garver states that the world’s largest gold-producing company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation lawsuits, is not based on the truth, but on the law.
It is not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend significant amounts of money on defense and combat in an unequal fight where on the other hand there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources in the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, however, the tactics of destroying the defendant and making a friendly agreement are often used, not only to silence the opposite, but even to intimidate those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he would have had to explain his views to the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually do not hit each other with a stick, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying independent research teams to shed light on the issue.
But it seems Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public, and with one move, he's sweeping away requests and letters written to protect Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he disregards the opinion of this public?
In the head of the vice-president, this word probably means only the lawyers who have been paid for the busily, rather than the whole population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even those who abuse others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand – or does not want to understand – that Noir Canada’s authors and publishers are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh method of mining.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a case of silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surreal reflections, Barrick Gold’s procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources, to debate facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to reply.
In our university community, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's unthinkable procedure shows that, contrary to his claim, he had no desire to argue.
This is a loss both for the world of universities and for the Canadian public debate institution. It is time for governments to implement measures that limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
Yesterday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement on the economic rescue operation, which has been the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months is yet to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The essential elements of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the envisaged public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses reserved for failure to pay; right of access to the remuneration of managers of the companies benefiting from assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, the Republican MP at the trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial was over.
“We have made a big step forward towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
“We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, there will be a huge shock, chaos, and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” Republican MEP Judd Gregg said.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
The deal was granted a deadline until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed a willingness to reach an agreement, however, they expressed that they were not happy that the situation had intensified to the very end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with extending the agreement to include elements such as provisions on the preservation of house ownership or the payment of government-assisted directors.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, it is not very welcome.
“These steps are necessary,” he said on a television show in the United States.
When his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I have read in large lines can be seen from the fact that it is something that we all have to digest and through which we can move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions, some of their unsold, risky assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the collapse of the real estate mortgage. This first resulted in the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt securities (trade) and finally caused the freezing of liquid assets and the expansion of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft deal was dropped by a group of Republicans last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this deadlock since the Democrats agreed to secure some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, rather than buy them.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which stipulates that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its funds.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion tranche would be paid out first, followed by an additional $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress with another vote.
In return for the aid, Washington acquires a stake in the subsidised companies, which will give it a dividend on profits and which it can sell after the crisis has stalled.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set the maximum value of the wage and the final severance payable to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the House to vote on the plan today and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, statements against the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington will not hear your voice," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, said in a statement.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that would benefit the taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic leader of a small congressional group called the “Sceptic faction,” presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred outstanding economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, have written to us to ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine which path it chooses,” Sherman said.
In Europe, at the same moment, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
After a crisis conference, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize a portion of the Fortis banking group at a value of €11.2 billion (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its bankruptcy competitor after losing EUR 2 million (US$ 2.9 billion) as a result of the US secondary mortgage crisis.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not money thrown away," Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we get the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly something that depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the La Manche, the British government appears to be preparing to nationalise another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total amount of ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US$75,5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would acquire the UK bank’s subsidiaries and customer base.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor
Beautiful azure eyes are considered by some to be his main punch card, and by others to be his main weakness.
Did the American actor with a smile ever get rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yeah, and I didn't.
Due to his shame, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also absent from him from the rascal style, which is the true monster of the art world.
But what a huge track he's been running!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at his property in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema’s heyday.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, who was a competitor on the screen for a long time. His roles were more subdued and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often comes from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure in the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which only increased his merit.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York City, before he burst into the world of theatre, television, and shortly after.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he won second place as a racing driver in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, closed, dedicated actor who hated the glamour of show-business, which will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his big roles, we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his life’s work, the seventh American art, cinema has been constantly changing for more than fifty years.
In our memory, a young man is confused by the muddy cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation "The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof".
From the late 1990s, we can remember him in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is facing old age with the fact that his marriage did not redeem his hopes.
Paul Newman has also seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's "Someone Up There" film, he played an unforgettable role as a stormy-life criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, originally intended for James Dean, and after his death, he started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Big Trouble", which won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961), he starred in a bitter, vengeful billiard player, and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money."
It's a different time, but it's always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by changes in the ages.
The younger ones are best known for George Roy Hill's "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, an ice hockey coach who works with non-standard methods.
His fans, however, could see him in the "The Great Jump" recorded by the Coen brothers in 1994.
Sam Mendes's 2003 film The Way of Condemnation was the last film to appear in the role of an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many of the movie legends who left the film screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he condemned Hollywood along with its glamour, radiance, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not, without all the humor, regard it as "a living disclaimer of underplay": he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newmann, who for a long time just fell into the lap of the film.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters: rather, he formed figures living on the fringes of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to return with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: in the depths of his soul, he was a truly meek and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film Rachel, Rachel, an adaptation of Margaret Laurence’s novel by Canadian writer Joanne Woodward, she drew a fine portrait of a melancholic woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and his Son" commemorates Scott, his son who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday, many of Newman's admirers remembered the actor, his close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (who was played together in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"), in shock, said: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: this was the secret to the vibrating individuality of this great actor whom we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his remarks about civil rights, the environment, independent film production and Hollywood's dissensions are blurred.
We often saw his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He made it with a pretty bad taste of mouth, although he thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In a letter to five of his daughters, he wrote: “Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to be able to accompany such a brilliant and generous American artist throughout his career.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
He is accused of fraud and other crimes, including falsification of documents, which cause particularly significant damage to the politician and his fellows in a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds won were used for their own purposes, and the execution of the tasks was often proved by false invoices.
The state and local government funds – totalling about 65 million forints – were partly transferred to the Young Left’s cash register, and partly to the pockets of some people.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the funds won were collected on the basis of cost accounts that were not backed by actual performance and the associations never met the commitment.
According to the indictment, most of the accounts were fake.
For these, account blocks were acquired on the market in J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros, and circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies to which the production of invoices should take place were, among other things, decided on the Balaton highlands road to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
He said he had to look at restaurants and motels.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was followed by invoices for applications submitted by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these were written by István Lados and his partner András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote mostly the reports necessary for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados's "study trips" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the catering establishment provided meals for the group of ninety people of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, as the CEO said, they would not have had access to the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, the Foundation for a Better Future – later Together for the Third Millennium – was filled with errors in form and content in the summer of 2002.
A bed and breakfast in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, but the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative print-fillers were overstated even when Pigal Kft., which also deals with hospitality, was marked, and the documents concerning the Better Future and the name of the Hoppa were not included in its accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution.
The company’s CEO, Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called in to the prosecutor’s office and presented invoices to him, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The stamp was in the wrong place with the name of our company and our tax number."
He added that besides the formal reasons, it was also not correct that the account said that 100 people had been accommodated, since they had 11 rooms in total, which do not have as many seats.
In addition, the account was also meant to be served, while their restaurant was no longer functional.
The enthusiastic account makers did not follow the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked like only organises trips abroad, so they chose to travel to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not in line with the company’s invoicing practice.
Moreover, as revealed during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was also wrong in the four documents issued by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. for the Better Future, since the company’s service is not charged by the indicated VAT of 25 percent but 15 percent, in addition, the employees of the hotel only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have corrupted the bill by marking road freight transport as an activity carried out in the case of a company, which has not been carried out by the company based on investment advice, according to the prosecutor's procedure.
In addition, due to malformations - inadequate account format, not a real stamp - it has also fallen out that the accounts of the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
As with Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza was under liquidation at the time (2001), when the group of the Young City Association was eating there, and therefore the company’s liquidator, as far as we know, denied that he would have issued the paper.
I was consciously exposed
The other group of account issuers are those who knew they had to issue a fictitious account.
The Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists for the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi Ludovic, commissioned the head of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious invoice.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with Biogate Ltd., which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlasz Association and the Red Pine Association with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million, without real economic activity behind them.
Money movement, too, because the completed accounts were then torn down, but organizations have forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice includes those that are related to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery agent for the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., which is based in Budapest and is not located there.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
Iván Kubatov, a Romanian man, was the managing director of this company, and Iván Kubatov would have forwarded the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that in the course of the investigation, Cubatov acknowledged that he had issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium on behalf of the Kft.
In particular, at the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the accused said was because they did not get a job.
However, he was of use to the companies because, at the request of his accused partner, the lawyer Szente Zsolt, who also made the company’s foundation papers, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and the Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office believed that 10 percent of the amounts shown in the accounts and the VAT hit the mark on Cubatov.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the application of the Commissioner Point.
Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a tender in January 2006 to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA).
They won 500-500 thousand forints, but the funds were not spent for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found in the search for a house in <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at his teaching wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as he did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the process of invoice production.
The most interesting thing is that the first defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to put the veil on everything.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak comprehensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in this interest, or whether the socialists have made a deal with it in exchange for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the trouble.
Anyone who may have been offended by the fact that his requests to relieve the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to put him under house arrest, were constantly found deaf ears.
While perpetrators of economic crimes that cause far greater harm and do not compensate for it can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of over-reliance: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
Neuro-economical foundations of this known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been explored by researchers from the University of New York, neurologist and economist.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to miss out on a type of competition like eBay’s auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research attempted to map the nervous system pattern of this "play" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers lotteryd, while the other group of players participated in an auction, while using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) to study the active brain areas of the subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which an important element is the over-bidder of the other side - the complex under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, entered into intense action when the game was lost.
In addition to several other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research group, economists, also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against a partner in various circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they came out of the game winning, they would receive a commission of $15 more.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that one of them emphasized the win and the other the loss.
However, proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing against "loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and "winning" groups.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of victory and the avoidance of risk.
Neurological imaging methods alone helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is cited as one of the leading causes of death.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis, but only seven thousand are treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a common name for liver infections caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, they are characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases caused by them differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the feed channel (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other viruses with blood and body fluids (thrush, vaginal discharge, saliva).
In any case, passengers should be vaccinated against A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms occur two to three weeks after eating an infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, the jaundice on the skin and on the whites of the eyes develops, the stool is light, the urine becomes dark, the healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die every year from the more severe form of the disease, hepatitis B-induced liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only 1 in 10 infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases, only after 20-30 years, the first symptoms appear.
Therefore, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular screening tests.
In three groups, the incidence of this disease is much higher than the average: between people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and the tattooed.
There are currently 200 million people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus worldwide.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth contacting your GP if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognising the disease can be cured in time, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organised in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of their development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects people’s sense of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked, while all of them studied a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university are involved.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparking device to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci’s picture of Lady with Hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a kind of religious state among the faithful, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, either looking at the religious topic or the general picture.
Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they were “careful” and “quiet, peace filled them.”
While viewing the religious image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when they saw Leonardo’s creation in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that similar effects can be achieved by any powerful image, even in atheists, only the right photo should be found.
“We should find a picture that is very positive for them, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality," Wright added.
After great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter were to show a picture of a Madonna to the faithful, what would be the effect of their pain control?
Would the view of the high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On Google’s tenth birthday, you can say that people’s pockets are at least as wide as they are above their heads in the sky; you know where they’ve been on vacation, what they’re doing and what they’re interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's main people.
As for the sceptics who are parallel to the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal information about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of Google founders, which was to “get all the information in the world in a system.”
According to Google CEO, even after ten years of world-shaping work, the company is still just beginning to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt replied: “You want Google to be able to answer questions like ‘what should I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what kind of work would be right for me?’ – but until then, software cannot answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.”
Not all internet users are aware that search words are accurately recorded in internet searches, which IP address they were searching for, and which page they left after the search.
Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users, for example, to store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and generate more personalized results for them in the long run – based on the same logic that Recommendations will use to offer products and services to us based on our previously stated and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? – asked users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power, trigger counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but can also be transferred to third parties in justified cases, in such cases there is no protection of the privacy rights of internet users.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was a concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on pedophiles from the social media site Orkut, which it maintains.
However, Internet users worried about privacy rights may have suffocated in May when the company, in conjunction with the EFF electronic rights protection organization, successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI: Google cannot be forced to disclose any information that the FBI has secretly asked for.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which were obtained by referring to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act that had been passed years ago, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and to obtain a full two-month website and keyword list.)
Google’s view is therefore quite controversial: it is being ridiculed by those who keep their personal data from being provided because they feel their privacy and privacy is being undermined by the fact that they start using Google’s services and are being attacked by a revolt against multi-company companies that are appearing in conservative imik.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists, and users from many countries sees the next generation of big companies, the “smart corporation” in them, unlike its rival, Microsoft, which is a world-conquerer for Windows, no matter how much they fight for the same goal.
This could happen because Google does not ask for an ID code from its users, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, continuously updated source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, and cooler than official software giant practice.
However, it can also happen that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which is exactly one of the most frequently voiced keywords of recent years, the web 2.0 followed.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving traces behind and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while these vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xanga, linked to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his music habits, and then link them all to follow-up systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also run a blog that automatically displays the latest photo galleries on Frlick or Frlick.
While there are a number of exemplary cases that reveal it: the girlfriend easily discovers the morning photo of a group of friends that she has spent the evening with or that she can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on top management in her blog: a sure, the concept of privacy has been completely revalued by now.
Anyone who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, which is the basic principle behind the behavior of today’s young people.
And if you want to hide something or at least avoid Google Monopoly, you can do it (start with Scroogle, for example, using Google’s search engine but not intentionally leaving a trace).
For example, there are few people who don’t want to sign up for social networking sites to avoid being found, Google’s online applications can be replaced by alternative versions from word processor to image manager and newsreader that don’t connect to huge server parks and that don’t create the best profile we’ve ever had.
The public doesn’t expect to be so secret when Google reveals the protein in their teeth.
With the company’s current $156 billion worth, it’s worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten revenue from advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an accelerating pace cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical contemporaries also find counter-points that are disturbing: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of the employees after doubling the price of the company’s kindergarten, the management found it too expensive to feed the employees on a daily basis, but it all fades away from the fact that Google is still running a good deal in 2006
One of the company’s internal rules sounds like they don’t pre-publish a new service, only when it’s already in use with the health care system itself, but for sure, the obvious problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project takes on such a scale that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good source for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, Scroogled Point Orwelli, describes the future in which a person can approach only alarmingly well from Google data.
Two juveniles helped the double murderer of Ozd in the persecution
Police questioned two juveniles about the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, suspected of assisting in the disappearance of the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the police headquarters in Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Young people have admitted the act they were charged with, and are currently accused of prosecuting crime.
The two young people, according to the MTI, are on the loose.
Penalty can be punished by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He is suspected of a planned, profit-seeking crime of murder of several people.
The investigation revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to a location in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed him and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime in advance, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the conditions of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech crowns - for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously ruled out by the Czechs as a potential new owner of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 is new to know that the offer of the Poles represents the highest amount that has so far been offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Stock Exchange have so far submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroons.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
From the perspective of European newspapers on the financial crisis
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers are already talking about "second September 11".
The global financial disaster is due to the US President, accused by La Repubblica of Rome, who was not even able to line up his own party behind the bill that was set up in the wound to remedy the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but the Congressional vote threatened Washington not to offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still provide a lifeline to the struggling financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor the new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national selfishness and to centralise control of fragmented financial markets.
Only Monday, more than €100 billion was received by infirm financial institutions, according to the Vienna Der Standard, the concerns that, like Americans, European taxpayers also have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which sweeps the old continent as a tsunami.
Rescuers don’t have to start throwing hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good to fix it: in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
The flight of the dongo is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not to imitate obstacle sensors in the natural world?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, dongo bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C, a robotic mini-car with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, each bee develops its own oval-shaped personal space, which in fact is very similar to our safety case, said Kazuhiro Doi, Director of PR and R&D Technology at the exhibition.
It is important to play a role in the complex eyes of the uterus, which can see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To replicate the complex eye function, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser telemeter.
This identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid collision.
During a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and the autorobot immediately changes direction by rotating its wheels to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, the auto-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
It should respond in an intuitive and immediate manner, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety cover, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility for bees to bypass other bees, only the rotating movement and acceleration as well as the deceleration were used as an option for the autorobot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, an instinctive intelligent reaction is the ability to process, not to process, even less store data.
This structure only needs to process and react to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory at all times.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate bypass technology, which, according to Nissan’s estimate, could enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
An additional application option may be to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to avoid obstacles on the road leading the car to the specified end goal.
It's also the name of the venomous child.
A written version of the multi-detailed $700 billion economic bailout law to buy banks' bad loans has been prepared.
In the first instance, half of the money is spent.
According to the Eastern Coastal Times, during the new talks that took place after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders were at a standstill in the debate over the $700 billion bailout package that has been going on for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme would work and be effective, but that further work was needed. Pelosi said it was not about saving Wall Street, but about reversing the economy’s chariot.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening 8 (that is, Central European time at 2:00 a.m.) but did not cause a spectacular upswing on the stock exchange.
The draft Act on the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act 2008 will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday for the first time and will be held in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokeswoman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
By the way, the program is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which would have said that $700 billion would have been spent on buying low-quality, loan-backed securities.
In the first round, a maximum of half of the 700 billion can be spent by spending 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will buy bad-ranked securities with a credit background, and the fate of another 100 billion will depend on the decision of the president.
The program will be overseen by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of 700 billion will depend on another Congressional resolution.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combination of tactics: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of “toxic” loans.
The purchase can be made in auctions and directly, the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law would provide the necessary tools to reach up to $700 billion in urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s buying out a wide range of bad assets or securing them, or avoiding the systemic risk of a collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
On the other hand, the bosses of banks in distress and in need of state aid can expect their withdrawal money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are restricted only in certain cases, moreover, the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if you buy the Ministry in the framework of an auction, you will be extra taxed on the gold parachute unless you retire the Levite bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
The picture also shows that the existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones, so as to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can ultimately win on the transaction once the economy and the bank that has been rescued recovers.
The bill states that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a motion to Congress on how to return the expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayers’ dollars, the California Republican Issa Darrell said.
His Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures had been advocated by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have increased further
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 percent in August 2007, reports the KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than in the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8%), mainly due to the 4.6% increase in the price of bags, belts and footwear production and the 2.5% monthly increase in the price of footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
There was a price drop in oil processing (1.4%), electrical machinery, instrument manufacturing (0.9%) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured price growth between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, increased by 0.3 percent, mainly as a result of the protracted impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing sectors, prices in the petroleum processing sector increased most (32.4%).
The production of metal processing products in the sector has seen an increase of 13.2 per cent in prices in the food, beverage and tobacco production, which are the most important weight.
Price reductions occurred in the manufacturing of textiles, textile goods (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 percent in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7 per cent higher than one year earlier.
In August, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 %) in the investment goods manufacturing sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, and in the energy and re-use sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent and a 1.4 per cent decrease in the price of investment goods.
The export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro in one month, by 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, by 7.5 percent compared to the euro in August 2007, and by 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Do you need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force around 12 January – the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "everything now depends on whether the electronic access control system is being built up overseas in time".
He pointed out, however, that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington, D.C.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Middle Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will award and hold talks with the Star with Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are on the side of the bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidate of the two major US parties, backed the government’s $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After several days of marathon negotiations, Congress and the administration announced at dawn on Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at defrosting the frozen credit market have become central to the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain have also said that they are more capable than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, a meltdown of McCain's advantage, which he obtained after the Republican convention, with the nomination of Vice President Sarah Palin.
At a rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passports, which he also supported.
"We need to act now, with responsibility (...) your job, your savings, the whole industry, the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said.
He did not miss calling McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all find it difficult to swallow this (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way to go.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal included setting up a committee to oversee the Finance Minister and limiting the final satisfaction of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the talks, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
View of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the electorate became more self-aware – this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution, analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled Fathers and Fathers.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The era change is also the problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to CSU, but on Sunday a process was over, which was almost exactly ten years ago likely: the undisputed hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For ten years, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, first below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say, in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the CSU’s consistently implemented modernization in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the same time. However, the loyalty of the electorate to CSU could not be without consequences for the secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences can be seen.
The right-wing camp was untouched, only within the camp did the electorate become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, classical civic groups have been the most distant from CSU; those with free occupations, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
CSU support has shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In the article "Who, with whom? The party presidents deal with the confused domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96>’s interference in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to negotiate on the coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, party leaders hardly allowed access to their cards.
Werner Faymann, SP<0xC3><0x96> President, has confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as well as the Vice-Chancellor - could be imagined - was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
Repeating this direction is not the case.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party elects the opposition or enters the coalition, it is completely open to the party for the time being, the issues must necessarily be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> was once again open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka: Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities was launched in Paris, and this year France, representing the rotating Presidency of the European Union, is hosting it.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, the Fidesz representative of the European People’s Party, called attention to education segregation in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional meeting, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacles to their enforcement.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly due to their low level of education.
“The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality primary education, only a minor part of them can obtain tertiary education.”
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can help strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the rapporteur, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest possible way - even between Roma and non-Roma.
Because as early as possible, Roma students will start school, thus increasing their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market; they will contribute to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
“Roma must ensure that they have the right to quality education under the right to EU citizenship and ensure that their low-quality and segregated education is abolished,” said L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
The rapporteur believes that the European Union's objective and action-oriented cooperation is necessary in order to speed up the process of desecration in schools immediately, for which the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities for All, which has been held annually since last year’s Berlin meeting, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
The fate of the downed Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the terrible election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the personal issues have been discussed at the summits of the Bavarian CSU for the time being.
Erwin Huber and Governor G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein may still remain in place, a question of how long the grace will last.
The fate of the 17 percent catastrophic vote-losing tandem will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized couple felt that they did not hold on to their chairs with all their strength.
They sought to appease the angry members of the faction and base, who demanded personal conquistadors one day after the "bajor tsunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it only ran to 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU has been the sole ruler of Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count highly in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will certainly be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the reorganization within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, who is the potential successor of Huber, will also be given a seat in the narrow reconnaissance team, which will start negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors organized along the lines of right-wing values on a possible coalition of government in Munich.
The strange find of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a pair of coups, gets into the legislature on the list of Free Electors, and then is ruthlessly treated by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president, will also play an active role in the transition, calling September 28 the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber released a few snippets of comments to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is somehow put back on track.
Merkel, who is hard to hide because of the fiasco, said that the loss of CSU soil will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
What is relative, of course, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the social democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria by 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No member of the opposition has entered the Belarusian parliament in the wake of the election on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability provided in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegality of counting votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million people has been without the opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), was seriously hoping that the constitutional amendment would lead to Lukashenko’s fourth-time renewal of the presidential mandate in the 2006 elections.
The ODSZ also withdrew from the pre-considered boycott.
Against the background of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia for economic reasons, has taken credit for reducing the ever-expanding Russian natural gas imports and has also contributed to the Russian handing over of Beltransgaz, the country’s transit gas pipelines, to improve its relations with the EU, which is considered anti-democratic due to the high-ranking Belarusian political order.
It was a relief that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused on positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from starting out.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
However, according to the opposition, there has been a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which have separated from Georgia, even though Russia - with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper - has been independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the power was frightened by the fact that it would allow even one of its opponents to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest actions in view of the results, but instead tries to send a message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles in the way of distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, including among the elderly," Milinkevich said, referring to Lukashenko's regime, which considers social security to be its main achievement, not even the most officially supported pensioner category.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness, the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time to break up the social security that cites the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevics said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebezev, the head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi: “People believe not in words, but in actions,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Regrets only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotating doors were installed for the entry and exit of workers.
As of today, this new measure will come into effect against the bartenders, to filter out those who block and then go out for a coffee at work.
The anti-snap news was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office.
"The rotary gates," said Brunetta, "are used to improve and improve work, reduce gaps and increase services."
“There is a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
"We have not seen any resistance from the employees," the secretary-general said, "the workers have approved the measure, everyone has cooperated."
In a word, breakfast is over during work hours, no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta smilingly advises: "A good little capuccino at 7 a.m., can do miracles"
The Roman College of Public Administration
At the meeting, the minister said: “In three months, public sector workers’ absences due to illness have decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more employees in one year.”
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
According to the Minister, “the wage dynamics of the past 8-10 years have been twice as high as those of the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered, joining the petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations, to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Public Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of disease-related deficiencies, the war on 'untired nappers' continues to grow," the Consumer Protection Association said in a statement.
Italy has gathered thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff across Italy to declare war on the illegal provisions of the regulation."
The Regional Administrative Court is challenged, inter alia, by the abolition of supplementary sickness allowance for sickness attributable to service reasons, the extension of the period of stay of sick leave workers at home, which means the period during which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important
In Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur every day, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company at work, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, and almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmil is hosting the 58th anniversary of the victims of workplace accidents traditionally held on the second Sunday of October in every Italian county, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, show that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work,” said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, Pietro Mercandelli, in a message sent to the President of the National Association of Workers’ Accidents.
The Head of State sincerely praised the association's persistent commitment to prevention at work, protecting the interests of workers affected by the accident, helping the family members of the victims and making the public vulnerable.
“Naturally and honestly distributed by everyone, this kind of tragedy, which is also of interest to the media and the public, is causing an outrage, but in reality we have to face dramatic cases every day that are repeated over and over again.”
Napolitano openly admits that "we are undoubtedly struggling with a lack of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at direct awareness of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be drawn to the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the House of Commons, said: “How serious are the fatal accidents at work, which are of social importance to all of us, and require the institutions to put an end to them as soon as possible.”
“Data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still remarkably high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
At the same time, we do not want this downward trend to be accompanied by diminishing attention, because the greatest tragedies are occurring when attention is reduced.”
"We believe that we are still not doing everything we can to overcome this phenomenon at a general level, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
We believe that stricter supervision and control is needed, Mercandelli stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of labour market training, starting with school education."
"More efforts are also needed to inform the public and make them more receptive," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in contrast to a phenomenon that poses a problem at a social level."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and the "assistance trend towards which the system is drifting in recent years".
“The aim is therefore to give back to workers the security of insurance, because the fate of those affected cannot depend on the arbitrary and dispensing measures of the legislators.”
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
It can cause permanent hearing loss by listening to portable player devices for longer and at high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In a report published in Brussels, the European Commission, based on the opinion published today by the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"It turns out that 5 to 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour per day for five years may suffer permanent hearing loss," the statement said.
“It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” Meglena Kuneva said.
"Scientific surveys represent an indisputable risk that we urgently need to respond to," the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on this widely.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function properly and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the proliferation of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine possible measures to protect children and adolescents exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," said a member of the committee.
The current European safety standard defines the maximum noise level that portable music players can emit in 100 dB, but there is growing concern about the hearing loss caused by the excessive use of such sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise exposure, which can significantly reduce the hearing loss.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for users of portable players who listen to music for five hours a week at a high volume (more than 89 decibels), noise exposure exceeds the current maximum value for noise at work.
If a person listens to music for a longer period of time under similar conditions, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This affects about 5-10 percent of users of the portable device, which can reach 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs until March, the results are expected in June.
This agenda was set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the "The future of Rome's capital" committee, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out Rome’s guidelines.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated at the General Assembly and the municipal committee to submit the strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented," Alemanno stressed, "and it is the task of the Commission to develop proposals for the development of Rome that can be relied upon by political decision-makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Committee on Local Government.
There is no question of any conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed term of office.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the committee "The Future of Rome", the Mayor said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, arguing that the expertise it has drawn up is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will make on the table.
If the standard is satisfactory, as is the case with the Attali Commission in France, which I am certain of in the case of Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in day-to-day affairs and in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further and plan for the longer term and are committed to the development and future of Rome.”
The Mayor of Rome wishes to state that “this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless ‘waterhead’, because it is completely free, it will not cost a single euro to Roman citizens, but it will serve as a thought-incentive and aim to involve the best minds in the capital.”
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will enable our city to jump to the standard it so desperately needs, thinking in a unified spirit about its future.”
Regarding the future on which the Mayor of Rome stresses: “It will not only be confined to the current municipal framework, but will look much further away”, we see not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as capital, and must play.”
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, claiming to be independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to destroy the American economy with his decisions and maintain close ties (as he does today as a private individual) with enemy Islam.
As the election time approaches, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: “This man is full of ambition.
Obama thinks he can win the highest public dignity of a nation whose two governors and five senators have been black so far."
These attacks are actually meaningless; of course, they are racist in nature, but they do not answer the voters’ question of whether he will be a good president. Then here are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant advantage.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
Inside the Southern States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial: “We know well that in the ballot box, the true American patriot casts his vote on whom.”
Here is a side of the American way of thinking that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk about what you want, and we'll know where to put the twins, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been uttered until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these speculations, the Democrats’ winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush’s term of office? 89% said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 troops in Vietnam, and was slanted by flying to its home country.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans didn’t have to pack.
The majority still believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak spot.
There is a huge task waiting for George W. to take his place.
U.S.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time of austerity has come in the editorial offices, and many blame the Internet for the “death” of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 U.S. journalists how they felt about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Now, almost all journalists are pessimists about their own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that they would have reduced their concern about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem with American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is a failure of a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsroom, i.e. editorial editors making newspapers.
If we don’t want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum in the sense that the public understands it, this problem must be solved, the journalists said.
Today, American journalism is characterized by visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press staff to see where the world web is going.
The biggest publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which is believed by many to be the "killer" of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted to voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, there is a gap in the U.S. press industry between editorial leaders, i.e. directors, and reporters working for them.
At the national level, 56% of executives are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, while at the local level, this figure is only 23%.
Some people associate this with a safe job.
At the national level, 47 percent of managers fear they may lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this percentage is 30%.
In America, the question of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at the team level (for our editors, ed.).
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
With a huge nation like the United States with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a “need or not” basis.
Directors are usually paid a high salary, and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, in the third, too, until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own testimony, often “be sick” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF JUSTICE: DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTAFERRATABA MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Rome Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who was active in the real estate business, who wanted to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for economic failure in the context of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL Share Exchange Agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate specialist pass through the rural small town to his home in the capital.
However, according to the court, these incidents (which the prosecutor made a negative proposal for) would allow the company’s affairs to be affected and to have access to evidence against it.
The Elite in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion bailout bill presented by the White House: the majority of Americans were more interested in and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which reports that the current crisis has led to a break-up within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing division between the traditional, restrained, supportive Eastern Coastal approach to federal institutions and business circles and the ever-growing new anti-Washington and financial world trend in the central and southern states.
This approach was expressed in a critical way in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still taking place is forecasting or allowing to be seen, not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and Europe, will only speed up the phenomena that have been in place for a long time, which will be consolidated in this new atmosphere and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-activation, the re-establishment of a dual category of state sovereignty in the public consciousness of a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions which, while maintaining close links with foreign countries, are primarily and fairly widespread, bringing with them people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, in turn, is a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those who are also electors.
So the economic crisis seems global, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to have essentially been lashed outside the coastline: the eloquent proof of this is the European Union, which is unable to define a single political line between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the opening of new rules, but most of all the funds: because in a difficult situation, only individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that can make things right.
They also have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that will probably never be possessed by any other market or international organisation to that extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation-state is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we just had to realize that our future increasingly depends on things that are not abstract like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, but are wholly connected to a demarcated place, to an area.
So whoever controls the area has much more percussion cards than he who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
This would also translate to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fracture line.
Whoever says territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis appears to have produced two contiguous phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, for those who can take control of events.
On the other hand, current leadership, in particular economic leaders, is leading to a total loss of credit, who have proved to be completely inadequate and have proven that much is yet to be obscured.
Together, the two are even more profound and, in a sense, more disturbing: a feeling of credit loss, impatience, incompetence and separation that affects the entire elite of leaders in an increasing number of Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the belief that the time of the social elite, which has reached its peak, has come to an end in an ever-increasing number of people seems to be growing. It has passed before they had their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, taken over by the social elite, which is becoming increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, is fueling a diverse but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and against the traditional political system of the United States. This is reflected in the unanticipated “disruptions” of voters or, in recent times, in sudden changes in public moods. For example, the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties and programs, and even with its habits, its press and its renowned intellect, is becoming less and less able to represent what has been going on for some time in the deeper strata of Western society.
To be honest, it would be an exaggeration to talk about "the impending rebellion of the masses."
But it doesn't hurt to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk with super strong glue on the wall
With the help of a super-strong glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall as Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With just 2.5 square centimeters of glue, the researchers managed to glue and hold a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
The American journal TANULM<0xC3><0x81>NY - A Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientific group was born from the further development of previously existing special, so-called carbon nanotube-structured materials.
“The principle of adhesive operation must be conceived as a package of pipe systems similar to spaghetti,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the covered foot of the Gecko microscopic shutters, which provides perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the feet of the said reptiles, while “it’s easy to separate it from the wall,” says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering Department.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe yes, but researchers prefer to think of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can also find other applications in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a hair-like, microfiber adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning while moving through the surface, so it always provides perfect adhesion.
Medications? Fruits are forbidden!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially popular in the summer, when taken with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption, as appropriate, by amplifying or reducing their effect. This can also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, London, said at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thereby preventing their beneficial effect and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has already been placed on the stand of the defendants before, when it turned out that it is able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, heart rhythm control and nerve medication to levels considered toxic.
Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in an official press release, warning doctors and patients to take the risks of this combination seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to the researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active substances whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be long-listed.
Michele Carruba, a professor at the Department of Pharmacy at the State University of Milan, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately signaled to various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the prospectus of the particular drug is changed.
That’s why you should always read the package leaflet of the medicine you’re going to take, and if something isn’t understandable, don’t let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly,” Ansa said.
Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the regional relationships between commercial models and economic activity.
55-year-old Neo-Keenesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman, in a editorial published in the New York Times, predicted that the latter event would have even more disastrous consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast sparked little debate, and it was often thrown into the eyes of the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little shocked at how quickly public interest has gone beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said in a statement at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “really valuable economist” but at the same time “spreads his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration in a rather aggressive style.”
Open Office, the third edition of the "Anti-Microsoft" package is also worth it
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 comes with an open program code application package that increases personal productivity, targeting more and more layers, from home to office users, from freelancers to public administrations, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work with SUN Microsystems and volunteer developers, the new Open Office brings more new features to the public: in addition to the welcome screen and the rethought, less Spartan user interface, it offers more essential new features, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format 1.2).
Special attention has been paid to the compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Another interesting feature is the specific feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphic module by keeping the page layout.
The same interface allows you to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editing elements.
Sharing within apps has also gone through a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports the shared use of workbooks, but prevents each other from overwriting their work. Each employee’s comment is marked in a different color, which helps easier recognition in the control phase.
Some companies are already working to make some features of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, having been added to the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
On request, you can take over the installation CD at home or at work.
Freeware is likely to be the biggest attraction for the spread of the home application, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as you can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of education, consultancy and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, Excel replacement spreadsheet; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. However, if you consider that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is positive, it's the fourth doping case.
On the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl from Austria, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team, again produced a positive pattern, and won the best mountaineering jersey in addition to the bronze medal.
The news came to light on Equipe’s website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer after Italian Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test, which was considered the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, similar to the tests performed in recent weeks, has been studied by laboratories in Lausanne and chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, Austria will lose its third place and, according to the regulations, will be banned from racing for two years.
The news about the positive results of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press reported to the news agency that the positive doping results had been communicated to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and also won the best mountaineer polo shirt.
ARE THE NEW YORK TIMES SUBJECT TO THE QUESTION, THE RUSSIA OF ITALY?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of immigrants to one of the most popular destinations for reluctant immigrants.
The New York Times, based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the “northern paradox”: in the northern regions the “strongest is integration and the highest is employment” while the “anti-immigrant and support of the Northern League” is the strongest in the country.
To support the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the grass against immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, were also presented as an example of a mood change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also highlight this trend: “Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students suffering from expensive rental fees can cost up to 900 euros in a room
The market for student accommodation is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Tenants’ Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"Today, the phenomenon has reached such incredible proportions that, because of the enormous total cost to families, it has shut down a wide range of students from the opportunity to learn," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of growth has begun with local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no restrictions on rent, linked to a lease.
According to Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed to enable prices to be maximised through the revision of the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, 450 euros are requested for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (Bande Nere area) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can reach 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most students live near the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros when it comes to double rooms and 370-500 euros when it comes to single rooms.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single bed and 450 for a double bed.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros for a single room) prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You can save some in the suburban districts: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are requested for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price is highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you will have to pay 250/350 euros for a single bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the urban budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema rooms in the cities has come to a close
Traditional cinemas are closed for the benefit of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore show effectively what is happening in the Italian cities, but also in the rural regions.
Expropriation of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the disappearance of single-room cinemas in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend goes away, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says Cinema Paradiso director. The film, which was an Oscar award twenty years ago and a grand prize for the Cannes festival, tells the story of the lyrics of a small-town cinema that may have been lost after a movie.
The data provided by the largest association of operators, Anec, is clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest loss was recorded by cinemas in major cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is among the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the proliferation of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance is no more than the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. “It’s okay to build new facilities, but the survival of those that already exist should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not every one of them is willing to go into multiplexes.
Not to mention unfilled financial funds intended to support operators: the government’s overdue debt can be set at around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market, it would take EUR 16-18 million a year."
This is the first Italian city to decide, in its concerns over closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost the single-room cinemas outside and downtown.
The provisions would include tax advantages for operators and benefits for the public in order to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted areas and park in certain parking lots at a reduced rate.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the domination of multiplex, need to improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: closing the Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso, even though I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale so as not to see the posters blacked out of the dust, I turn my head around.
Close links between politics and 'ndrangheta, Mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested
“Gioia Tauro’s mayor supported the interests of the Piromila clan in municipal decisions.”
Serious charges have been filed against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning on charges of taking part in a criminal association.
Gioacchino Piromila, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as a lawyer with the same name as the boss, was also handcuffed to a nephew who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal association and was fined EUR 10 million.
"The disregard of all legal and moral rules, what is more to good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to Piromodel's lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially had access to the town hall, which would have given it additional control and control over the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide the fact that there is "a lot of collusion between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, a number of local politicians resist the pressure of the ‘ndrangheta’, they are the heroes who remain clean.”
The arrests this morning are a continuation of what happened in July, when the police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Piromalma clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were acquitted of their mandate to administer the local government. Gioia Tauro’s municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even after the alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor of the dissolution period, was the leader of the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He shouted scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He brought former Interior Minister Marco Minnin to court and accused him of plotting everything with a political aim, but the court said in an arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalma clan had ventured to demand a change in the A3 project.
The hearing ordered against Dal Torrion, state prosecutors say, "it was desirable to comply with the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who were known to be close to the Piromalma family, to subjugate the municipal decisions to the clan interest."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible source of energy, which accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface, and which is still being discovered by large international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, and renewable energy sources that giants like Chevron have been eyeing, trying to put their hands on.
For hundreds of years, they have been looking for ways to generate energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices are giving the industry a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore installations.
This is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolution when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have been committed supporters of traditional energy so far.
“Chevron is studying technologies that utilize ocean energy and is considering working with us,” a spokesman for the US oil giant’s affiliate company, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the necessary permission to launch the Alaskan project for the exploitation of marine energy, issued by the U.S. Energy Commission.
This is of little importance, especially considering that the US is currently engaged in oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are on the way to extract energy from the sea. The amount invested so far, as you can know about the details, is evidence of growing interest.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, this is still a primitive technology, just because the energy from the sea does not dispel the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy on a larger scale, installations with a more significant environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: for example, Ocean Power uses a connected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down turn the pistons and cylinders in them into hydraulic pressure.
The pressure turns on a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity flows to the mainland on cables under the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar types of facilities in the planning phase, which are only waiting for a federal license, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power generation for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six submersible turbines located in the East River Sealine in New York City.
At a tide, the movement of water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this movement of rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits to use energy.
It's a tide after the waves.
At present, special attention is needed to exploit the opportunities that can be exploited through the tide.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tidal is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008, just to exploit the energy provided by the tide, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
