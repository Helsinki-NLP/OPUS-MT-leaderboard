Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she is doing art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a long story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he was.
“I wanted to tell a person about my medical history so that the violence in the process would become visible,” Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a years-long study period, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with a referral to the diagnosis studies of "gender identity disorder", which will be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had already used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was already very far in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process in order to be able to correct the gender also legally.
The Trans Act, or the Act on Reinforcing the Gender of the Spouse (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to get the right sex, for example, to the Population Register Centre and passport.
At present, every sex remedy requires a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of inability to reproduce.
You have the right to decide your own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right of self-determination.
The previous Government of Finland prepared the amendment of the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The election came and the Finns took up the government.
The amendment is now stuck again.
It is a matter of domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient story installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The perception of the studied reality appears to be subject to destabilization.
The perception of the subject’s self appears to be fragmented at the limit state level, and the unstable traits of personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer says.
There was an even greater shock when Auer was not given sex-repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpol waiting hall off the television.
Later on, a work of art called Monument for the Exclusived was born on that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything but the amount of sex you are born with.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of gender-correction is more difficult for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people in need of help and support are denied treatment, citing that their resources are not enough,” Auer said.
Many people who have applied for the process have mental symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process started,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and that’s something that people tend to find difficult to digest.”
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, I felt relieved.
He had finally been able to express feelings that had existed since childhood and when he was a teenager.
Why a wide chin didn’t feel right for your body and why your chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from close ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts most is when people who are close to you are being abused.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of their gender.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new identity number stating that he or she is of another gender.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry issues a new personal identification number to the applicant.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also covered by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has a weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel alert to Missouri
The National Association for African-American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel alert for Missouri, which is the reason for the state’s discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
“The NAACP travel bulletin for Missouri will come into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where a number of questionable racial-based events have recently occurred,” the organization said in a statement.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to the courts, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionately targeted at minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel alert.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, in a statement to Kansas City Star.
“We haven’t heard of a lot of cases in just as short a time.”
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization's first warning about the state of the United States.
For example, the organization mentioned racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel statement also referred to the Missouri Attorney General’s report that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
“The purpose of the travel announcement is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by taking money with them to pay the guarantees or telling relatives that they’re going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth largest number of U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which advocates civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for violations of immigration, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they concern other countries, but recently, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (central) has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, this is incompatible with the declaration of the will of the state.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish Newspaper reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s decision on ownership control.
The sanctions were harsher immediately.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting at the G20 in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday had a bitter reaction in Russia.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that the sanctions law signed by Trump meant “a full-scale trade war.”
Even if the Russian reactions were only offset by political rhetoric in the form of outbursts and outbursts, the tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, the passage of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, it was reported that it was much more difficult for the president to pass the law.
Trump’s recent law is “significantly flawed.”
President Trump’s plight may have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is being conducted in the United States on Russia’s possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as on Trump’s campaign’s Russia connections.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
With the White House staff changing rapidly and a variety of scandalous twists and turns revealed almost to be up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a chimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has been prominent in the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
While the Union has so far remained, at least on the whole, united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real mess.
The effects of the recent U.S. Sanctions Act are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House Has a Statue of Liberty
The intervention in the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as everyone else: the Iraqis together with the American soldiers poured down Saddam Hussein’s statue at Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists of the Trump administration, well knew what was going on in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a grueling speech about the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruisers and figures mimicking the Statue of Liberty.
In 1903, Emma Lazarus’ poem was added to the statue’s foot – 17 years after the statue was completed.
As Miller put it, “I don’t want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller wasn’t wrong, but it’s not just history, as he himself said.
Lazarus’ touching words, the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants, but “the poorest of the poor”: “Your Tired, Your Poor, / Your Huddled Masses Years to Breathe Free, / The Wretched Refuse of Your Teeming Shore.”
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism, he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's foot, and they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to manifest the connections between French and American republicanism with the classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
The addition of the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a designer who can now be regarded as some kind of predictor of Trump – argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early forerunner of the neo-conservatives, taking the American torch into the dark-covered world: “Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The light doesn’t show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and weary but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torches don't show the way, they burn the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots reached the UK national team
Neil Black, Executive Director of the UK Athletics Federation, said 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup were “significant reinforcements.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland, “there is something special going on” about which British athletics must learn.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for as long as we understand what it is about,” Black says.
“I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation believes that it is related to the activities of the Federation,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is behind their actions.
And an ordinary streetwalker thinks he has something to do with it.
But it’s something amazing, which is what it’s all about.”
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
“His captain’s speech was amazing,” Black said.
“The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidhi’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400-metre hurdles, and these are his fifth world championship. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a mid-distance runner, has run five UK and two European records over the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and he is also worth keeping an eye on: he has an excellent season behind him, including wins at the UK World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "very proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots, some of which are seriously competing for finals and medals.
“Being a captain is a great honor, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“Of course I’m very proud of all the Scots that made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They’re part of a team of distinguished athletes competing for the prize pool.
Captain's speech?
I thought it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing.”
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
Our country's father knew what a bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, all the way to his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated me,
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep for slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also minor online.
"What does it matter? It's just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic-dominated state.
He has been ranked second among the top 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hotshots.
He has led the state firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
That is why blocking users who come to the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax resources.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was just a matter of moderation of comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They said their comments were respectful, considerate, and relevant.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
“I politely replied that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in a statement.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "a concentrated attack." Someone else could call them to promote things that were considered important.
In the era of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It’s really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of tying Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the government of Loudoun County violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association was talking to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postage payments had a similar effect to what is now on the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers moaned Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they complained about Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising Jay's agreement, the US-UK cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
There have been about 40 samples from around the world, and also online notifications from a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Marja Isomursu, special researcher at Evira.
Green bees have died from tricomonosis.
It is caused by an animal named Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been known to hit pigeons in the past, especially the pigeons.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in beekeeping birds.
In 2009 it was really good.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland’s green bee population, after which the species’ strains have been recovering.
There have been now, but at least not on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki’s Natural History Museum.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green saplings will recur unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of home field representation at Renaissance Club
Former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field play for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open is held by the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led the tournament in the neighbouring Archerfield Links field last year before the final round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is a fan of a new location and acts as an ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club and this event will bring it to its full glory,” Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best, and it's in great shape.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is a keen ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great introduction to this field.”
Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
“This feels like a very special opportunity,” says a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament isn’t part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back to mind: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to reality on his own soil and embarks on a tour after completing 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more important than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will feature six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems of the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
At least no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks of the Pori brigade’s communications company in Säkylä so far, the brigade was announced on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The investigations began when a man who had been suspended for health reasons for his military service thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, the chief of staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that the other staff in that unit had no health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this issue in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The Brigadier’s statement says that due to the arrival of the July arrival lot, the barracks had to be moved, which may have led to a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have been too heavy, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use her cooking stove.
He rarely uses a boiler.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia’s restless Papua province. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “not” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the curry is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture. He sits on a muddy painting, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as washing clothes from a nearby swamp in the muddy water.
The toilet office is supplied by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is her youngest husband of four wives, and she has not been assigned to care for the fields.
Multimarriage is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account soldiers.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare peek into the everyday life in Papua Heights, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. It was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its hatred to the Government of Jakarta, which strictly controls the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is a remote and sloping area, starting with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura to Nabier, and continuing on a five-hour drive to the stomach.
There's no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated roofs of which have been painted yellowish.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have this kind of clothing," Degei says. She means her colorful, hand-woven wrap head, dark skirt and bright blouse.
"Before, we only had leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold land.
Paniai is an upland area about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Only about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
Papua also has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they mean the repressive presence of an Indonesian strong army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua’s demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s were measured by genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the area.
The 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese, We Will Lose Everything, contains stories of last year’s atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular – and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because there are weekly cases,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed as Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants in the province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the Indonesian populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move into the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javanese warung-food chefs sell fried chicken and gado-gado-hate mix in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“Converters have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential castle.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” you said.
Pania experienced some kind of wave base only two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifles.
One of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the state election committee building near the venue was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans—young men, women, and children—assembled in the football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting strings for festive expenses, and they began to perform the traditional Waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance around and imitate the birdsong.
Some of the protesters began to stone the police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere warmed up, the soldiers received an order from the internal radio system: "If the masses are resisting more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that TIME magazine has seen that has not been published to the local media.
Yerimias Kayame, 56, Resident Director of the Kego Koto area, suspected that the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several gunshots were fired."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME magazine, saddened. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only “protecting” the police station because it was under attack.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in a statement in 2015.
"Then it's all about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the massacre came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to tackle the violence in Papua.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.”
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to cancel his speech.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but that requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start studies at Papua.
“Everything will be settled in court,” he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". Crimes are linked to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai are bleakly disbelief in their claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t made any progress,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Paneans do not dare to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had assaulted him after helping him bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers were looking for me after the victims were buried,” he said.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the director of the construction company, which began when the leader refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man in need of hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in water while fishing on a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, causing one villager to be killed.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and sees the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyain Parliament has called for the shootings of police officers to be held accountable and for the removal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes that live in the wheaty middlelands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents who claim to defend Papuan rights through random attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM’s leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "secure national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as “a sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals, too.
as well as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes to Nabire Airport were opened.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go to local better educated and wealthy migrants.
Only a few beaners have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work and no money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The remote Papua is left with little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they were granted a rare filming license. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia’s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, he has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces, Papua and West Papua, journalists are facing new risks: denial of visas and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from its immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “many and widespread violations,” including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so hiding evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.”
The locals want the governments of the foreign powers to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, a source said.
Indonesia has presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting attack,” said Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panic people: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty, practically without health care and educational facilities.
According to Gobai, the Paneans, like the other Papuans, regard the voices they give to Jokow as a “debt” that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting showed resistance in a symbolic way once again: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
“My family members were killed,” Yacobus says with a headache.
“What else can we do?”
Dereck Chisora barks at Robert Helenius's rematch cancellation: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were due to compete in the Hartwall arena on May 27.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora explains the reason why the rematch was completely flopped on Helenius’ shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The rematch ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was postponed to the autumn.
The match has never heard of anything new.
However, the withdrawal no longer bothers Chisora.
The match would probably have been cancelled after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with a lot of pain.
My dick was exploding.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora said.
The UK says it is currently in about 45% condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he is interested in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora lost to Whyte in December with a split voice.
Fire takes over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai again
The flames captured the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-meter-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one was known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the event.
“We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Department, firefighters were able to turn off the fire at 4 a.m. local time and cool down the building.
The government has announced that it will arrange accommodation for those who have left their home.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building commissioned a study to find out that the plates used for facade cladding and insulation were the most damaged.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and upholstery plates of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between Tuesday 21:00 and Wednesday 5:00.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The Mopo was a Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in colour and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.

More than 20 percent of U.S. air passengers take prohibited items on board, poll reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited items to aircraft past the U.S. Road Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other sharp objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules, 19.7 per cent were members of the Y-generation and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-generation.
The most common violation of the rules was by taking food and liquids on board the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly exporting bladed objects to an aircraft, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they had deliberately exported banned drugs to an aircraft.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken their smuggling goods past the security check and how many had consciously done so.
It is not surprising that the most frequent travellers are also more likely to pass the security check – knowingly or unknowingly.
But, as the company that conducted the survey states, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on the aircraft and how much.
It is no surprise, then, that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also a feeling that books were not allowed on the plane.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, has decided to delay Obama’s decision to reduce emissions.
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, head of EPA, of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions made during Obama’s administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he is managing takes better account of the needs of the Länder’s environmental decision-makers.
Pruitt made no mention of any action brought before the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous decision.
States should start to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standard from 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year to allow his agency more time to get acquainted with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him head of EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to ease regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies, obliging companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full translation of the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on time.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activists and others to challenge it to a court that would reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he challenged the Environmental Agency more than ten times.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA’s state-run coalition, said the group was going to continue to press.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of the smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This smoke mist can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitised groups of people, and is also part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
“It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration, for its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups pursuing their own interests."
Supercar manufacturer becoming SUV - "it happens in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time striving to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style,” CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year as the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All East Savo measles cases of the same type of virus
Coastal measles infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the National Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo’s fifth measles infection is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, is of the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in eastern Savo relate to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not shown any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections can still be detected after the fifth patient until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over,” says Mirkareena Erkkilä, Soster’s primary healthcare infectious disease doctor.
New measles outbreaks or suspicions have not been detected since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-date vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.
More on the subject: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "More infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for the promised act of chivalry
The Pontika soup was not even considered to be legalized.
In the background, the argument that the process produces methanol in addition to vodka, which is toxic.
Making a rock at home is legal next year, but the legalization of a pontificate soup is not even considered.
The kilju is made by fermentation, the pontika again by distillation.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to vodka.
There has been no political will to make a precise soup a right for all men,” said Ismo Tuominen, Government Counsellor at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, pontifical distillation was not considered to be legalised.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no discussion about the liberalisation of distillation, says MP Outi Mäkelä (kok.).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
You will not even be able to give permission for distilling pontika at home in the future.
Commercial manufacturing also remains subject to authorisation.
Importing tells us that a simple rule is to make alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a scream at home.
The government wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements for flavoring and flavourings and allows the production of a baldness, Mäkelä clarifies.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be prepared for themselves as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It should not be put on sale.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was sent to hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for a heart attack.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the British journal Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigation.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump has pressured Mexico to build a border wall
U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican-Australian leaders have leaked their phone calls to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto to stop public speaking about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called upon Nieto to announce that he had publicly thwarted the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump began his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a letter from Trump’s first speech to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of views took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is “silenceful,” “sad,” and “dirty.” Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama’s term would make him look “idiot” because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull, “This was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgia massacre: Activists re-created racist lynching in hopes of justice
The Ford Mercury-branded car bypasses the crowd in Monroe’s small town in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and wanders through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-u!" the man shrugged.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a remake, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
The shocks, however, are genuine when the log loop is hung around the neck of the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-arrange the events of 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-creation arrangements.
“It’s a shame in history, but above all it’s a burden that weighs our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, re-production is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice, we want things to be brought to an end, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all, we want justice," Brooks said.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
No one was charged with murder.
While the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Georgian state's blacks were given the chance to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, and the Supreme Court ruled in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which black landlord Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting her child.
According to the FBI, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid $600 in guarantees from Malcom on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
Along the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI report said.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks says it more succinctly.
“It was a vote-right killing,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to tell the blacks that they would do the same if they were going to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-establishment of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
It is an extremely realistic and captivating presentation, a depiction of a shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It’s hard to watch, but it’s even harder not to see what Greene says.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or want to hear what I’ve been through.”
On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been presenting the director of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always just as difficult and repulsive.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
“It is important, however, that this aspect of history be kept on the table so that it never happens again.”
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, who is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?" I said, "Get out of my mail, n---u-u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then we're gonna hit.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asked.
"Et," Greene throws.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u."
"Yes," the other black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the power of the room is a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the performance, but because they want to honor the memory of those who have died.
The scene begins from the beginning.
Now the words of Rascona are sounding.
No one laughs.
The remake ends quickly and violently.
Crying, shooting, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken in every other word.
A few hundred feet away, fifty spectators wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
There are a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks at the victims' graves in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have turned from the story to the truth, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy murmured as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who performed the lynchings take off their cloaks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs a man from Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
“It’s okay,” the woman in the show said.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Alta is busy discussing the show with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinsky finds it difficult to find words when she describes the sensations that the performance evokes.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch the horrible deeds that people say and do that look like you – precisely because they look like you,” she says.
"I found out that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Reproduction is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experience, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who don’t know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Plant hanging in stores suffocates: This is what removing "extra parts" really saves you
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the cauliflower in the store before weighing?
What about taking out a big hat from the pineapple - it weighs how much?
The answers divide opinions strongly: for one, it is a sign of extreme nuisance, while for the other, they do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable section of Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people, for example, tear off the leaf parts of the cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are exported to bio-waste.
According to the news published by the economic messages, snooping on a vegetable dish is a surprise to traders.
But how much money do you really save by removing excess vegetable parts before weighing them?
How important is it really?
We Women tested how the price changes when taking away leaves or heels from pineapple, latva artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
The price of a cauliflower costing EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80, when all the leaves were peeled off from it.
Pineapple: the price of an entire pineapple costing EUR 2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 when its stock was turned off.
Latva artichoke: The price of EUR 2.60 became EUR 2.40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two delicious mushrooms cost 75 cents in total.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Asparagus: Medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and strains are plucked off, one vegetable will save at best a few tens of centimeters.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
These purchases would have saved a total of €1.20!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian player Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid FC Barcelona, the Spanish football league, a buy-out price of EUR 222 million.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros last summer from the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League had earlier halted the move on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment company.
Under the rules of the league, the club can not pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will probably be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
In addition, Barcelona announced in its press release that it would provide information on the fee to the European Football Federation Uefa in order to enable the association to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Javier Tebas, the president of the Spanish league, has accused PSG of violating Uefa’s financial fair play rules.
Uefa can punish a company that loses more than 30 million euros in three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its financial provisions.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players at significant amounts, Uefa was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning strike, a flash recorded on the airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing normal work on a plane at the International Airport in Lunch-Florida with a couple of coworkers when suddenly lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane into the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me his brother had an electric shock and he was in the hospital.
I asked him if he was alive, Austin’s sister, Autumn, said.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain hemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It’s traumatizing to everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revitalizes business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when it started a new restructuring programme in response to the pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with the previous structural arrangements.
Pearson said it would cut costs again by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million in May as part of its third savings program, which aims to revitalize business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook unchanged for the current year. Its net sales increased by one per cent in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on escort in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber killed a soldier in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and several others were wounded.
According to NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the Kabul attack in Qarabagh.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, Thursday night’s explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan military patrol was attacked by a “self-propelled explosive device” carried by a person.
The statement stated that the condition of all the injured persons was stable and they were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area where predominantly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militant group since the US-led forces invaded the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA postpones decision to postpone the implementation of smoke regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions made during Obama’s administration the day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "Ozone Definitions" late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
“We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,” said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke rate will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-dominated states, including the District of Columbia, who said it was illegal to postpone the execution.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate Barack Obama’s environmental regulations, saying the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to EPA websites, breathing air containing ozone “can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the ISIS leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It is suspected that the bomb was scheduled to be taken on the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended prior to the security check.
The police will not tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of the suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels are doing well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Matti Lievosen, CEO, the company made a good profit in oil products, the sales volume of renewable products rose to a record level, and the development of the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and a more favourable market, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future for a series of fewer than 66.7 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms on ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles, until WBC's unbeatable lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, WBO's upper featherweight champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the four-weight world champion Adrien Broner with a unanimous decision at Showtime, and since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on a list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How are you doing, master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at seven.
When the two pose for photographers, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between the men would be “perfect in terms of size.”
"I'm an ex-steamer," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the series [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the light series.
He's gonna have to get into the light kit [61,2 kg], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Fulfill their wishes.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing needs this match."
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut later this year in the lightweight series and fight Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 knock-out wins). Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell at the Forum. Linares and Campbell
"The fight could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he would be ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as a "incredible fighter" and that he may be going to watch Saturday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he first focused on showing the force of impact and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was going to be more and more intense.
“This is the game that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
“I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary of 5,300 euros, training whatever happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
Last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker’s investment advisor spoke a full bundle when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
These are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Finance Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service complete their APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV-investigation diplomas Oy, whose degree team includes experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "very broad in terms of requirements".
The study material of the studies includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Almost all investment service providers from the largest banks have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 degree, as it is mandatory to do so according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bank branches without mentioning the names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing the qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, such bankers are "some".
According to Savikko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people and the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisors have been completed by approximately 3,000 people.
Some bankers consider the completion of a degree to be an advantage.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because then it is the expertise related to the investment sector that is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average earnings of monthly paid regular working hours are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in the workforce earn more than €5,900 per month, while women earn more than €4,500.
The top 10 earners earn around 8,100 euros on average.
A tenth of the men who earn the most earn more than 9,000 euros a month or more, and a tenth of the women who earn the most earn 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the employee and task level, self-regulation has so far been relied upon.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva met individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were insufficient due to the activities of the advisor.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if the skills and qualifications are at a hectic level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements,” says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II.
This requires each firm to be responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently knowledgeable.
The Financial Supervisory Authority may, in turn, have the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements for the know-how and experience of investment advisors and investment product sellers.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to both the investment firm’s own staff and the tied agents who sell the products on behalf of a company.
According to Hovi, according to a proposal from the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be given the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided with these prospects in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this has to be documented and the company has a duty of proof that this has been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel’s positions at the individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced within the time limit if the level of knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules tighten and become more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Picture: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "draws" a giant plane over the United States
The plane's route was drawn over the United States on Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which Boeing tested the long-haul endurance of the Rolls Royce engines.
The plane that left Seattle flew 15,700 kilometres in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the United States’ borders throughout the entire journey.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra’s persistent beach bathing schoolchildren don’t miss the rain or the sun’s roast - Iines Kaikkonen persistently trampled with the help of a swimming p<0xC3><0xB6>tkylä
Iines Allikonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra’s swimming schools run in Liete and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, the young swimmers are not moksis, says head of swimming schools Taina Itkonen.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children will be able to swim, a dozen next week.
The next week’s number of children was influenced by the fact that by then school and eskar will begin, Itkonen said.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation with the project Liikunta <0xC3><0x9C>histe and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach in Liete had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimming schoolchildren were training to stay on the surface with the swimming pools, someone even without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaiko, 5, first suspected going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to sneak towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
The beach is good for him.
Like Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with the swimming p<0xC3><0xB6>tkylä.
You too will be pleased with today’s achievements, the swimming pool praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted water wars.
Ilona Villberg, her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been bad, Anna likes to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming schools packed up on the pier.
The boys had plenty to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, sunbathe the fruit and bake the day.
The teaching continued in the water, but there was no hurry at the pier.
It's not summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a connecting story"
You can see it all.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a few days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks, and a "wc brush with a border brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film, which will be premiered this autumn.
Still, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been teased on social media: When will the unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määt, Vice President, Blue Product say?
We are the film’s partner.
We support this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film,” says Määttä.
According to him, there will be a special introduction to the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn’t there something a little funny about this – often when you think that products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, here is such a connecting story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products,” says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
Cleaning is no stranger to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the film are Valio, Hartwall, Saluto, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichyt, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, has been introduced to the market.
Unknown products have already been spotted by Suomen Kuvalehti blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time to go on.
Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet revealed their war products.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that over 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish national forensics agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the forensics agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of the asylum seekers tested, i.e. 2002, were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases, the forensics agency determined that the person to be tested was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there were grounds for doubting the age indicated by the applicant.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, the forensics agency, the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no big differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were defined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were " indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinian Institute, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity, which can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I’ve had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the method used is the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age for sure, we shouldn’t pretend that we can,” he told Metro News.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, the forensic agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test is about 18 years old, and then the risk is about 10 percent."
Ilonen lost 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 laps downhill on the European golf tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left from position 11 on Saturday, but at the end of the round we found a place 41.
In difficult weather, Ilosen was accompanied by three bogis by one double bogi.
Others were difficult too.
The Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot with one under par round, although he told me that there was enough work to do in the umbrella’s trunk.
Keli was raw, but I hung out and finally the day was good, Poulter tuumi.
He shares a leading position with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to change party
West Virginia’s Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he would change the party at the Trump campaign.
“The Democrats simply abandoned me,” Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thorough reflections, I can tell you... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The crowd burst into raving applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump has promised that a major announcement will be made at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his assets is about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday that “the change of the party of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that builds barriers rather than a better America.”
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people,” RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS.
The lightnings have sown damage - Thursday will be even the worst thunder day of summer
In the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also be added to southern Finland.
Over the past week, it has erupted especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes set fire to several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the worst day of the summer so far.
They have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, lightning has emanated especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the table lightning struck the power center of the row house, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received a report of the fire about 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 a.m. on Wednesday.
The electricity station was located in the sauna area at the end of the row house.
The Rescue Department dismantled the roof and wall to find fire pits and extinguished the fire in a flash.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, the lightning ignited the outside building's flares in Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire phase, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
The 50-square-foot building burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in Rääkkylä, the lightning struck the private house again.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department visited to check the case, but this time the lightning did not catch a fire - only a few fuses blew up.
In traffic, the thunderstorm caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received on Thursday morning between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was solved just before five in the afternoon.
Since then, the train traffic has also been able to continue normally on a section of the line that is framed by a thunderstorm.
The lightnings have sown destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been quite unsightly! according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
Wednesday and Thursday’s thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, it also feels like a lot even strong.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s thunderstorms,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, landslides burst 1,700 times, and on Thursday, there has been potential even to the toughest day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 landslides in the plaque.
If the lightning continues to the beginning of the evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking thunder year was seen in 2015, when the flash volume of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the amount of lightning this year had increased to 18,386 lightnings.
So there is still something to be done to ensure that this year does not break the "preliminary record" two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus is expected to shift from the northern parts of the country to the south by Saturday, where you can get about 2,000 lightning days on both Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country there will be a more uniform rainforest.
According to Tuovise, in such a way, thunders only infrequently.
Coe praises Russia’s “open mind” apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe praised his open-minded apology for the doping scandal he described on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shlyahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was "sorry" for all the athletes who took the gold or silver medal in the competition.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything it could to reorganise its activities.”
Coe said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that it is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
“We will have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Athletics Championships in London starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the banned coaches are still working freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
“Tom of Finland didn’t become as successful as the authors wanted,” says Yle.
To be honest, I’m disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Helsinki Film’s CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is a small amount compared to the film’s budget of around EUR 5 million.
This did not result in any lottery winnings, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been successful in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive ever player transfer in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play financial rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to terminate the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new club is tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its star chart, as it finances the Qatar oil-rich dynasty.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums of money to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that the football business is not loss-making.
The economic rules of the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair play financial rules shifted from clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of Roman Abramovich’s first business model in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of money for player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of the Fair Game Economic Rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
While Platini was forced to leave the presidency of UEFA scandalously in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in use, and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the fair game's financial rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may deduct the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and on Manchester City, which was financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing their income through the companies associated with the owners of the club.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual revenue.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was oversized.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could be financed by payments from Qatar’s World Cup organizing committee for 2022.
However, PSG and the Organising Committee have refused to make Neymar an ambassador for the World Cup, and UEFA would be very easy to disclose such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA will follow more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources on Thursday reported that UEFA had not negotiated a transfer of Neymar with PSG.
The sources gave the interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit to more than EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of companion products and game shirts.
The association estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make the transfer of Neymar more difficult, allegedly in violation of the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, told the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which owns an American sports club.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football operating environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of a fair game. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it’s urgent: Finnish World Championships athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-legged Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although she should be coaching at the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter in a British broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organisers of the World Cup as a document, but he is not qualified to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or not, said Jorma Kemppainen, the head of coaching.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself before, but now there are some problems.
He'll do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach’s possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and last a week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value race to another, where the experience of acquiring matures the athlete’s performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, nor are there any competitors.
The World Cup requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising thing about sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to watch the races, even though the London medals are not solved until late in the evening due to the time difference.
In the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Daggers are still waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the results of the last few years of his and other throwers and Pitkämäki’s stay in the competition last summer are told by others.
Whatever the case, Pitkämäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition for other Finnish athletes or making your own record is a good enough achievement.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt of the coming years of Finnish athletics will be a great success in the international youth championships this summer.
The processing of young talents and the financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench sportsmen.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will remain in history in the hands of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not, for example, because of the fear of terrorism or the cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air competition in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The women's competition was won by Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the Caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and feels good now, but it’s a shame that the last jump didn’t go well.
I will try it again in the race, Tuumi Rukajärvi.
In the snowboarding big air, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new long-haul ship docked in Helsinki
The new fleet carrier FSTR from Viking is very late.
The express ship had to leave from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There were eight ships on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for you to get on the ship.
Now the car queue is moving a little bit, Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting to board at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical failure on the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting to enter the ship in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund told IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund says the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Kuutostie on Thursday night

The transport from Mälkiä to Mustola harbour runs along road 13.
Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story revolves around the days of the 80s and the 90s grunge (at that time David Wai and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State sketches for MTV) as well as their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived in its time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (which included the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s voice-speaking vegetable can).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching adulthood. Its emphasis makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, 90s stalker movies, such as the horror movie Hand that rockes the cradle.
In one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but has still not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the age-old Paul Rudd, who has a razor under his lower lip, Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles. Rudd's acting Andy, the camp's gift, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may take this series off as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go on to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different nostalgia: The Americans series’ Cold War spirit, Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series’ wrestling scene, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, and is a romantic 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest cop fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The film stars Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici as Gregorina and idealist Iosef, who have dubbed Channing Tatum (the lead producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea,
But it's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too attached to the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama – including a killer hidden behind Reagan’s mask, for example. That’s why the series often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant enough.
In summary, the series could function better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby who devour hamburgers.
The message to the imaginative communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a result of our own recent history and their history.
Kouvola-based Toni Taurus rises in the ring in Macau on Saturday - against former UFC fighter
Toni Taurus wants to keep the match up.
Toni Taurus gets a hard bone in Macao, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in the UFC last year.
Brazilians also have a black jujutsu belt and a world championship.
For once, I take myself against my parents.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Taurus says.
Kouvola had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were brought to the Chinese autonomous region of Macau on a quick schedule.
Taurus has never faced such a thing before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It was annoying, because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has come for the fight.
Waiting for a week doesn’t have much to do with preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you practice too much.
Taurus has faced opponents in a few of his previous struggles, whose strengths are in being able to fight.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvola describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come up hard in the first round and try to take the carpet.
He has won the World Jujutsu Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last match of the Kouvola didn't go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines hit Taurus very hard in the eye, and the victory remained with the Philippines.
I've never been so good, especially when I'm standing up: he didn't get a hit.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It really bothered me for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the freelancers fight once a year, some rise more frequently in the ring.
For example, the next opponent, Issa, was last seen in September.
Taurus had three matches last year.
This is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten heavy.
In recent years I have been training and in good shape all the time.
But I've only been there for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We had some really good trainings when there was a friend from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola must prepare for the physical struggle.
I've trained against opponents of the same size and I've been able to practice standing.
This is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit it sensibly.
If there's a chance, I'll take it to the property myself.
Sub-exports should not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macao is still attracting the previously held Taurus in China.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great night ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been untenable and inflationary easing has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue slowly, and the Bank has shifted interest rates as the income level of families is under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent by a vote of 6-2. This month, the Koronvosto received less and less support because of the lack of economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that household income levels are under increasing pressure, as inflation is still expected to pick up close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation spurred by Brexit, and the Bank announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more affordable funding to banks through the programme, i.e. a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The Bank’s interest rate decision protocol states: “According to the financial policy committee’s forecast, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years, as the decline in households’ real income reduces consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that in order to curb inflation, "some degree of tightening up of monetary policy" is needed to "just a little more broadly" the market's expectations.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase was "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
Punta weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31; compared to the euro, it decreased by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after lower than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rates, with GDP rising by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank says that the situation will worsen before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income decline in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "significantly" recover at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were reduced to 0,25 % following the shock of the referendum in the EU, which plunged the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the central bank’s most recent decision, interest rates had started to be demanded more loudly as inflation tightened pressure on households, with three decision-makers demanding a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the Bank said it was expected to do so and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its 2% target level was due to the "total" weak pound.
“Given the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying as lenders are feverishly seeking customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, chief executive of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Refurbishment agreements are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS orders 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a “reversible” anti-HIV drug, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the funding of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A drug taken before intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Supreme Court upheld the Supreme Court’s ruling last year, according to which the NHS will be able to pay PrEP, although it claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as "decisive for an important moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be taken before sexual intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
The drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body that prevent HIV infection during sexual intercourse.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates for the experiment from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered for the treatment of a general practitioner can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and this week the English NHS signed a contract for medicines after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
“It is yet another significant achievement in the more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of mankind’s greatest health challenges.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
“If PrEP is properly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it can have a pivotal impact on England’s HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, people at risk will receive a drug through an experiment funded by the NHS, which they can decide for themselves without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have a empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one in the risk group is left out,” said Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was delayed for several months due to government slowing down,” said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government’s health minister.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get a step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been halted."
Quality of life: Intermediate layer and smart interior solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge’s residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna’s era-style house. The success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed up and moved.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in a much bigger apartment in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show and noticed that the rooms were as tall as my apartment at the time.
I was instantly impressed and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has experienced a complete deformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate layer to make use of the room height.
“I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadin from the Duck & Shed Design Office in Notting Hill, where he was tasked with taking advantage of the space of nearly four meters tall rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale destination, but a home.
The height of the room wasn’t enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
“The steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged on top of each other so that they didn’t have to crumble.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right on top of them and below."
Erfan was able to place two fully-height rooms on top of the room with fascinating details.
On the middle floor there is a copper-crossed window of Retrouvius into a stylish living area.
Mirrored furniture, silver effects and vintage lighting by Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, sense of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem more real.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window with a view of another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
What adds to the style is that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne’s kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slides very easily when lifted up."
With the intelligent use of space and the design of storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, another bedroom and an even better floor plan.
“When selling the dwelling, the area is determined – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In principle, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
“No one gets attached to the power lines on the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia shines in her summer look
Princess Sofia's living room was hit by a button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad for the last time before giving birth.
At the dinner of A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia was smiling at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow at the seminar in a gorgeous blue body-fitting outfit that dressed up a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia represents her birth.
His scheduled time is in September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess beautifully.
Sofia has been on a mission to B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia was even excited to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said with a laugh and referred to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a home appeared in Lahti, where Thai food was sold.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
At home, Panya Suamsri-Pentilä sold food, among acquaintances Panja.
He didn’t know much Finnish, and the Finns didn’t know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lathians to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the country, he said.
I got hooked from the latch.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai restaurant in Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you’re hungry and there’s limited space, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with the dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the Market Hall, but then the restaurant had to change, because self-made spice pastes were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now, we crooks can sit at our own tables again, only in the busiest times will we be shy to ask the guests if there is room next to it.
The banker knows his client.
They tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of his customers change and the food company changes.
He remembers what name I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
She remembers me lean and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange the belongings with Panja, who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our minds and hearts.
Today, many people speak to him Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated the fulfillment of two decades.
Our customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
In the early part of the year, security officials received a list of important aspects of counter-terrorism work.
The list includes data from more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people in total and the document includes not only their personal data, but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorist identities and images while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background there was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists as ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s country of origin.
The list also includes a list of terrorist specialisms.
For example, in the case of the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list, Abu Assid al-Almani, or German, is the battle name.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012 to travel first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his image.
There is no more specific information about the fate of the man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe in the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.

Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, and the dispute relates to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football club chairman and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak area just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court the dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate assets when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in suburban areas.
According to the contract with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets and Paul describes his father as “the carrying force and central figure of the family.”
According to court documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal for himself," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with in the Supreme Court on Friday, after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the claim isn't true, and he blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes, together with his first sworn testimony, that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of conventional statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store “in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their boys in a friendly manner.
“The reader often said that he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke received $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “disrupting from the economic conditions of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he said in his text that he could not comment on the matter because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag me to court, according to the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, adding that he hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
“We will be resolved in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s use of the media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s media use and follow-up to the news so that the boss doesn’t get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
“When the White House’s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with management staff on his first day of work, he spoke of a key problem he is going to solve: he is going to limit the availability of information for President Donald Trump.
Kelly told White House employees that all the information – both printed and heard at press conferences – must be passed through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president, he continues to watch a lot of television.
“If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about the unfair news, he was encouraged to show that sympathetic media dealt with things more equally,” Trump’s adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote that “six former campaign workers say it is essential that Trump’s Twitter use is controlled by a steady stream of praise in his personal media.”
All right.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s Twitter use has never been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something we don’t know—perhaps Trump’s tweets would have been even more fierce without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump hasn’t sent.
If even a few times his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing factions in the White House that are trying to push their agenda by providing Trump with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately give the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher said of a case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be tremendously enraged by the press clips that criticise him — especially if they tell him about harmful data leaks — then he’ll have to know where the data comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a copy of the news from the GotNews.com website, founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and canceled them later, and he also did not provide any concrete evidence.
However, Trump had started the case after he read the story, asking the staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then Human Resources Manager Reince Priebus and White House Personnel Secretary Rob Porter had “trying to introduce a system of document management for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still doing their own things.
These unaltered facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian player Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid FC Barcelona, the Spanish football league, a buy-out price of EUR 222 million.
The Treaty of Neymar with Barcelona was therefore dissolved and he was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros last summer from the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatari company.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Raija Oranen, a success writer, said: “I am in good shape in my life.”
From the TV series Ruusu’s Time and Clean White Sheets, renowned success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan once took away the depression and alcoholism that he has survived.
The exterior is also 20 pounds lighter.
Weight dropped when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were antidepressants.
I used to get help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
“Alcohol takes a person,” says the radiating author openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who have worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I asked, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen he has always been, has ended his life from that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made an extensive career as a writer, remembers only the good 44-part Clean White sheets of a TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided on the clothing industry as the branch of the Raikka family company when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing business and sometimes I acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
The plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, she has many scripts to work on - ideas of hundreds.
The people returned to the alley of the millionaires.
The wealthiest house owners in the West Midlands are once again hairless with stubborn circulars, who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the fields next to the houses.
The visitors parked their twenty caravans near a street called the alley of millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as a roadblock. They brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The circlers managed to cross the barrier of passage at a point left unprotected due to the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us that on Monday evening, the visitors arrived from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at the passers-by.
“The state must be toughened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circlers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more of them today.”
The resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by refusing access to the parks.
“Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the pilgrims returned so soon after they were driven away.
“There are more of them, and they’ve even lowered the horse into the grazing park.”
According to a spokesman for Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Enraged people surround the Portuguese plane
In Portugal, men who landed on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
As a result, two people died yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane may be charged with the death penalty.
The longest one can be held in Portugal for 16 years.
Yesterday, due to a technical problem, a small plane was forced to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
At the time of the event, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran a landing plane into the water to escape.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach, told the newspaper.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, a witness to the incident, said.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that more people didn't die.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the forced landing.
A Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won the World Cup gold again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland’s time in the World Cup in banked slalom at the Big White competition in Canada early Wednesday morning.
Suur-Hamari also won the cross World Cup in the past.
There have already been three World Cup titles.
What an incredible World Cup!
Two times gold was treated, quite a good heart rate is drawn, the telephone-bound Suur-Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and a very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is constantly increasing.
The whole Paralumi board has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
He lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had been eager to go down with his friends, and the accident did not take him to the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to whisper.
Those cards are played, which are dealt, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call serious misfortune and the loss of limbs a lucky kick, and the Great Hamar will not.
But he turned a terrible hardship in his favor.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Prior to the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest snowboarding passion was already fading.
It wasn’t until after the accident that the crane started to hit the top.
When I was young, I was training with friends, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself at the X-Games launch.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to put the overalls on and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with Leo-Pekka Tähte’s choice as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion was awarded at the sports gala in January.
According to the Great Hamar, the victory of the star is an important signal to the parasports force.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open the eyes to the world of parasports.
When is the time to launch the two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s annual sports campaign?
We'll see in due course.
I try my best to succeed.
Even the Great Hamar has not conquered all the peaks he craves.
Next year we will have a big goal.
The Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea in a year.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees fry bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab teenagers for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half of whom are men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42% of respondents thought they would return to their home country and 4 percent didn’t know how to say it.
According to the study, the youth’s decision to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent return home, while a quarter think that the most important thing would be ISIS leaving the country.
Only less than one-tenth of the most important factors affecting the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Young Syrians were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believes that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter consider the Assad presidency to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to put an end to the ongoing conflict in Syria.
To resolve the conflict with the help of military action alone, only a quarter do not believe.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the power of ISIS weakened over the past year, while a fifth see it strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media would inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many of them made military measures and education reform a priority.
One in ten think that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the effects of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump’s term.
The opinions are divided into two parts as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoded to keep the web in order - the database he developed is used, for example, by Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a Espoo-based company, is developing an open source database that is "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything, and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there,” explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology leader at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beauty will help to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database MySQL together with David Axmark, Sweden.
In 2008, the technology company Sun acquired MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, the software giant Oracle seized Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, who didn’t make a firm promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
At this stage, he had already set up a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of the best developers from Sun and I made sure that the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the development of MariaDB's code.
"No such verifications were made during MySQL," Widenius laments.
While many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“Over the past few years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, Chief Financial Officer at MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a small part of the company’s key figures.
To the extent he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be a contract for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among others, the Spanish operator Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically distributed to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
“Our customers include some of the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks,” Paqvalé said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oracle’s MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing, seals.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases don’t even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, since most users do not pay anything for these softwares.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases at that time would have been exchanged openly or at least the transition would have been initiated.
Big companies do not get new customers because most choose open source.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius says.
Since it is difficult to change the closed database, most of the customer companies have been obediently ingesting price increases.
“There are a lot of customers to whom it’s really difficult to move because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming to full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now expected to employ more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed at how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the customer is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to do code.
The community helps and does things that it can’t or can’t do.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters of Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models over open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches on this topic every year around the world.
Italy increases its attitude towards civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees in the Mediterranean on their ships, that they should not continue to operate unless they commit themselves to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement published on social media.
“We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on Russian-style refugees directly from traffickers who re-entered the boats.
One of these cases is alleged to have occurred only a couple of kilometres off the Libyan coast, as evidenced by the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and is seen as a motivation to help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that they considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders organization.
Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that measures to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that it is planned to continue this month's discussions with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner at Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6>, suspect found on the ground - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place at Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6> Kuttas last December.
According to police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has been said that both were seasonal workers.
Police said the suspect had fled the country with two dogs.
The man was found cold on the ground and did not resist.
The case must be prosecuted in less than a week.
The case may still be filed with the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, famous for Harry Potter and My All-Haired Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was reported by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as Magician Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the All-Haired Friends series based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC’s popular series was shot over seven times.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide Text Messages
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that she was accused of inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, executes 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at a Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed against the judgment and was allowed to await the hearing of the application in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said that both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a crying look at the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“He decided on Conrad’s life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for this,” the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter’s “age, maturity, and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement in which she said, "It won't take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this, and I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was "displeased" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never be spared," Camdyn said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hurry yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy committed suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and, "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention at Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox’s opinion in which he stated: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability in Russia’s eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said that NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that the US-Russia relationship was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump said he would like to thank the US Congress for its poor progress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi is making changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
The president of BMW said the company believed that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home city of BMW in Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of the recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralising equipment are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of sympathising with major car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies try to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed fraud devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Audi Motor Development Department, responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions requirements. The indictment was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela’s vote starts a fraud investigation, big demonstrations
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election outcome,” Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro vows to end the crisis
In Venezuela, a controversial vote was taken on Sunday to elect a representative council to change the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country’s national security forces began taking over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are intended to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence
The lavender has become a symbol of southern France’s Provence region, but is now threatened by climate change.
The lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem feverishly.
"Laventeli is directly at risk in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, the rainfall in spring and especially in autumn has decreased markedly," says Eric Chaisse, a specialist at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute for Agriculture in Provence.
"This will shorten lavender's life.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cassettes to the area, which spread bacteria."
Bets are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer essential oil-containing parts."
The solution is sought by increasing watering efficiency, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, varieties that are more resistant to drought are developed.
Reporter's murder manifests a growing threat in Mexico
The Riodace newspaper, which is published once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them to a delivery that was the subject of a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking reporters for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels are written on the table. They are criminals who make the news of the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto took office in December 2012. The federal government has protected 589 journalists who have been subjected to attacks and threats. This year at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
She is deeply missed, even though she is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture with Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture says: "Rightness". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a brand-shaped panama.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was established, particularly for dealing with journalists’ cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
Journalists are rarely prosecuted, as are thousands of murders per year related to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Riodoce’s journalists plan to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
“This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left Riodoce in Culiacan, the state capital, on 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks on his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably linked to the magazine’s name: Riodoce means “twelve rivers.”
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left with a wife and two grown children.
Rumors move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is a bit of a waste of time.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has two-story tombs of drug lords that are larger than many houses.
The state on the coast is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, a 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoc, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that wages a war against Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s sons may have been upset by the incident: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues, and the shares in the magazine were sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a high-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the newspaper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodace won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for the courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without hesitation.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life,” he said after receiving the award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "lifestyle," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A reporter must take on a task that falls on him – or act like a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was sowing death here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdezia – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always received hugs and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how they can best do their job and stay alive.
Criminals don’t like it when we talk about their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out,” Bojorquez said.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trusting in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodocé journalist Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in the case of Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become clear that only spy programs sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought a shade of wood to protect themselves from the heat of 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the reporters, with their half-playing, calculated whether these two police officers were among the 50% that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had already been months since reporters had visited a mountainous country dominated by drug gangs.
This week's issue of Riodoc's delivery was scheduled for three main cases.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s spending was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor’s office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant had been registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which was the son of "El Chapo" Guzman, who managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the abduction from the Valdez column.
“In the past, we would have known what had happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored. The employees of the newspaper have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left for the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration that was the cause of another journalist’s murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adam.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, and in demonstrations on the sidewalks and buildings, "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to get international support to investigate the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from government affairs because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articleulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murder has a debilitating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his cut-out head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Break.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to drug cartels: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or entire country.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who used to be a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, Riodoce's reporters sat on the sidewalk at midnight on Friday in front of the delivery, after the magazine's latest issue had been completed.
19 people were killed in a shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war escalated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
I had to re-make the front page the next day.
Sirens roar nearby – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the delivery guards:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoc's editorial continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the operation. "How could I stop the magazine when our intern asked me to get on the street to do the case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen’s Olympic project began with a huge setback – “Hard Place”
In April, Hannu Manninen, aged 39, was short-lived, as a professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period started disastrously when Manninen got sick with the flu.
It started with a long illness that lasted almost five weeks.
In May, it was almost completely sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a pediatric disease like ear infection, which I had to eat antibiotics for.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was a tough place when I didn’t get the benefit of training,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomi.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, which was shown in the KIHU non-rolling test of the competition and top sports research centre KIHU, carried out on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on rollers on a rug, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertips with a needle.
Last autumn I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
“There’s a wall,” Manninen says.
In the right direction
After the initial stroke, Manninen says he was healthy.
I have done a wide range of calm aerobic exercises with which I have tried to normalize my body’s metabolism.
This is a really good five-week period.
It was also one and a half weeks off from the flight.
I also had time to visit my family at the cottage.
In the last season, Manninen took part in only four World Cup races before the Lahti World Cup home games.
The best result was seen in the opening competition when Manninen reached 18th in the top ski.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that will last until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, I would like to attend at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be made to participate in Seefeld.
Hopefully the name will be on the Olympic team’s list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Manninen.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002, a gold medal in a team competition celebrated by the Nummela underline.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, the researchers have revealed the first results of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Addoni of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that the researchers were even able to determine that its Finnic skin was red-brown and had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best species in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the accession period 110–112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, armored vegetarians are the best-preserved fossil in their species.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal paleontological museum of Tyrell.
For six years the beast was excavated from a 1,100-kilogram block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
“If you blink your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping,” says Caleb Brown, a science writer who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrell.
"It remains in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Studies on the skin revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged by its predators, and was also protected by a darker and lighter colouring from the top, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrell.
Researchers named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig the dinosaur out.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine its body’s scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring in which the body is darker on top and lighter under.
The observation was still a surprise, as Borealope is considerably larger than the current animals with the corresponding coloring.
From this it can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs harvested it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
Of the current animals, for example, deer, zepros and armadillos have the same coloring. They are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the accession period were,” Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaurus scales reveals that its skin was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including studying the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell into the river when it died and sank into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was at that time as warm as it is now in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its fin skin has survived and it has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form,” Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
Its perception does not require much imagination: if you stretch your eyes a little, you can almost believe that it was asleep.”
The union period was an era of theropods, huge bipedal, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus Rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-tonne monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, which believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found at the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and armors from the muzzle to the hips.
On average, the Nodosaurs were five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two six-foot-long spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in small details in the underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains in the pits of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "as rare as winning a lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The pitted plates of its challopanssar still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forearm is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on the sole of the foot.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: To whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high schoolmate:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
Disturbed, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets by <0x40>TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis, who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, who had been shot by a white police officer in an unarmed 18-year-old black man named Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
That user had also posted a picture of Brown's inanimate body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, he was told that people were gathering at Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police lock-up tapes and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, who was on the sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell watched a live video of the police standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of another police officer tuning his rifle and shouting, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’ve already gotten used to and could be called typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell went to fetch his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a documentary film called "Whose Streets?", which premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who went out to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell was driving towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and matching crown, they had a new conversation about "what it is to live in black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers what he said to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't have taken my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
“The events of today are the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and grow into it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he must know what we must do to liberate ourselves, to liberate ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a campground for activists as they waited for information on the case and finally learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell began to react to activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Association of Nurse Students of Minorities. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any experience with organization.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary at the evening rally.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to simply tell" what was happening.
Ferrell thought of the doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times when people appeared in the local community, usually white people, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a voice in common," Folayan said in an interview.
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism with the prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals. The shooting team followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how local people are portrayed in the film, because I am shown in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader, but a community", but that Ferrell proved to be more open to the public.
That’s why the documentary shows surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as she tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the human portrayal of blacks require a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story times and refocuses the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept up the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure it all."
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women.”
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the document "intentionally" because of his queer identity.
“He got the energy going,” Folayan says.
"But it's no coincidence that she was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot in play.
His energy is transmitted from the screen.”
The news groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the Community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole, and was convicted of blocking the highway in a demonstration.
His description of the social climate of his home is short and succinct: "Interruption."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned outside Ferguson’s streets three years ago:
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York is hung in the center of the exhibition space with faces of white, black and brown, between which, in more detail, one can see the resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served 35 years in prison, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology, and art in his work. Manning is a transsexual and groundbreaking dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and based on his genetic data created 30 portraits. They are a sharp, albeit a little theoretical, statement on DNA data adaptability, ambiguity, and the underlying causal relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly reported that she has been identified with women since she was a teenager, and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including espionage, computer fraud, and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular black-and-white selfie, where Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car. He has a platinum-white wig on his head, which became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a hugely popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, obtained DNA data on, for example, cigarette butts and gums, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey- Hagborg told a news conference.
Manning was unable to visit and was not photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA image.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondents, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-created the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which described a future where the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a national military prison.
It’s also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, as Donald Trump wages his own war against data leakers and transgender soldiers, and continues to invent new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions he actually had to mitigate.
Dewey Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is the artist’s statement and underneath it is Manning’s great autograph, in which the point of surname i is the heart. In his opinion, the artist demands an end to the “automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based”.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist uses – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories. Here are 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page of the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone in his hand.
“If they make you quiet, they’ve won,” it says.
"Never shut up."
“The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
In contrast to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted with a face based on his own genetic data as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It’s purposeful, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA sequence is written with a pencil on a height that’s the same as his height (157.5 cm).
“The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd to them,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
“I wanted to describe Chelsea’s mass movement, which was also behind her release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee found suspected of murder
Police say they have launched nationwide searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incision wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for Social Relations at the University, said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a crime that is being investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the University and a spokesman for Somerville College said: “We’ve been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Chicago police chief Anthony Guglielimi said he strongly urged suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly focusing on our searches,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
He said the police had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the sight as terrible at the scene.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," he told the police.
Moffatt must provide 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and “kill all Muslims.”
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment.
Police said they were alerted to the bookstore on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had “a threat to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.”
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to bookstore events.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same suit as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” Moffatt told police.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620, i.e. about €690 in legal costs and <0xC2><0xA3>85, i.e. about €95 in compensation to the victims.
According to Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are not reported.
“We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency’s WADA roadmap to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Commission’s RUSADA mandate.
“Some of the road map measures have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA’s road map has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which defines the conditions for restoring the powers of the RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the website of the organisation.
It does not contain anything that is of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced, and everything will be accomplished.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, ordered by WADA.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we can’t admit things that didn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, President of Russia’s Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there had been problems in Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease its doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA leader Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July and, after a visit, he said the organization was on the “right track” towards the restoration of powers.
British organization skeptical of Finland’s beloved innovation: There is “no evidence” of the health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian say that Lullaby Trust, which is fighting back-to-back deaths, has banned the use of its own brochures in UK maternity packs.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity package reduces the risk of a blind death.
Handcuffed death is an unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in the safety of a child’s sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them, as it would imply that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two dead per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving a box to each family can be one factor.
But that cannot be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and covert deaths.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends that you use the pack only for daytime sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and making sure that they do not get wet or dirty.
The frog escaped from the Japanese zoo again.
Japanese zoo staff are looking for a stray tortoise.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo via the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we’re very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old frog is female, 55 kilos and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the frog is allowed to travel freely in the area of the garden.
The zoo has not received any sightings of the tortoise.
The last escape was in the last week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
He decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have come to the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and population groups, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services, and in some cases, direct contact with senior management beyond the board.
“You can track your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint Startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
For three years, Ermett has been using Glint’s software, and he says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick queries and votes for specific teams. It can also create a map that shows at a glance which departments the employees are most unhappy with and which managers have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Errett may have been able to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow a workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. Around the transport company has been agitated since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global industry that, according to Let's Talk Payments, could reach over $118,7 billion by 2020.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year, when Uber’s reputation suffered a crash.
The company has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real-time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if the manager has reason to doubt the misconduct, the complaints go directly to the company’s board of directors.
“Public opinion has superseded the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethical, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address with which he was able to report to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," said James Vitrano, Director of Laws at Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the collapse of audit firm Arthur Andersen in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicized.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent have the support of venture capitalists.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of USD 60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a truly useful company.
“Workers are more committed to the company’s success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee rewards and well-being.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they interest investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information on employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you need to be prepared to hold four thousand discussions,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a business consulting firm who has seen companies rely too much on collecting information.
“If the company doesn’t take action, the employees start to wonder if they’ve been heard.
Does their opinion matter?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Ermentti, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly personnel surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to make changes to teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of its employees in a sector known for its high turnover.
“If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses its employees, it loses its customers.
Without customers, there are no businesses.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of spying on his naked female neighbor, according to a news agency.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging outside her window at the end of the rope.
The woman said her cell phone camera shot at the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, ran into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after it was recalculated in the window.
A 20-year-old man has admitted to portraying a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed a woman’s face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed and the police were unable to return it as evidence.
In the interrogations, the man admitted the act, but denied that he had committed the crime.
The man he described was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor “just as crazy.”
According to the TT news agency, a man is being prosecuted.
Teachers demand more money in the autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed,” said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of OAJ.
A temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to conclude agreements in which the examination would not in any way involve the holiday money cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be concluded once private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, the terms of employment of OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed by the Luukkainen.
Luukkanen is also the chairman of the Public Sector Educated Negotiation Organisation Jukko.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cuts increase earnings differentials
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a weakening of the purchasing power of public sector employees, while the purchasing power of the private sector is growing.
According to Luukkanen, temporary holiday money cuts further exacerbate the differences in earnings.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins’ players’ day went up as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus's new training ground.
Some of them have stripped off their jerseys, and their backs shine from sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the students return to the dorm to read the final exams. The next morning they meet at half past seven at the Wasserman Football Centre.
“The next three days are going to be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday’s shift to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation for university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises started at about 7 p.m., and it was hard to find space on players’ already full schedule.
This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six-year Westwood coach season that has been going through Mora, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the change in the NCAA’s rules, even though it made the players’ schedule even tighter.
“We’re really putting a lot of strain on them for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there to the video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central Africa on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially strives for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the leadership of the country since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, for example, distorting the statistics on poverty.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to make an effort, as the constitution, which was limited to two terms of the presidency, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been carried out and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in the unification of the land that was divided by genocide.
Rwanda’s success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
Kagame, however, has promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised to its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by intensifying fact-checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more to independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news distributors, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The subject has arisen in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election, and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that a fact check is being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t go through the screen of independent auditors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what to read and share,” Sara Su, Product Manager at Facebook News Feed, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottish Castle in Kent County is now known for its Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it, and now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who loved old documents.
“It’s great to be able to study a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago,” Rhodes says.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in a letter written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smelled like smoke because fire was used as lighting at the time.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!”
With the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, the writer, who was attracted to the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles that had been in the for centuries.
He walked around the ruins and premises of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes even artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings, he “made whiskey and began to write.”
The closer history of Scotland is quite unknown, as the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation’s staff were just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives had diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. “You could imagine that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says. “However, here families fought even from a single birch.
I thought I should let it be.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, which tells of a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, joins the English Peasant Cup in 1381.
“The book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
“The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the revolt could begin with rioting.
Maybe these events are connected?”
The rest of the book’s stories are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The men of the family seem to have been quite venomous. They constantly got into debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who were able to cook heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elänmäki, a sanatorium in the beginning of the 20th century that only left a lush plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this miserable day."
Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability in Russia’s eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said that NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump was able to find that the US-Russia relationship was even at a dangerously bad level.
Trump said he would like to thank the US Congress for its poor progress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko quits - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not happen
Vladimir Klitshko, the long-time world champion of the heavyweight professional boxing series, will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Klitshko took 69 times as a professional, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match,” Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko’s reasoning for his decision in the video.
Bernd B<0xC3><0xB6>nte, the manager of Klitshko, said in a statement that the termination decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr B<0xC3><0xB6>nte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, who was born in 2014.
Klichko’s older brother, Vitali, is also a former heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different alliances at the same time.
Finnish weatherbreaker picks up conditions: "Take a picture"
Minna Nikkanen, the pole jumper, has suffered from conditions during the summer’s outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman away from the mood.
The London World Cup also has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
This summer, the conditions have been a pole jumper against Minna Nikka.
“I don’t want to blame the race, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn’t get even the little ones to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve competed and practiced here no matter how many times and I’ve never experienced the same variable wind in this place,” Nikkanen told SpongeBob at Nurmi Games.
During this period, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in the Kaleva Games.
The weather was in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together – whether it’s a cold thing or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the vibe.
It makes no sense to consume energy in poor conditions.
He won the 455th World Cup.
We've gone 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday.
Why don’t you train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump and the technique was standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, I have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
A little wind will come, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-officer slammed politicians at Yle: “We have no room to distribute now or for many years.”
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep the ice in the hat and watch out for the expansion of the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed retired Virta in 2015 on Wednesday’s Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>saam.
The state budget for next year is about to start.
Recently, politicians' proposals on raising the guarantee pension, calculating the car tax and supporting electric bicycles have been thrown out, among other things, by Virtanen as an election speech.
They mainly tell us that the elections are starting to get close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about a distribution asset when debt is taken," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts are owed to children.
Virtas has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978, she started as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Budget Manager.
The last time he retired, he served as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the current forecast of 3% growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is the spike from which we will be going to the underpass next year, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase for decades.
Washington to change the rules of permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture Prince Henry and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
The Danish queen Margareta, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, are not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the couple of monarchs in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” Lene Belleby, the court’s communications chief, said in a statement.
The decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not treating the prince as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for burial and understands the decision.
A moment of terror on the road: The car had to come on the highway
Tom had an unmarried partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but do not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanporti in Vantaa.
Archive from the construction site of Kehä III.
Vantaan Tommi says her family survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her step-brother Riina and the couple’s two little children drove on the highway to Keimolanporti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From Kehä III’s connection to Hämeenlinnaväylä, a white car drove along the accelerator lane, which was to drive to the side of the family’s car, Tommi says.
Without the escape movement, the car would have come with Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the rails at a fast pace.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One child is slightly less than 3 years old, the other is less than 1 year old.
I guess it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
None of the passers-by even drove towards us, even though there was a busy traffic.
The accident happened around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue service staff were present and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says he and his partner have a small income, and they got a family allowance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of the other car, the family will not receive any money for insurance.
That's why the family wants eyewitness sightings of the car that drove the family to the rails.
We need a car every day.
“It’s hard to take children to the nursery and work without it,” Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He said the car registration number was the beginning of the SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that the police will be contacted if they see what happened or if they know anything about it.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night.
The title and the story were corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally said in the story, the other car did not come along with Tommi, but had to drive from the accelerator lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships through humor - The self-discovery will be seen at the Mih? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first directing to the What? theatre.
The self-discovery is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it is still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with through humor.
I don’t feel bad, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the circular summer theatre performance has been implemented with a long-range budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance challenges us to reflect on what a person reveals about himself when he meets a new person.
Is he going to play a role, or is he going to open another coat?
Unlined performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plot.
The director believes that although the presentation draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the self-discovery does not directly tell about his or her own or the working group’s relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own world of values will be conveyed by the performance.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I also do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-discovery draws a current picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you need to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The music adaptation is Jäppinen and Roka.
Love at the Theatre in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies theatre expression as a director at the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's two years in the back, and there's another bump in the front.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The student of music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at Linnatteri Theatre in Turku, among others.
Control has become more and more of an interest.
The self-discovery premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
In the future, a 45-minute presentation was also seen in Jäppinen’s study town in Turku.
Self-discovery at Kouvolan Mih? Theatre on 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers for a year from a terrible motocross accident - neckline fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtila.
The ace of kuparresund swirled the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased its dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahti’s movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of physical activity on the ground that Kemijärve would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There’s always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtila completely.
In 2014, Lahti was hit by a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working at all.
I was licking wounds in my home for a year,” says Lahtela.
There was bad luck in Lahti.
He also admits that age may have been a part of the disaster.
Driving on a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't get boundaries with it.
It’s just so hard as a sport that you shouldn’t overdo it too much!
After the accident, Lahtela got into a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the head coach of Japan’s freestyle team.
Lahtila started in the nest immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
“I didn’t do much,” he said.
During his training, Lahti often challenged his protection in the slope and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn’t seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it, because I just got to be.
An obligatory break inspired Lahti to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd burn out.
It is easier to find places that have been broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtila started as a freestyle team coach in Finland about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby instead of speeding.
I switched motocross to frisbee golf!
It just went out of my lap right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
While Lahtela has always been a super-interesting trainer, she doesn’t demand that her trainings be the same as hers.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture, there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtila says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It’s here: a report on technology development in the sex robot industry – just when it started to feel like 2017 can’t get any weirder.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
“We need to take the proliferation of sex robots seriously,” says Noel Sharkey, founder member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being hijacked, but they are already selling quite a lot, and we will see even more of them," Sharkey said at the report's announcement.
Sex Dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a warm-feeling silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What is even more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex cams have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, shy.
True Companion Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be, for example, tired, in the wind of conversation or "in that wind."
There are many worrying features in the proliferation of sex robots, which replace real human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when a user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be shy and resistant.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators. Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one of the alternatives.
Of course, most men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common, at a time when women’s rights have been threatened all over the world and there is a president in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most disturbing of its powerful image language, such as images of hanged bodies and outstretched eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
We try to make sex robots as much like real women (in terms of the proportions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They have neither their own will nor history—nothing that points to independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect that two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, led by ISIS chief
The head of the Islamic extremist group led a group of Australian men suspected of carrying a bomb on a plane operated by Etihad Airways.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the ISIS leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It is suspected that the bomb was scheduled to be taken on the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended prior to the security check.
The police will not tell you why the company was interrupted.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a full public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of the suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
The good side of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like a true picture of common sense
In the Trump era, it has been repeated until boredom that the strong divide between voters has also broken up families on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the U.S. Newspaper Advisory Forums provided guidance on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information bubble to burst.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to connect families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, and he's a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who's been a long time in a relationship with the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins—including the Republican-sponsored sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades—are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but, more broadly, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize right-wing Republicans, which suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember the sloppy version of Mitt Romney's slow version of madness: the dog on the roof of the car, the income tax of 14% (and we have seen his tax return), and compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump’s term is over, the Republicans’ next presidential candidate will just have to be clear-headed, and it will immediately feel like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park Carousel, the biggest carousel in New York Park and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
Karuselli’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle – the dirty clowns and the animals looking back in terror – are ominous, and the music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of the characteristics of New York will become disillusioned over time: the view of tall buildings begins to get bored, the silhouette of the city becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven’t gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t a Swiss cottage, but a big roundabout in northern London.
The carousel of the central park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-olds and two forty-something women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if anyone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reading device.
The same thing at the café with my home corners, but there I will also be given the opportunity to combine a 15% service fee with the estimate when I go to get a coffee from the counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the client to put their personality into play in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman of the department store smiled at me as I was tired of giving five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no trust in the management"
FC Inter has today released the Shefki Kuq team’s coaching team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously worked as an assistant coach, takes responsibility for training.
Other coaching teams will continue in their current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England, for example.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter’s coaching team, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets the incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so now there was no other option,” H<0xC3><0xA5>kans said in a statement.
The Piccareta agreement will remain in force until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he will be responsible for tomorrow’s home game against HIFK.
According to the evening-book reports, the team has been buzzing along Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club’s assistant coaches, Piccareta, and John Allen, had been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly joined Inter in the match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the 1980s - would you identify a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several puzzles have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about the young woman who looks at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A few years ago, he posted a picture of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius contemplates his own growth as a human and refers to the eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
“I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and how I look,” Lampenius wrote.
After the text, he had added English hashtags to life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
He was in the hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts in his wrists, which he was told by prison authorities after he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors complained about the original death sentence.
He killed Stenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The Prosecutor of the Kingdom intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be dealt with earlier this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped in Greece were arrested, according to the foreign ministry’s bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unlicensed campers in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing considerable fines on anyone who is camping in areas other than the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Neste's share sinks - already sunk -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste’s share has sunk by 7.7 per cent around 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes declined, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
Today, the stock exchange trade has started on the slightly cold side of the market, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
After the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had declined by 0.2 per cent.
The OMXH index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had decreased by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and the most traded companies had declined by 0.3 per cent.
The exchange’s total turnover was EUR 41 million, of which nine million was Neste, the morning’s result publisher.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
Marco Colonna, head of the study, said the immune cells were guarding the intestines and ensuring that the harmful microbes hiding in the food were not released into the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen the tolerability. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
In experiments, it was found that there are immune cells that strengthen tolerance in mice that have a specific bacterium in their gut.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to make the immune cells start to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more tryptophan was present in the mice’s diet, the more immune cells they had.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
When investigating immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiomes in the gut of mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the gut DNA of mice was studied, six types of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice without intestinal microbiome and without immune cells in a sterile environment, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance rose by about 50 percent. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerating cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria allow cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines,” Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation."
Jose Mourinho Says Manchester United Gets ‘Nero’ After Dealing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "neron" after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
With <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, Matic started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United's final match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, as he was not on a blue shirt tour in Asia before the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability,” Mourinho says.
“We’ll help him get ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to slice his initial formation for the start of the season.
This week, the Independent revealed that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "excellent job" by getting three of his four top-ranked players.
“Three out of four – you have to thank the club for that,” he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two seasons
The Finnish women's national volleyball team lost their fourth World Cup match to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The standard of play in Germany is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to swing along,” Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was the 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three games out of four will still be held in Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury Has Already Sent Challenges to Trump Jr.’s Russia Meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for Kremlin ties.
This is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information released by the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the convening of a large jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Veselnitskaya meeting, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House’s current advisor, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., means that the pace of Russian investigation is intensifying.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh up the evidence that the prosecutor investigated and decide whether the case should be prosecuted.
The British inventor microchips himself to get into his home and car with a swing of his hand
The British inventor is the first person in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now offering services to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq’s technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. The handling of one lock costs <0xC2><0xA3>300.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House Exhibit Costs Thousands of Dollars to Taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House to present American production had to cost taxpayers $24,000, according to the military documents received by TIME magazine.
The Green-White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the president is on board. It was a bet on the White House on 17 July 2017 at an event that showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials were introduced to the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter to be deployed only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as evidenced by the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
“I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because it’s an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” the commander of HMX-1 said in an email to his superior, an assistant commander of the Navy Flight.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 7 a.m. on 17 July and the event would begin at 3 p.m., and the helicopter would leave the site only after the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if a helicopter left the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed due to the limitations of service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME whether a second crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state assets for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was in violation of the law.
“One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was violated, and we were told not to break,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political hues.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed by the Senate at the time, as well as the looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels.
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcases American workers' products made of American materials from all 50 states," White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice bringing the president to the White House on the southern lawn.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 did 58 exercises for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
On that day, the unit’s helicopters also flew for 11 hours on “non-presidency support missions”.
According to the White House, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s spokesman said the company was not involved in a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to the duties of the President, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a report by RAND in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and to employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is absolutely appropriate to bring it up.”
It’s not certain if Trump was in a helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down on the fire truck driver’s seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical fault, the Rail Traffic Centre reports.

In the morning, the railway station had no estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela’s state prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the country from appointing a new representative council
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court order that would prevent the country from appointing a new representative body.
Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative body elected last Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, the country was elected by a representative council, which may, among other things, amend the constitution of the country.
Prosecutor General Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision had been requested due to election fraud suspicions.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges after a British company holding a representative council vote told him that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated, and the elected 545-member council includes among others Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the Representative Council may dissolve the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitutional reform to be Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they will not recognise the new representative body.
Maduro argues that the new Representative Council is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Several people have been injured and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela plunged into economic crisis as oil prices fell.
Now, many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate its position on Friday, when the new representative body is due to begin.
Russian man sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
The Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he returned home.
Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, news agency AFP said.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is deported after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry spoke harshly after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further direct the Internet traffic, which was used to create click-on scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Department of Justice, the case shows that the United States is capable of pursuing cybercriminals in other countries.
“We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected acquittal of the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali-cartel will be in the lead on Netflix's hit series
While Pablo Escobar’s killer was revealed in Narcos’ second season, Netflix’s series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons of the series will be seen. The third season trailer has been released and the new frogs of the series will be introduced.
During the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organization in the world.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that there is a little more corruption and violence in the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers for a war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola to perform an exceptional light art work in Paris
The Joensuun Light Artist Kari Kola (in Kuav) will carry out an exceptional light art work in honour of the first day of Light set by the UN in Paris next May 16.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illustrates the building of the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light, but also darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things that I feel important concretely visible,” says light artist Kari Kola in her work.
I am very pleased with the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of the Light in 2015, when he lit the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-enact my art to the UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first day of Light is celebrated at UNESCO Headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fighting in a shopping mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in Espoo at the Iso Omena parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when one of the parties accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver driving in a forbidden direction would wave the driver of another car, as a result of which this car would start moving in a collision with a hitter's car.
After that, he punched the crashed car into the bonnet.
In a preliminary speech, the man admitted that he had done the damage and that he had done the wrong thing.
Written by Timo Soini with a question mark: "After that came the Flood"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (v.) published a blog post on Thursday, which has been headlined with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the governing party of thirty-seven MPs.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the Flood analogy.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have left the connotations of "the Flood after us" or "the Flood after me".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, the head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Relief Mission, said that hundreds of women are nominated for the provincial council elections, three women seek to be vice-presidents, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan Regional Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have presented threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year’s elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contributions will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly targeted at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleece" tourism: the place is only a few hours away and is being rushed through a large number of sights.
Venice is stifled by quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems brought about by tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist volumes.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you will be given two or three hours.
You follow the ticketing guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square, and you turn back, describes the current and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of Venice's most popular places to visit.
St. Mark's Church is located on the outskirts of the square.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create the need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been envisaged for cruisers to go further from the historical center.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Every year around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving to Kuopio?
Motorway traffic jams for miles
On the north side of the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, from Thursday afternoon’s work to the time of return traffic, there have been several kilometres of traffic jams.
The area is undergoing motorway retreading, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of the usual speed of 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed at some point on Thursday afternoon, however, at practically a walking pace.
Some progressed on Thursday afternoon on the shore of Siilinjärvi near the Statue of Revelation, or golden oats.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner must have noticed the curse of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published some great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon scenery, for example.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country, Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre race in March by touring the circuit at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-meter hurdles at the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, a hard-working social media user, discovered that fame and publicity had a downside.
Men from all over the world began to send images of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I got a lot of "cracks" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one, Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he was getting.
You can probably guess, Iuel was laughing.
It’s nice to get feedback after the race, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, his family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
He spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask for anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally,” Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korve at risk for his entire career - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It's been nice to count when you haven't hurt anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has really enjoyed his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, my career was at stake.
The foot injury had forced Korvi to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to heal at all.
His hand had hit the race.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was doing, whether I was going to go on or not.
The Sponsored Links were broken and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, it's the way things work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again on the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, damn it, this is so much fun again, let's go for a couple more days.
Korpi was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long countdown, training without pain has been a big deal.
Only a few have been around.
It doesn't matter.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of snowboarding for Korvelle.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're on the verge of fever that week.
I can’t think that way, Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the Halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though the individual races don’t like him on the board, he always lights up with the fierce competition.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
In Sierra Nevada, Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland’s 12-strong team.
The team’s pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to see younger friends.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and I was so excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to yourself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the slope, but otherwise I don't, there's a lot of power in my friends!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the lead legend Pekka Korve is addicted to health sports: the boarder has his own horses for which he makes training programs.
When I travel all the time, there is no more time to be at the fair.
But every day I watch at least the results of the treatment and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, treatment management and training is a potential career plan when the board career comes to an end in time.
I don’t plan to go that far, but it’s a likely option.
I feel like I’m a little bit like I’m studying it here alongside snowboarding.
I try to stay on top of the time and develop, maybe in the summer I’ll be driving some kind of departures.
If it's my future profession, then it won't be difficult to start when you're already inside the sport.
Treatments also include the Elitloppet cruise with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet treatment competition at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone very well, and people have been excited.
We are at a point where there will be no bankruptcy.
We still have a few months to complete the ship,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat nursing home for the elderly to be built for Kitee.
The 1,700-storey building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbouring Terveystie.
The general theme of the crystal puzzle is what makes the new treatment unit sufficient for customers, because now during the Siun wars many private care homes are causing customer shortages.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Nursing Services, commented that in the future, Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, the freedom of choice also works better,” Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction involved a business, but there is a five-year lease agreement on the properties.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions out of these spaces.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union seeks confirmation from the McVitie's biscuit manufacturer's executives of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Department of the General Union of the United Kingdom, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, a company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will "be sure to be the first to be told" if there are any changes to the operations.
In a letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company "to respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB professional association, finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager is not clear about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
"The families have been working here from generation to generation, and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as the continued reduction of Brexit, rising living costs and production, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs a successful McVitie’s production.”
According to Pladis’s spokesperson, the head of the factory had received a letter from the trade union only the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it values continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and improvement of operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production facility and will be sure to be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are going to make any changes to the operations of the factory.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after paying <0xC2><0xA3> 189 million for the termination of the contract, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked about in the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of migrations. The previous record was less than half the size: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the move, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive football player and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG’s activities and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona tells us that the club has been taking great care of Neymar ever since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they want our players, we’ll become their opponents and contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they seek our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have done just that: it expressed its interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italy to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.
Neste halted the rise of the stock exchange - Stock exchange news - Ilta-Sanomat
Metsä Board, the second major publicist of the day, is on the downside.
The European general index Stoxx 600 increased by 0.1 per cent when Helsinki closed.
The OMXH index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange rose by 0.1 per cent to 9542.08 points.
The most traded companies in the OMXH25 went the same way.
The stock exchange’s total turnover amounted to EUR 469 million, of which 67 million were Nokia and 59 million were Neste’s early-morning results.
In the gear shift, Nokia increased by 0.3 per cent to 5.51 euros.
The next oil refiner, Neste, packed 5.1 percent.
The company's profit before taxes declined, but exceeded the forecasts.
In turn, turnover rose above forecasts.
In particular, sales volumes of renewable products increased.

Trump’s phone calls were invented – White House spokesman: “I wouldn’t say it was a lie.”
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump’s smoking calls with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the Scout Organization have proven to be inventive.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said Trump didn’t lie.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn’t just happen on the phone, they happened face-to-face,” Sanders said.
The speech to the scouts provoked disapproval.
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump for fighting illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that the journey will in any case make the U.S. border worse.
The Mexican government issued a statement Wednesday saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the party said it was not aware of any of its leaders speaking to Trump.
According to a statement made earlier by Michael Surbaugh, director of the organization, in which he apologized to the scouts for Trump’s speech.
Trump’s speech at the Scouts’ Conference was a great surprise, for it was exceptionally political in view of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he inspired the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
