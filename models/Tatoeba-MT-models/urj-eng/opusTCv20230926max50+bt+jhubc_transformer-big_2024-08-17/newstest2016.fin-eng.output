A 9-year-old boy who escaped from Tampere was found.
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy’s escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk for life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomi at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start a follow-up investigation.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, my father told me.
Ronaldo once again broke the finish line at Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and continued to work in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal-winner turned at least for a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the all-time goal scorer statistics when he shot a visitor to the network of Shahtar Donetsk with two shots of penalty kicks and one of the game’s situations.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was leveling with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has been compulsorily compulsive in the Italian football league Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League D-block, he started strong with a 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Alvaro Morata of Juventus about ten minutes before the end.
The city's attack was tedious by the absence of the knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's Premier League game, came to the field with only the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also suffered severe defeats in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2-loss.
ManU's 20-year-old quarterback Luke Shaw's guest game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking glider hit the manu pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg bone.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff went to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 line in 41 minutes, but the pleasure of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno flattened before the break with extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League started the A-block in Paris Saint-Germain.
It was replaced by Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who replaced Manchester United's shirt with PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back corner of Malm<0xC3><0xB6> by Johan Wiland, goalkeeper.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the season’s success stories.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, which is part of the league's long-distance league, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met his professional team Malm<0xC3><0xB6> FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes, when his team, Moscow's TsKA, lost the B-block in a game in Germany for Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for an immediate resignation - the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full power of spirit.
The main opposition party MDC called for Mugabe to resign because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hastened to say that the confusion had occurred only on Mugabe's staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, who will lead the summits, will assess the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe more effective in registering.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a university teacher with only a bit of color, tells the police during an emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of close relatives of the dead woman can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the side of the whistle: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this beloved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said a letter that, according to experts, was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, said the university staff heard about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He said Lambi made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police were encircled by the mob.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motive the day after the students and staff had had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described the Lamb as a gifted teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for his classes.
The police at the site of Prentiss’ death, Gautier, said Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised the Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, “as if something had been wrong.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested a sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s salary principles meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral degree, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University Principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, police were able to track him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were melted wax when she was there, now told 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river bank in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Shawn O'Steen, a former husband of Prentiss, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room near Gautier, says he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night, on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harp performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were playing games and throwing squats at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school’s English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, Cleveland, there was a candle-shattering event attended by some 900 people, including teaching staff and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the fair, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagner Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the police saying that Lamb now made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn’t hire as many employees for a holiday as last year, but the retailer of toy and baby products says that today’s regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, while the number of employees in the 2014 holiday season was 45,000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
While there are months of vacation time, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of stores, as well as in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox makes jokes about his "treme" with Princess Diana
Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in a forthcoming documentary on Back in Time’s trailer.
The film starts and reminds me that I'm just a tehakusu and a hand stretching away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Returning to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie of all time.”
Back in Time is available as an on-demand video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN President Says Syria Will Not Be Armedly Solved
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “will not be solved militarily,” and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations in order to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he was going to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
In addressing the Syrian crisis, Ban urged five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus that they demonstrated when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Survey Results That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to label him as a windmill.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to silence Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been in the lead in a two-digit century, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means for the real estate king’s nomination opportunities.
The election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leading position to the emerging Herman Cain, both of whom did not get back any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization’s Club for Growth have noted Trump’s persistence and have begun to use their funds to defeat him.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing step:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a full turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also valid in the first pre-electoral states.
In a support poll conducted by the University of Quinnimarket in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “reasoned” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "excited" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be “unsatisfied” or “reasoned” if Jeb Bush, a favorite of the ruling powers, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday, 52 percent of Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has a character that suits the president.
According to a survey conducted last week in Quinn Market, the figure in the state of Iowa, which hosts the first party meeting, is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten people thought Trump was the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
At this time, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were in favor of another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as Trump’s support is divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral competition between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with every 33 points.
He's on a level with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump-sponsored voters have decided who their vote is going to be.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that they will never change their mind.
46% said they could change their candidate.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “racists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s power is driving Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harming rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support from Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll on Monday that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll on Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “unsatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn’s first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time in a prime minister’s poll.
Corbyn asks about his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs watched closely his performance.
Corbyn has called for “less theatre and more facts” for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour Party leader to stand silent during the national anthem during the Tuesday memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain Air War, has sparked criticism among the Conservative Party MPs and has appeared on several front page stories.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he "revealed his stand with respect" and that he acknowledged "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Corbyn’s shadow government member, Owen Smith, told BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour Party leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he felt that the King’s House should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs; initially less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in line with the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have "accumulated" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party was proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government’s secretary of labour and pension, said the party was “very clear” about their opposition to government plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "enforced" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, Member of Parliament for the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the prime minister’s Question Time is too contrasting and that he intends to refrain from both clever speech and tinkering, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government’s finance secretary, will replace her during Question Time when Corbyn does not attend – for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercowi.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often associated with Prime Minister’s Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since the beginning of television broadcasting in 1990, the prime minister’s Question Time has been an important measure of assessing the director’s judgment, his lower room management, and his position with other MPs, although critics have criticised the Question Hours for becoming just a mockery that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound rises as wage growth in the UK accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The pace of growth was the fastest since 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in courses.
Punta rose from over one percent to 1.5505 dollars, and from 0.84 percent to 1.3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index closed down to 6229.21 with a 1.49% increase.
SABMiller was the most prominent share on the market and rose by 20 per cent after its competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would unite the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from the rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5% after the mining giant reported it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to "sell" the company.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced a six-month increase in revenue before taxes: an increase of 83 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages May Harm Enlargement
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be targeted at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building IGA brands through mainstream and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough offer tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this wholesale distributor of food, alcohol and hardware will host an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia make up almost 30% of the Metcash IGA trade area, with higher profit margins than Metcash’s Eastern Länder IGA network.
Visitors to South and Western Australia’s purchases are known to be in the corner, and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 % in the south and 24 % in the west compared to 14 % in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, resulting in turnover from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million in sales each year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating $500 million and $600 million in revenue in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash’s high fixed costs base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were among the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016; by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, with its market share falling from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
On a business lunch in Melbourne, Hamish Douglass, manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said Metcash could “very possibly disappear in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to around 1,200 IGA distributors, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler keeps his side, and has invested more than $150 million each year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths weekly, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, says that price reductions and improved stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis federation chairman Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of her behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a minor in the recent storm that has raged around her friend Nick Kyrgios, and she deserves more honor than criticism for her own behavior, says Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented twin called "Special Ks", was unwittingly exposed in a case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after that, in a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge was forced twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
While Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory for Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the trash," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberra to the team's stability.
“We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all the polemics around [Cyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye to reflect on these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of impeding the influx of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in an unbiased area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence in their countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on the road between the inspection stations of the two countries for an indefinite period.
However, frustration has increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the riot police in Hungary.
Some refused food and water for protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister declared that it is “impossible to accept” the return of migrants from Hungary as they receive more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The mixed population at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of 40,000 asylum-seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who spoke with hope about the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to intervene in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the largest entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are in search of a better life for economic refugees, and not for those fleeing the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares an emergency,” Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for the government, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the expected military deployment next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have been seeing for days heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban’s home security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 more countries.
They got over it by damaging the fence, are now being imprisoned by the police, and they are being charged with violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border with Serbia after they had sent a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these stops.
The main border crossing near Roshkea in Hungary was covered with chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds were pushing in.
About 20 were allowed in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they will refuse food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed down
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue as a two-digit leader in the Democratic nomination competition, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be arrested.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democrats (down from 58%), and Sanders, who is second, is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will take part in the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the pre-electoral elections, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say that they have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their own choices more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity among several population groups has declined since last month’s CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s head start in Democrats under 50 has been lost, and she’s now on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the Democrats in the country say they will support Clinton enthusiastically if she becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democrats say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican top man Donald Trump says the same thing with fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had appropriate experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President will influence a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democrats would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagree.
When asked who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden leaves, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most to vote for has increased.
When asked what was most important about the candidate, the Democratic electorate raised the opinion above the voter turnout.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is best at being honest with the trio, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30% of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally agree that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all of these issues, about a quarter of Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server as Secretary of State still raises questions, the majority of Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and say that the issue did not affect their general opinion about her.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
In March, people’s opinions were divided shortly after it came to light.
The majority of Americans say that email polling did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton’s own party voters consider her honest and reliable, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider her honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don’t consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many people have no opinion about him, just like Carson.
The error margin in the study, which involved 351 Democrats, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In a new poll, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from the 23% of last month’s CBS poll published on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, Carson rose sharply from six percent to 23 percent.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is being marginalized by Trump’s higher education Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s support has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third in 6 percent.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey carried out in September is +/- 6 %.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32 percent.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was much ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s popularity rising last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on his campaign visit to Iowa last Saturday.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College’s First-Year Student
Almost two years after the student died at a fraternity chimping ceremony in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his admission to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
The authorities say Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a backpack of over 13 kilos of sand, after which he was repeatedly beaten to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field toward the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the fraternity’s national president, Andy Mengi, asking for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and in practice put the Brotherhood's well-being ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blunt object on the head, body and thigh.
“Too many families have suffered fraternal ligation when at least one student has died every year since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
A large jury in Monroe County voted in favour of the first five members being charged with a third-degree murder.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent mutilation and criminal plotting.
“We don’t want to be held accountable just for individuals, and if there is an organisation behind the incident that either formally or informally accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity dismantled its connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates
The interest rate level will increase, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise, and the economy will be in recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take for all of this to take or how long it will take.
The past is hardly helpful in terms of timing, especially in terms of the economy.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first draw, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The US central bank’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Central Bank officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the development of time to normalize the situation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the interest-rate-related incentives have been over-dimensioned.
“The central bank’s first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the ‘bad money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief economic expert in global affairs at Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, will be a revolutionary shock that many people seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some aspects of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As the market has seen in the last about a month, waiting for the interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last approximately 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14 percent when approaching the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the leading capital strategist at Nuve’s Asset Management company, published in Barron’s magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns start to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case with gross domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest level ever before the central bank raised interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
While in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The raising of interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared to increase the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that, since 1950, all booster cycles have so far been experiencing an increasing leverage effect in super cycles where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery has begun," the report said.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been expecting by far the end of the last recession: a record of 35 months, and now the 74th month is already in progress.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market is waiting for the raising of interest, and the model is somewhat similar to the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, its effects are reflected more quickly in debt securities than in shares.
The direction of the yield on the bonds appears to change immediately at the first increase/surge of the cycle.
At the end of the boom cycle, the yield on bonds will drop immediately,” Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a convergence of yields on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in a situation like this, although “we are still cautious about looking for returns,” said Schwab’s fixed yield analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
“In addition to the dollar’s strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies with businesses located mainly in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have in finance.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares tend to be more profitable in the three months after the first raise,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer-oriented report.
Companies with strong net sales exceeded weak net sales by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Velasta is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham said.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "citizenship"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes more and more difficult
He also took on the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it was not original.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding to the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on its "citizenship" content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term 'citizenship' - is turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also starred in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only seem to have been held under different names by the British Awards.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can directly remember when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC president denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of live music and information sharing for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first class.
“In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not in any way original?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 channel program, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced “in the style of the BBC.”
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of the upcoming The Voice seasons, or to order that the money of the licensees be used in other entertainment formats.
Online sales up the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the increase was the lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, a JMRG sales index supplier, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales became stronger when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it levels, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will stop making purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to pick up the shops, knocking down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which made buyers argue about the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Mecca’s crane accident, sanctions against Bin Laden’s family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during their first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia accuses Saudi Binladin Group of collapse
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried across the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Mainly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad passage passed through the holy place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and overthrew the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king confirmed that the Bin Laden family was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the 29 bodies of worshipers killed in the Great Mosque of Mecca, 29 were carried across the street.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already vowed to continue their journey to Mecca as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the fall of the cranes in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage to be held later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications about the collapse of the misery and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mecca Grand Mosque, which are part of the massive construction raid led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix trades for professionals will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, City Editor-in-Chief for Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up their hammers and paintballs and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do housework.
It seems that if you are clever with a hammer or start painting walls, you are now in a minority.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the popularity is driven by the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work at B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store are made specifically by the prettiest sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households where more domestic work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women who lead the UK’s FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt his management team to equal numbers of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with exactly 50 percent women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both revenue and sales for six months after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of Trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three Aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to be forced immediately, and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread protests of the workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Ask if it’s worth the strike when it’s bad anyway.
There has even been a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already reported online that they do not intend to take part in the demonstration but go to work.
In the old age of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people does not take much time, but it is the cause of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the operations of the Ay movement, the government’s rigid solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll with their own weight for years, the unions are finally able to defend the rights of the employee, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to consolidate the role of the ay movement, when membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever we think of the activities of the organizations, it is nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta is facing a tough cost-cutting challenge: With a goal of 8.5 million savings, personnel will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings course with the aim of cutting costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on the entire staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means a reduction of approximately 130 employees.
A further two million will be saved from the rest.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8.5 million in actual operations.
This is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Spending will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the University is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research, as well as the reduction in corporate funding, on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli, in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the Trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of Onnibus, British company Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to open up gradually to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After the commuter traffic, the turn is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, Onnibus’ plans are welcomed at the Ministry of Transport.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport from other international companies, which also has bus services in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who thought last week that the central bank was raising interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is a historic event, as the central bank has cut interest rates to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get off the zero level and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought into the balance sheet trillions of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to raise, but the signs also show that they believe the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apologizing Message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," officials said on Tuesday.
Mississippi’s Gautier police said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send officers to his house.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “close dog” in the house that “does not disturb anyone” but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message from 45-year-old Lamb saying, “I’m so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when police surrounded him.
University Principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite Monday's claims that Lamb had believed that Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "law of knowledge or evidence" of any kind of "three-dimensional drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
O'Steen said that Prentiss and his daughters were "one of the best friends ever."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online, and Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday to tell them, “He’s not going to jail.”
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there, and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a CV found on the university’s website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United’s Luke Shaw is out for months due to double-crossing
Luke Shaw broke his right leg when Manchester United lost PSV to Eindhoven in the Champions League game.
While the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle on the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had plunged into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe a day after, and then he'll be cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and this is what happens now.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian agent was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw and loses to PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this heavy, because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's backlash.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than that, right?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before it learns almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by the prime minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, a 1971 environmental story.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or message we’ve never seen before.”
All this is true, but the next song, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 movie version, where new characters and details were added to fill a fairly short original text.
“In the city of Tarvill inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win over his dream girl’s heart by fulfilling Audrey’s wish to see the right tree,” the text says and describes the love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, the real name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If that’s not yet suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds like it’s taken from a plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: “In a city inside the Walls where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams over the heart of Audrey’s girl.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so uninformed about the plot of the book. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed the greedy, wood-cutting and weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, succulent creature named Lorax, who "talks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
Prime Minister’s spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron’s district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined by the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think it’s likely that the last 3-0 serial loss will happen again.
I wouldn't close a guest win off the bills.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it’s accompanied by good spinrs and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth drops out of England's cricket team, replaces Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is obviously difficult to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are criticized for their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best decision makers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there's a second chance.
English coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, including Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and abroad.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a punch opening next to Cook has been balled up, which would give the pitch an extra pitcher but would keep four fast ones, and I am not against that.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games when the first dandruff dropped before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a substitute for the team, and, the little I've been dealing with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unscrupulous statistics - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's gambling, but there aren't too many pitchers on offer and voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mchael Jayawardene as a consultant to the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the white ball games and brings both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be a part of an international cricket, whether it’s gaming or coaching, and he’s got the same exploitable ace he’s got.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is laid off for one-days, Root was given a similar break from Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, the coaches and the selectors don’t make the schedule.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Britain’s exit from the EU (Brexit) may take a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's semi-quiet renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems every day, even if the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the Labour Party leader or to the trade union central organization's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragens.
A European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the British self-centred agenda, which is full of concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which these countries do not want to do most of the time.
At his annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them if they were to undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agent.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without a local eyewitness, and then come home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the UK's EU tent - "Do not leave us alone with France", says from Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they do not care that we are leaving.
Germany’s cautious and moderate Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her job before it gets ruined in the same way as it did to Thatcher who stayed too long (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves on behalf of the SelfieBritts, when their energy would rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 UK Referendum Campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"Re-negotiations were arranged" and "Re-negotiations were of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press’s autocracy is, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was strengthened by a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about "the EU's direct bananas" as Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a large number of tax-extinguishing strangers, phone hackers, and people whose registered office is elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought of them the same way, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of treachery, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more clairvoyant than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly clapped me in the back at Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but no doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He said he would like us to stay in a renewed Europe.
Well, the majority of people outside Ukipi’s campaign enthusiasm and the most fierce nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this both on radio and on TV this week when his inner scouts would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's election to be the harshly-described John McDonnell shadow government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70’s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party’s government without going so far as to lose his seat.
Hilary's efforts were more attractive.
But the struggle to keep up with "any situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor, on the whole, what Corbyn told the principals and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the 24-hour TV era, and especially in the social media vortexes, which is an ideal breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and, in line with their Benn-spiritual regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation with leftist thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central dogma of dogma in doctrinal mockery.
When it comes to his divisiveness with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have dubious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticise Public Health England’s E-cigarette Assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that electricity subsidies are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lancet on the evidence used by critics of Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published this "pillar" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet published an editorial that attacked the PHE's main decision against the "exceptional hutera base".
Two other researchers at BMJ have wondered whether the claims were “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that practices must be based on proven efficacy.”
They say that the public is waiting for the PHE's claim that "currently, according to the best estimate, electric tubes are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobaccos" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one 12-person meeting where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their views on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reportedly previously receiving funding for an independent investigation by the American Tobacco Company.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was told to have received from a former tobacco company, Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report having received funding in the field of research.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of PHE.
The group’s research “manyly admits” that there is a lack of “controversial evidence about harm to most of the products and most of the criteria,” writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “to date, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to burning children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made at BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die from smoking-related illness every year, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
Explaining the current evidence - that is to say, even if the power poles are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibilities.
The BBC should step down from EastEnders, former Channel 4 leader said.
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would “give anything” from hits such as this soap show on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, at difficult broadcast times against the most watched programs of competitors, and on channels such as the BBC4.
After the BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC for nothing.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that are clearly suitable for unsubsidized competitors,” Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is kept - and I am not sure that would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the main broadcast time, because it wants to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be funded even without state subsidies.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders is the other, undoubtedly implemented inside the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about public service broadcasting.
I don’t think that would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is “involved in hunting audiences because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC’s smaller public service programs “go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then, while defending the <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in concession revenue, hypocritically state that ‘of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching’.”
They'll put them at a mission no one's ever going to look at them.
Johnson said to the committee, “I ask you to look for a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year will get a lot of value, but I don’t know if that’s true for the people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is big money because they don’t use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith mission to “encourage, educate and entertain.”
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education — he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio — and that it should take a model from Australian and Canadian radio stations and transform the mission into “information, education and entertainment.”
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which, he says, are only being shown on TV by some people, and to ally with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
"Voice genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the shuttle pigeons change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound wave bursts.
Tiny shuttle pigeons change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure that conducts electrical impulses into the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttle pigeons normally do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that bubbles strengthened the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonically controlled shuttle pigeons, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound in modified worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they turned on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off by using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along optical fiber to the desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make the target human nerve cells temporarily react to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements put Britain’s arms trade in shame
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapons video.
Terrible killer machines!
The ankle-shrinking leggings!
Grape bombs!
As well as electronic stunners that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
There is no doubt that this advertisement of the world’s largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to underline the willingness of the British government to trade arms with oppressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in London.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared for bus stops and metro trains, which required a closer look.
"The important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked together using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... Customers will be asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at Banksy's Museum of Cruel Designs in Dismaland.
The Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" package, a six-pound pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, "accesses a third of the advertising space for bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not interested in this unlicensed "poster vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Curator of Cruel Designs and Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists on the resistance front when they realize that they need to go outside if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook more than 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background reviewer worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was a blank point in ExCeL's calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but "it was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
“They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair,” said Amnesty International’s Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when exhibitors trade fantastically decorated products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the U.S. military for “the AT4CS RS, launched from the ground up.”
This includes "a unique pipe-pushing tip that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student residence
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student residence at the age of 19, when I didn't know about it, and then I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the obsessive smiles of the people I irritated - and the numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from a nerve to a completely scary one.
It’s tempting to spin around: tell me where you’re from, whether you’ve had a mid-year and where you’re thinking about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just a yeast extract HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA I find in my room.”
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not the people you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’d share the extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and mainstream entertainment venues, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.

Your room should be a place of rest, but for many dormitories, a culture of walking from room to room is formed, which is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you need to leave now so I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
When it comes to knocking, knock.
A guy in my student dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start university in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate baking plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less “Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from a 50’s student.
Providing self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and it may be that in the future they will combine your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on your ability to bake.
Poorly blended flour-sugar-fat-beds are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adult than my housemate, who mixed up his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noises so that people are not allowed to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot playing the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was three o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before she put her own music on the line, locked her door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or, in reverse, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, would join, split up, and then see her every day and possibly lose all your common friends to her.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk sense to your lower head.
In that ravishing moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between cheating and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it can be canceled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling like no more than twice.
Racist attack on the property of foreign students in Kitee - House planned as a reception centre was grounded in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the property of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not accommodation for asylum seekers underage, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Kite Evangelical Folk Institute.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the People’s University were stained with racist signs, such as hawks, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation rooms, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible teacher of youth social guarantee training at the National Academy of Sciences, the building under defamation had an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The People's College has people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has an a-status.
Some of them study at an adult elementary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time for four years at a time.
Police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of injury and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkanen, an information meeting was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” says Luukkainen.
According to Luukkanen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected to have been involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend night, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that,” Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been hospitalized in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
It was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had a hammer drawn and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report has been made.
Correction of incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state is shutting down the Y-train to Karjaa - the passengers are starving, "just idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news angered the passengers arriving at the start of the train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the downing strikes the Siuntians, said Torbj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m, who lives in the municipality.
It’s completely idiotic because the population is growing and the people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't depend on anything but political will or lack of it.
In an interview with HSTV, Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m says that he will come to the capital even with a tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be combined into the new R-line.
Purola’s position in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry will purchase rail transport during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there will be routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m, a Siuntioan, believes that the state’s train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes the remorse.
The Y-train is also used by non-Raasepori and Siuntio because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina P<0xC3><0xB6>yryä from Espoo was upset by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to re-plan their journey,” he said as he struggled with the Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection that will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, which will take you to Kirkkonummi.
This will lead to additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to find out the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y-train, of course the ministry has paid a lot more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train crossings is doubled.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services are reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made with stop-over shifts per year, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises in the global economy have brought Karl Marx’s (1818-1883) and his final work Capital published between 1867 and 1894 to the surface, writes Yrj<0xC3><0xB6> Hakanen, a former president of GDP, in a book published today about the topicality of Marx’s Capital.
“He is now being taken more seriously than for a long time,” Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and intrusion into all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakanen also includes Professor of Aalto University, esteemed economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is “now and forever.”
But isn’t the former CEO of the Finnish Institute of Economic Research and the Finnish Delegation for Economic Affairs a Marxist?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx to be a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the initial stage of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are being discussed again.
"Marx may be able to inspire someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical upheaval," Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, in the opinion of Korkman, Marx is worth studying.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
“Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other.”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the past few years.
“Every social scientist should get to know Marx’s thinking – just like other classics,” Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a Special Court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, AFP said.
The United Nations report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
Sri Lanka’s civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no exact information on the number of victims.
Especially in the last months of the long war, the great attack by the armed forces in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims as men and women.
According to the report, the insurgents have been guilty of coercing bystanders and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied Wednesday that it was going to conduct the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
English yo-test gets pounded on social media
On Wednesday, the student books of the autumn included a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 English students tested their English skills.
You could write about it on social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250-word article in English could be addressed to the editor of the online magazine’s advisory forum.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leelia resting chair.
She had to ask her parents how to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking high school in Porvoo.
The third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least our school has been practicing writing speeches,” Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment to be “almost normal.”
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, contributed to the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn papers will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish or Swedish exam will take place.
In high school, the test is held normally, i.e. the protest of the employees does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board urges the experimenters to find suitable transport connections in time for the test session.
You can also have additional time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Store threatened with gun theft in Oulu
On Wednesday morning a shop was robbed in the City of Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
According to police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s decision to cut will be blocked in central Helsinki on Friday, the police forecast.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK alliances will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out emergency tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the demonstration of the giant mind.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30 am to 14 pm.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the direction of the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, it seems that enough is enough.
I don't take a stand on the police's work-fighting issues.
According to Kujala, support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the protest.
The police don't tell you the exact patrol.
“There’s a lot coming, but as a rule, we’ll be fine on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are calling for private cars to be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic trick extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
You can expect to see traffic from the morning to the beginning.
With the arrival of demonstrators from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed in the railway station.
The buses are pretty far away.
Then you have to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The protest also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to run smoothly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are sensible and peaceful people,” says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday’s demonstration is exceptional in many ways – do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good reference point in Finnish political history,” says Emeritus Martti Siisiinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement is protesting.
If it didn’t, it would raise hands in front of the government,” Siisinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism – and also at those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s harsh stances are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features of the fact that the ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division of the protest among those whose ay movement would like to participate in the protest.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland showed their views at the Parliament Building in November 1993.
“If you’re looking for a benchmark for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed,” says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (central) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as they had been during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than it was at Murrostorsta.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland has ever been in power,” Siisinen says.
The current coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing, despite the speeches of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old working-class movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected to be present on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-care centres and schools.
Even if the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're all over it.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful - even though the methods of action have intensified in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on top of them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Category: 1970s metal and electrical strikes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric strike in 1977.
The metal men's strike was attended by 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16 percent salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, the power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Breaking Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many of whom had been made unemployed by the recession, to express their views on work.
Firefighters strike three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, when farmers protested against the EU, police were caught in an egg rain.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the slogans.
The farmers of Espalla had ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened the strike and the carers' mass deportations in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors Striked in 2001
"Doctors on strike - from necessity", was the slogan of the strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliament House in 2013.
Central Criminal Police investigates the background of a refugee-filled Finnish truck to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee lorry registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim, near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck might have been on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the venue in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first told about cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain who beats refugees, a former drug lord and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A stubborn king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a self-respecting taxi driver.
Such people, for example, carry out the smuggling of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola from Trenton University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human trafficking, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer entertainment.
For its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
This is what Emir has done hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns approximately EUR 8,000.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis again erupted.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is given so that the customers just and only stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
Let's go to the water at midnight with the extinguished lantern.
On the first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for his return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least claims to beat the loudspeakers to death.
In the book, he says that when the police once threatened him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
“I caught customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
His fellow countrymen are said to be assaulting him on this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
We need to show them who's in charge here right away.
Just an ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogota, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south-west of Belgrade.
Next to the village there is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed.
In the forests around the city centre, men travelling without their families stay in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private homes, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often lope weary - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive at the Bogova<0xC5><0xA1>a area, the great hub of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's drivers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
A fool's a fool all the way.
First, the price is set at 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I’m just doing my job and helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and only charges 50 euros per person for the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most of the comfort of the motorway.
I have heard that colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a pretty nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his cynics a mile from the border.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and cheers off.
At Work of Compassion
35-year-old Congolaism is called Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many Congolese believers flee, as well as a small centre for helping Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary is running a smuggling business where people are being transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white squids peeks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
First, the customer calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in a squeaky way, and sneaking into the shops that cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from areas such as the Northern Kivu war zones and that they have had to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and replaced with another.
It helps Missionary contacts with Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The ambassador knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: the application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country of EUR 4 500-7000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, a former drug lord.
A four-year-old Irishman is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they are in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near Calais city centre.
They drive the A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison to arrange illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting there for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs his customers across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they continue across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on its way to England, not the Netherlands, for example - and cuts through the safety wire of the protective cover.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the noise is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in an aluminum foil, similar to the one wrapped around a fryer or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's thermal scanner from detecting a hidden person.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene hoping that the driver will not be able to sneak into the car before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k is one of the world’s most famous traffickers.
Upporic Turks have been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, ruling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k has been operating since the 1990s and has been continuously developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury ferry scam: Turkish ports are rented out for pleasure yachts to take to tourist cruises that are comfortable for American or European families for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe by sea for a fee of between 5,000 and 7,000 euros.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are smothered into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you need to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep their entire journey hidden under the deck.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers excrete and vomit, the better.
K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k receives approximately 53,000 euros from one luxury boat trip after expenses.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k makes millions.
He is believed to have bought land through covert companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by the 1,500-metre runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top of the race and ran for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top in the beginning and defended his lead in a manic race.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with foreign men.
He also oversaw his husband’s acceptance of his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s becoming a prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had when he competed in athletics.
It was later revealed to Favor Hamilton that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner came to light at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton took part in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was the world's top statistician at 1500 metres (3.57.40 ft) but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The World Champion was delighted when the alliance put the Norwegian ski flower under control: "Straight-backed"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of fitness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the sports contract for the whole summer and autumn, as they did last year.
While the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not qualified for multiple world champions and Olympic champions.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by two world champions, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski flower under control.
“Thank you for pointing out your spine,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the Federation,” he added.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wanted to be part of the season's national team so he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also take care of future generations and not give one athlete a solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance had granted Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug released a statement in which he said he wanted to compete in Norwegian colours in the World Cup next season as well as in the World Cup and Olympic Games after that.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals, two of which were gold medals.
He was in the team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
The roasters’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the 25th of September, there will be sweepstakes at various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Pastry Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it should be pointed out that not all high-quality restaurants have focused on the Helsinki metropolitan area, but top restaurants that have been inspected and rated by a neutral operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondiks and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town is taking part in the day of the race.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organization, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-stock currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region is still permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Finnish Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Aviation War School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre.
In the case of Kauhava airport, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a possible foreign operator to the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> (ps.) and Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of a principled opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> commented to journalists in his evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties in his residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, the concern for managing the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us.
According to Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tension with the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, the issue of NATO was also ignored in the discussions.
The President did not take a stand on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia is told that the operations of airports are to be carried out by the management forces during the stoppage.
However, delays and delays can be expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday closes the streets of Helsinki city centre.
Police say the streets leading to the railway station will be closed from cars around 9.30 am to 4 pm.
From the direction of the Mannerheimintie cars are not allowed in Kaivokatu, Postikatu or T<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xB6>nlahti street towards the railway station.
From Union Street to Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles shall be allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers during the whole Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday’s demonstration from morning to night.
The association of tram and metro personnel told STT this evening.
Most of the originals close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday’s protest also disrupts Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected in the delivery of daily mail, for example.
The majority of postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
Food transport, hospital deliveries and laboratory samples are also being handled.
You can find information about the services on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Beginners will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The trade union of service industries Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 a.m.
Pam has also called on workers in the grocery trade to take part in the protests of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with the help of supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual trades.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
The day care centres in Helsinki do not operate fully on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the protests of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
The 24-hour day care centres and groups of children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of children with intellectual disabilities and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The National Agency for Early Childhood Education promises to inform more about the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels of communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one of the channels among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be communicated on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
This channel is being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio to be spoken to the public.
This dossier, which we are talking about, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä explained.
The call will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yle Arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television talk will not tell about a more general government’s introversion.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and to refuse to put the public debate into question? asks Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
The Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is angry at Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media did not react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not a matter of communication in a democracy.
It is the task of the media representatives, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
According to Koivus, television is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech are met.
Is there more that we have already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one in the promise, it is necessary to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
The public takes the risk in this sense, if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be branded as a message for politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or in the general direction.
A clever bet from a sissy
In the upcoming speech of Sipilä, what the Prime Minister will not say is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this way it can bring out its own view without grunting noise.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because the more specific questions cannot be asked.
According to Kuutti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on the TV - the sweat, the shaking of the hands.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if the person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what President Barack Obama and his partners do on a regular basis.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be truly exceptional for the public.
It has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmail that is coming.
On Friday, wage-earners’ organisations will hold a demonstration and strike against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give a speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a statement from the Prime Minister, which would also allow for discussion.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, (sd.) announces that he will challenge Sipilä to the dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can’t hide forever,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a getaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
“The boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inner Finland also confirms the case to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed in young people’s violent fad: You’re going to get angry
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish-backed free fighter, posted a video on Facebook, appealing especially to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a major speech against the street fights of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of free games.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the wildness of young people.
Amirkha has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the ground, sitting on the other and hitting the other without thinking about any of these consequences when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are immigrants.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and Finns.
It's just that you're fighting on the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland,” says Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very serious.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a long time.
That’s a different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you can blame yourself for it.
Think twice before you go with one of these guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You get the kind of hate that I don't like.
You have some pretty bad things going on here, and you're not going to cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present to the government its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central).
The Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require SAK, the largest wage-earner organisation, to soften its previous position.
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly commented on the issue on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will consider the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that instead of coercive laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for a social agreement did not qualify for SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of a productivity leap of 5%.
Comment: Mass demonstration threatens to suffocate - "It feels a little funny to put on a fist"
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies from one employee camp to the next.
Is it to call on the government to overthrow it or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK’s ally leaders were blatantly blatantly angry at the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close.
The threat spread to the Akava people.
The teachers’ trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or daycare facility will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of STTK, Antti Palola (sd), made a conciliatory appearance.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he would make an alternative proposal for a productivity leap of 5%, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder (kok), immediately announced that his contract paper had already been completed.
At first, the SAK office didn’t even have a yard.
It is difficult for President Lauri Lylyn (sd) to agree when the leaders of the alliance just Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for a joint proposal of employees to emerge, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s Board of Directors.
Mr Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously worked as a special supporter for the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described that the government’s expertise in the field has improved all the time.
It was a coincidence or not, but Palola’s output took a bit of a break from the Finnish seismicists, whose front photo was AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a fitting paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: “This must not happen again”
Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Duma, said that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki July celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced into the European Union's sanctions regime, to attend the meeting - a matter which the President recalled to journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia was able to make it easy, so Naryshkin continued to taunt Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be obstructed.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who is the head of the meeting in Ula Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff mirror: "The paints in tight"
Today, Tappara and Lukko continue the bull days in Hakamets, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakametsä there will be no actual goal parties.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to win a 3-2 extension win from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from the loss of two goals.
Tuesday was a lot more win-win.
The Blues, who started off as a stagger, had round zero points, and loss rates were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setting on the club’s pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rumanians.
In the last two seasons, Tappara has just dropped out of the Lukko finals.
A decisive 7th match has been required for both odds.
In the last season, Lukko already broke the series in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three side and passed.
There are no major changes in group compositions except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will be on a whirlwind today.
With the goal of Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: A bad play going on in the Ace
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he played the lead.
The underdog sent the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed to camp sensationally.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ash story in Pori.
The unnamed and wood-carved batapak advanced to the surprise of everyone in the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Mattia and Pelto.
In the fall games, the players coloured their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver they won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the new work of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for ants has built a baton on the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been squatting off the ice like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are elsewhere in non-sparkling gaming.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, Pekka Rautakallio plays the lead role.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio as Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery's original work of 1976 in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There's nothing in the Iron Hall but Rocky's nickname.
Rautakallio’s philosophy of playing games does not include rushing and snitching.
He appreciates a hard game, but it’s different to play hard than a pig.
Last season, <0xC3><0x84>ssie Garret Stafford hit the head of JERE Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don’t accept such a game and it doesn’t belong in the ace hockey game, the hot-hot Rautakallio woke up after the game to the Satakunta People.
This season’s team is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, police, and thugs.
There are practically no key players at the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill deficit.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface, squat.
In 1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance of the ants in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan wouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapukki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would not have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, in the movie, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to former bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now for the first time Olga is acting under Tuuka’s direction.
Olga’s role in Apulanta’s “Make Us Beautiful” is played by Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka csamples and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model, Sirkka, the easier it is to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka that he trusted me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and texted.
Sirkka has helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a recession, and it was really rough.
There was a very small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you're up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film.
At the very least, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, over the past 10 years she has worked so hard with Tuuka that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
The couple living in Iit, however, often plans to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take the entire Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asked which streets and when to empty them.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive film in Finland.
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is one of the most expensive drama films in Finland, with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animated film is set to rise beyond Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will be filmed in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie to be.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
“I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” she says.
The film was originally planned to have a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big star.
However, 100 million people could be involved in the film, because every aspect and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no slack at all.
Iron Sky Universe, the film’s production company, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsters' fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Some time ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The promotion of a hoodie or a t-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a prank.
But times change.
Sporting has become a real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike that have risen to the wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the border between funny and trendy is fading: if something is already quite jutty, it begins to turn into irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the standard fashion, in which the trend setters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothing as a way to separate from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet is put on top, with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' recognizable tracksuits, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, Versace’s autumn blouses make it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to display logos in your clothing?
Russian politician published proof: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagili, where Russia Arms Expo, which showcases Russian war industry products, was held in 2015.
In recent days, Russian media have reported that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove the large Zotovia tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages in which he appears to be peeking at the hatch of the armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least not based on those pictures, it’s not about getting stuck or angry at anything.
It's full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into the battle tank, it was the BMP-3 assault tank.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komomolskaya Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck and didn’t really spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained his admiration for Russia’s new technology in the exhibition because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the writer a fool.
One fool wrote, and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
“I’m tall and rotting, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn’t happen,” he told Russkaja sluzhba novostei.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged rapture have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with the Bloknot.ru story, where Zotov was told he was hung out of the tank hatch trying to get out and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his pint.
The Bloknot website later published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition shared their views on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

The Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Candlestick of Lassen from 1962 looks like it was designed today.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool to the stream.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
In the pool there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either to be reused as process water or to be flown to the environment according to the permit through the surface watering field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the dam structures in the basin.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Danske Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, structural reforms are in agreement, but there are also minor differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a lot of message for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Taloussomomi.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF is forecasting a 0.4 percent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 percent next year.
Today, in its new economic forecast, Danske expects growth to fall to zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have found the basis for the latest observations.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total production had been growing slightly in the summer,” says Kuoppamäki.
Reduced confidence in industry or other so-called softer metrics have again been given less attention.
However, the differences are only a few per cent of the decimals.
Nintendo has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will begin her work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for tracking Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to involve Nintendo in mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more unaccompanied asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing each year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others, have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, that hundreds of minors are lost in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
In 2013, 156 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors were made in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear at the hearing that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he or she may have been found to have reached the age of majority there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were granted for the reason that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors.
There are not yet total statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of minor asylum seekers is therefore known and has grown clearly, which will probably also affect the number of missing persons.
What about those who have received a decision to convert?
Will they also disappear into the “dark labour market”?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the decisions to convert, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants in the country.
He has taken action on this.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU’s Internal Affairs Council, spoke about practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studios online - see photos of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife, Nina Mikkonen, sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in the industry.
The first report was published by the web magazine Iltamacasini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer filmed for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that you will find interested ones.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these will also be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current Myrskylän home.
We can't take all the goods with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what items are being disposed of.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use of television and radio equipment.
After a history of strokes, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
The cuts in night and shifts are a big stir for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the slips raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area is almost completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no long-distance or short-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left on the wagon.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday morning from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by superior forces, according to HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL can’t tell you exactly which bus routes will take place on Friday.
Workers’ organisations organise a mass demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11am to 13pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees have attempted to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - teacher thought a self-made clock was a bomb
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought his own clock was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce his electronics hobby to the production.
One of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in and the situation ended with the boy being taken handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no time has Muhammad ever claimed anything but that he had made a clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of committing a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, police said the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display, between which there were wires.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case, and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering if the case is yet another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
British leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms made by the right-wing press have also been shared by members of Corbyn’s own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration honoured the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of Labour.
In particular, there are those among the MPs who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear for the first time today as a party leader in Parliament during the prime minister’s Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family death is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family death in Greenwood, Minnesota, for a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house dead in the Short family.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-year-old and successful company
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bleeding is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short said there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I have received 50 bids from the company over the past ten years.
I have rejected all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, Short’s family bought a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as the dream of a car collector in Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offers various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no comments on Short’s website that defamed pre-emptive courses, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos Month Horse Owner Award in the treatment event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on his honorary plaque.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it happened.
According to Loiri, the coach of the successful horse, Korpi, gets full peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka determines and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
An astonishingly stunning gesture from the NHL star - "The Greatest Athlete's Donation of All Time"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (about 6.7 million) to the Children’s Hospital in Montreal.
According to the hospital, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital raise funds for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban and Canadiens signed a deal worth eight years and 72 million dollars.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual contribution.
Subban will receive a room in the hospital that bears its name for its donation.
Canadiens players have previously been instrumental in helping local hospitals.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars to the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money to another city’s major hospital to provide the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife for the evening from a Japanese café, serving only bikinis and aprons
The theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a chicken café, a vampire café, a fish café and now a wife café.
It hits lonely, crowded, and hungry.
It was reported by Metro.
The Ore no Yome (my wife) café in Tokyo can be ordered for the evening of a wife or husband.
This is a waitress who pretends to be the client’s spouse.
"Police" is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
She's just wearing a apron and a bikini, and her husband is wearing tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the candidates, from the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
More than 150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: attacks on car security will begin to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to Intel’s release.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of the best cyber security practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the results of ASRB’s research.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting company, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can consolidate best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford’s Focus RS has been waiting for years to come.
The car is finally starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the car world is watching at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
With its 2.3-litre 350-horsepower engine, Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for Finns, initially it is estimated to be 52,000 euros.
The car can now be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in its announcement.
Favorite brand Kia introduced two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
Among Finns, the new fourth generation Sportage will be more important than the two new ones, with which Kia intends to capture a larger segment of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage created by Gregory Guillaume, the new European design director, is more round than ever before.
The wheelbase and the outside dimensions have become a centimetre there, and the car splits the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo powered by 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of the year, the new Kia Optimats arrived in our country.
Suddenly, looking at the new one, it doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optims with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are available at the beginning.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
At the same time, the sale of the Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu returns to the stage in bold overalls
The singer Chisu is part of the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue briefs have a striking, open neck.
The outfit beautifully presents the shard waist of the singer-star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year hiatus, the singer, who became a mother, has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Back to the stage and standing in front of the public after a long break, I'm not really nervous.
“I’ve missed everything about music,” the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release a new and fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to create new songs.
“At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album,” Chisu says.
Kim Kardashian’s motherhood style is startling again – now the breast is visible
Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast care in casually sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America, when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the show with her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breast.
It reveals the skin-coloured bra under the dress when the lightning flashes.
Last time Kardashian was dressed in an amazonic maternity suit, he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The accessories were highlighted by black over-the-ear boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation was about to be performed.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model, Manon Leloup, wanted to make it clear that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine collected Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you’ve been posing in the outfits of top designers in the previous season, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry, competing for work with the co-workers.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go on for years with a hotel room or an apartment where the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most wanted jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not just one kind of weight.
Agent New York might ask you to drop pounds, but Paris will say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In the design sections, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is bleak.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are slicked by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a display of clothes.
They want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York City is currently hosting fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year’s collection.
Roope Salminen, who changed her style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays the band’s founding member Antti Lautala in Apulanta’s early years film.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I’m a rap artist who is about to turn 26, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before the shoots, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of those people, so I think it’s good that I’m just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
A man who runs the Roope Salminen and the Dogs band is not going to play the role.
The punk manners come naturally to the man.
In the punk episode of the Stars, I'm sure many people saw a taste for it, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
The main actors of the 1993-2004 film "Make Us Beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played the bass in Apulanta, were announced today.
The band’s core group, which has become known to the public, is presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta, bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his upcoming wash as early as last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted a photo of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the bees and chinbears, has shaved her face into a siloposcian, and dyed her brown hair to black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the matter, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group, advises.
Younger children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they are seeing, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard about the news about refugees on television, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
The child should not be intimidated in vain, even if he is harassed and frightened.
A small child follows closely the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if they think about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how we feel about this in our family.
Is the world, after all, a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different upbringing perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety whenever possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This may be of benefit to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermon-Illustrating Pallosalama difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was fine-tuned to the blow in the middle of summer.
It only garnered victories and doubles until the collapse of the Tampere raves at the end of July.
Because the slave was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered time to the shelter from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had pharyngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two patients to get rid of it.
As Apilan Pallosalama had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says she is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was the second SE dam in Turku in record time after Taruntuule.
Apilan Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a small bend at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a difference for the ori.
The horse certainly moved forward, and I hope it would have been evened out.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you haven’t had fun with it, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori have, on the other hand, lost such a lightning bolt that the opponents have been amazed.
At mid-speed, the competitors will not be able to reach Pallosalama, from which even warm-blooded squats will be released.
In the wishes of the North, Vermo has a nest run.
However, there is a difference in how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It’s pretty difficult at the time of departure and might even be ticking under the boom of the car and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave is calmer now than when Turku leaves.
Apilan Pallosalama is able to come from the bow when he is in good shape, and we are going to drive with it to win, the coach promises.
That’s why you can’t get rid of unnecessary iPhone apps.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may sometimes be removed in the future — but not all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, said Tim Cook, CEO of Buzzfeed.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Magazine kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which became a forced update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook didn’t mention which Apple iPhone apps worked closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company doesn’t want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
In this way, Eurostat revised its forecast of 0.2 % a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than a year ago.
Across the EU-28, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most from the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was 1.9 per cent at the lowest prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% rise in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
U.S. Fed tries to tighten monetary policy next
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest rate in less than a year, but more surely within three years of the Fed’s return to raising interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the recession will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession may hit its fastest by next autumn, and the pace of the financial markets before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets act the way they used to — and if they react to Fed’s extortion of money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by German market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker at Deutsche Bank in London in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle research.
The Bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international customers last week.
The strategists who drafted the study and the report do not believe they know when exactly the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key economic and financial market variables are now on the same or another model as at the time of the previous interest rate increases - and what the consequences might be.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than they once were in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, maybe not a year.
The Fed’s monetary policy and the leaders who decide on how to tune it up have hinted that the time is getting ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for more than nine years can be achieved already this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0,25 percentage points, which lasted exactly two years, ended with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The financial market began with the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States in 2007, and a year later, the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare on Judgment Day.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy shocks started slower than the previous Fed rate increases have typically been.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and tougher than ever since the 1930s recession.
Deutsche strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the reversals of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed’s interest rates and their economic and financial impact have been reported since the 1950s.
With the onset of the recession, the earliest period since the first raising of interest rates has been less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one to two years of the start of Fed’s interest rate increases.
In turn, the Fed has raised and lowered its steering rate since the early 1950s by a dozen different cycles.
Each time there has been some deviations from others, and the multiplier is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely to be possible to draw any definite conclusions on the impact of the subsequent interest rate increases.
The strategy reminds us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the perpetrators, may not be undisputedly identified, even through decades of research.
But three facts about the causes that led to the crisis and the causes that have increased its destructive power are likely to be somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They replaced the traces of the techno dome, and at the same time grew the following.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and already too high, increased even more as a result of the monetary policy impact of the central bank overshoot.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history so far.
3) In particular, the crazily cheap debt financing, which was almost unencumbered in the financial sector, has sprung up the largest exchange bubbles in most financial market segments from shares in real estate, debt securities and commodities to the previous financial history.
It is also unlikely to give rise to a very serious dispute that the financial markets, which had risen to heights on the basis of increasingly complex debt levers, were in an extraordinarily dangerous and unstable mess when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
Financial structures on debt relief, or valuation bubbles, did not last until the time after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nuclear fusion, for example, by mentioning the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered the stance of their monetary policy to be even lighter even longer than it was before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has long been not as cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is much heavier than it was before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) Liquidity issued by central banks, which is more volatile and cheaper than before, has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed down the key types of securities and assets to their most expensive, whether at the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do strategists latziness with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession in the way it has ever been.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money supply.
Perhaps the future image of the French bank, Albert Edwards, is not as strange as it might seem.
For quite some time now, he has trained the Bank’s international investor clients for Fed’s following full translations:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out - and soon it is time for Fed to rush to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE strikes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufactures computers and printers to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate service provider, the company says.
In November, HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focused on business sales, and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October of last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-recurring costs of $2.7 billion (approximately $2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to shift its operations to low-cost countries, with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
Last year, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, clicking "General" and then clicking "Software Update".
If the update is complete, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation when the "Software update failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush to pass or try to upgrade via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the update size and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests uninstallable apps and then reinstalling them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out of service, it can lead to a violation of the update.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations were accompanied by so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out and it's enough that I've filed a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the Board of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger, in the Board of Kährs and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the ownership of Kährs runs through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner.
This is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of directors of the Karelia Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the capital interests of a Finnish family-owned company.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and this starting point was safeguarded in this context,” Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the capital fund Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg ready for ownership.
The reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre for adult asylum seekers is opened.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents today starting at 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the former Rescue College property.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the provision of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy have agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for tightening the working life of the government.
The organisation also wishes to include other central wage and salary organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the focus is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative measures to reduce the price of work will then be taken back.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters at the meeting of the organization’s administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no capacity for discussion.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party is very excited to have a conversation if there's a one-way relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the Board of Directors, and it has always been constructive to him.
According to Palola, the operation of Sunday dinners in the field of STTK, especially on Sundays, is a painful place.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the coercive legislation by which it would be implementing some of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, STTK does not warm up the possibility of preparing an alternative package with the present SDP.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government’s work-life blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, e.g., the salary of the first sick days is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
STTK stresses that central organisations have called employees to protest, and the aim has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder
The Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, commends STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming to the same line with Akava, as Akava has already outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come forward to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it had long been preparing its own proposal, with which it would be ready to negotiate a five percent competitive jump aimed at the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will go to the government and employers in the country,” Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcos" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
The Green Left of the University of Tampere’s Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels on Wednesday evening at 21:05.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train processors with a televised speech.
Single-call, monarchical talk
Sipilä’s speech has sparked criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that “Sipilä could give a speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement from the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed”.
According to Greens Ville Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, "the only call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja said on Facebook that “monarchist meinkin: the Prime Minister will tell the people what’s best for them.”
SDP President Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Just six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented by SAK’s Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK’s President and CEO Jyri Häkämies.
He has been criticized for making the speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service mission to promote the comprehensive publicity of the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications in Yle news.
Like we were in the Tammela era.
The speech has also sparked mockery.
When the evening comes, dinner is served in good time, the children are combed and dressed for their best.
My mom wears a nicer skull and my dad ties a tie to his neck.
At 9 a.m., the TV will be quieted like before, during the time of the Tammelas,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell us in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who are hiding their capital in tax havens, who draw up pardon laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut down when the state has run out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has posted a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, common coal, debt and team spirit in the evening?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia’s offer to allow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would, after some time, have left power elegantly.
However, the West did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition could not be disarmed, the opposition and al-Assad had to have a speech link immediately, and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he told me to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalled in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment
Ahtisaari reports that he communicated a message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are not two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said al-Assad’s forces had already committed several massacres at that time, and key opposition groups refused all the agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is sceptical about Ahtisaari’s speech, because in his experience Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that the Churkin spoke with the Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about the speeches by Mr Thurkin, I would have replied that I would like to hear from the same President, Vladimir Putin, so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin’s fault to hold power with a supporter of al-Assad.
The refugee flow is our own act
During the talks on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own act.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused,” Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum-seekers’ organisation centre with artillery in Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty building in the city centre of Tornio.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppinen, vice-president of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not assembled and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43.
Thirteen delegates opposed the convention center.
On that basis, one could expect the decision to be positive, Mr Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and a quick response was received.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint venture at a time.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), the half-life of holiday money in the public sphere would only cover part of the calculation of the price of work sought by the Government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations can agree on such a package.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for substitutes for the work-life blackmail announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, half of the holiday money would work as a means because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday meal cut.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in the amount of holiday money because they are enshrined in collective agreements rather than in the law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a statement from the Government.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislation then starts to move, i.e. the train is on the move and it gets more and more difficult.
It's a good time.
“It won’t be long in such matters, if there is a will,” Sipilä said.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the opiate and the helatorista into unpaid days off without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the salary of the first sick days is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are implemented as a coercive legislation by trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
Workers’ centre organisations are organising a mass demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves expansion of juice hall warehouse
The Board of Directors of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall, or juice hall.
The reason for this criticism was that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally mentioned.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
While the agenda was still talking about an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väist<0xC3><0xB6> (ps.) explains.
Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The city government eased its previous steep stance to bring street name signs in Karelia to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of upholding the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it, and Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savonlinna dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no Karelian street signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of Karelian language should also be viewed in a broad-minded manner now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of these can be used well for a wide range of marketing in the province.
The abolition of train connections reduces the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it affects whether you can live and work here at all,” says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been a follow-up to the report on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that we do not succeed in reducing our chances by the measures of state power, as is now the case.
We should look at the impact of these terminations on employment, for example,” Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka M<0xC3><0xB6>nkk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that it is already difficult to market the university to Western Finland at the moment, because the traffic connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
There was a loud noise in Joensuu for the Siun war.
The Joensuu City Government’s view of the regional Siun sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is there.
Pentti Kessalo, a member of the City Board (in the picture) presented the resignation of the entire project at the Government meeting on Monday, but his presentation was cancelled.
The Board approved the proposal for the decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train journey from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift will be missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to government savings.
The purchase of train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will set new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped from the place
The Rescue Department released a 12-year-old who climbed to the roof and couldn’t get down from the roof on her own.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six o’clock on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no ladders to take you to the roof.
It did not stop the mob of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got the same route down, but one didn't.
As a result, other people slipped away and the passers-by alerted the rescue service to help the last person safely back to the ground.
FedEx’s operating profit is twofold, decreasing the outlook for the fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its entire year’s profit forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects a result of $10.40 to $10.90 next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite the higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said it expects its operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is on the rise.
Fred Smith, President and CEO, said the company “will perform steadily, taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and global trade.”
Plans for salaries for the duration of the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that it was going to hire between 90 and 95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx’s profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Earnings per share came to $2.42, which is what is left of the $2.44 average forecast. Twelve analyst polls were conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s net sales.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The revenue of the Express unit was higher due to higher basic fees, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, approximately an hour before the opening bell, FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $10.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent of the bill for this year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
This week, the governors of the US Central Bank will sit around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the steering rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the financial interests of the nation must be put ahead of everything else by the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues.
The Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: they must maximise U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision whether the U.S. economy is prepared to be weaned from a record-breaking incentive that has been brought about by the short-term interest rate almost zero since the end of 2008 .
While most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the central bank officials already on guard more concerned about increasing instability, and fearing what would happen if the federal fund rate were raised by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to follow," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for maintaining interest rates, increased uncertainty in the world market is a valid enough reason to wait,” he says.
No agreement has been reached on the Central Bank's decision, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as according to the key indicator, the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the decline in securities markets if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the attack by promising that the next draw will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they must make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic.”
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
While job creation slowed down in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1 per cent, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of recovery.
While inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, central bank policymakers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the significantly reduced oil price.
The economy "is clear of even higher interest rates and also needs them, given the tightness of the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world shook last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fell by as much as 16% from its May record, as investors feared China would slow down global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation, which indicates that interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and recent weeks’ news of the weakness of China’s economy, policy makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Special Investigator and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the suggestion of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could "decreas" the increase in the amount of money, caused a revolution in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in the interest rate, and Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, refers to the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings “despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, such as the collapse of the market in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil does not come close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Rio Grande, Brazil’s pediatrician, promotes a healthy diet for mammals
The Brazilian pediatrician SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in audiences, despite Nine Channel’s efforts to bring news to the Leader Show Today Show
Karl Stefanovic’s and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to report on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader demonstration failed to increase Today’s attendance.
Nine's morning program was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull suppressed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance didn’t seem to hurt Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average attendance was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared with 339,000 in Today.
Today's average increased slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The big news of the Seven Channel was the 800-word series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing premiere.
A new drama series that collected a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson would be the driving force behind the popular series alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave this a real certainty.
The X Factor program on Seven was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a double destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O’Keefe’s new quiz program gathered a total of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) went up to 623,000 viewers – a small enough win from Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewers averaged 520,000 viewers, and on the second half-hour, the number was staggering 720,000.
The average for Hot Set was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night watch average decline gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the attendance of the McGuire program.

The finalist agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up with at The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls don’t really know who got the last rose.
However, while talking with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?” their answers could offer a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been smooth since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of Sarah and Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is truly earthy, it’s fun to be with him,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visit meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game — I’m with him with all my heart now,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten-channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open training day since the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the swap bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league turnout dropped the ball on its first flight kick when the team returned to Minnesota on Tuesday with a 20-3 count.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Haynen to return the next flight kick and took her into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomer a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Drops Flight Shot by Minnesota Vikings in First Quarter
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and her numerous Australian fans had hoped for on a man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen on a trip from the field after the crash, and later told Australian radio partner Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared her to her 2007 Origin debut, when the feed in her own goal area led to the Queensland goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted a photo on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed in police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in a crowd that protested against the country’s new draft constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region’s top official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group is demanding a state of its own.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, of which 11 have been police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted on the clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and the authorities have said that the new charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center says there is a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
A second, narrow, low-pressure front, located halfway between Cape Verde’s archipelago and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami weather forecast centre added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees in Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making the announcement, the director wrote about his personal experience by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are made by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it is equivalent to the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugerielief up to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War is mainly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help people with mildly obese diabetes
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for people with mildly obese type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these slightly obese diabetics live longer after a weight loss operation than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote the editorial for a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
In bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal cavity.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the subjects in the study have been morbidly obese and have had a BMI of 35 or more.
BMI, or weight-to-length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person is over 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, with medicinal treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut subjects decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained roughly the same in 29 people treated by means other than surgery.
Thirty-six per cent of the cut-off people had a complete and 28 per cent partial improvement in their diabetes.
For comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the “bad” LDL-cholesterol “were generally better in the surgery group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients’ blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the A1c level of hemoglobin dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This improved “glycemic control” as described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, however, did not reduce mortality over the course of five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had increased weight loss (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission by 16.7 per cent and 16.9 per cent (46 per cent, respectively).
The University of Arizona’s College of Medicine-Phoenix’s Blackstone says that while research doesn’t show survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had undergone weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying in a 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial in that they show that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group,” he says, without the risk of an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient has BMI between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ll wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the number of deaths in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US’s violent response caused a chain of violent events.
“After 9/11, in a letter I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the ingestion of hand sanitizer in children has increased fourfold.
Poisoning centres across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in the intake of heavily alcohol-containing hand sanitizers in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgia Poisoning Center.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poisoning Data Centre, the cases of ingestion of disinfectants reported to the Poisoning Data Centres in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink the disinfectant intentionally, while others want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectants to get a cheap rise.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with an alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
A pleasant smell of disinfectant can attract younger children.
“The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those with added smell.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavored disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand sanitizer can contain anything from 45% to 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Stephen Thornton, director of the hospital care at the University of Kansas Center for Poisoning, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t leave a whisky shot lying on the table, but leave the hand sanitizer visible, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry scent hand sanitizers at school and was taken to emergency care.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult drunk driving, says First Aid Clinician Chris Ritchey, who cared for a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain injuries, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
This could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in the north of New York State planned to poison their “evil” teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police must prevent the plan as a "difficult nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths shy away from Celtic controversy, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn around
Hearts fight the Scottish Football Association for charges against Neilson, and Warburton is on guard for January recruitments that can disrupt team unity
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney’s first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pottodri Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths detracts from conflict.
Rumors have emerged about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately overtook them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bored the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for a championship with Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador de Boer said: “In the Netherlands, the highlights of Celtic games are no longer displayed, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also non-Scottish want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and the resulting downfall from the Champions League was quickly followed by the loss to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series with ten men, with a five-point difference to the next.
Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
We just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters, because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it is important to stay together.
Warburton is on guard for January player transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton was just a few weeks ago commenting on possible targets for January’s player transfers, he’s on guard for recruitment, asserting that he doesn’t want to confuse the gang with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment time is before the whole time, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can cause more trouble.
Celtic interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is associated with Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and has not been able to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Association for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after that. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card judged by Collum in the last eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson remains behind his message, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was punished for admitting to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburg, before Edinburg derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a moment's impulse," the attacker said, adding, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I move on to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United government still has faith in the ability of the management team to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes is delighted with the "dirty win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Acces, but managed to reach their seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s a trophy or a league that hasn’t won games like this.”
Scotland’s unemployment remains the same as the UK’s total
Employment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment rose to 1.82 million in the UK as a whole.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK’s 5.5 per cent, according to the National Statistics Centre (ONS) figures.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, and the number of employed persons now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I witnessing execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm sitting in the audience gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I’m starting to feel terrible today as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and because there are often more applications than free places, participants are selected through a terrible drawdown.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats allocated to the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever chooses, watch the event cool.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through phone calls over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I've seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoman journalist on Twitter accused me of failing to be neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get involved.
I complained to the reporter.
The vote admitted that "would have been able to put his word better", but still feels that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I've made.
I'm not going to go through all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I am sure there was not enough evidence justifying the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And this is the perspective I see him dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists there who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police chase.
Officer Canning Vale remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters away from a policeman who was trying to “hate him gently back to the beach.”
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, he tried to distract them by directing them to the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police negotiation."
“Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape,” said senior officer Castledine.
Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Officials Attempted to Spy on him and Threatens to Stop Competing
Peter Moody has argued that Racing Victoria’s agents tried to infiltrate his stables last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officials and the Division of the Nobleness of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatain due to a treatment operation on the day of the race was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that her goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that she has been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check on the spy allegations for a year and a half, and he did not want "it to look like envy."
"I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything breaks out at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I go home today and sleep well.
I want to get my head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man — I name him when asked — and offered him a job in my stables if he conveyed information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, it's a good idea for them to fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Is Victoria Racing finally determined to become a man, and perhaps to pass on responsibility not only to the coaches but also to what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now might make them think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has grown with a long-standing study of Lidar’s cobalt, and the late rejection led him to conclude that he could “put his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for training the invincible champion Black Cavier, has called the rule of taking care of the race day "smiling" after the mud or clay shark has been put on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
“I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could've had a hatch last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race for hatching, from which the trustees began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver responsible for traffic jams in Cobra
Police have arrested a man who was in a traffic jam after hitting a cyclist in Cobra this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team’s struggles would be part of the “line”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm's "painting" on their side when it unexpectedly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely hiding his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a "show window" for the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggles and said they were just focusing on "contact" struggles.
Bellamy added that his confidence was enhanced by criticism of Storm by two leading coaches, which means that they are afraid of losing to the team.
“This always comes up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not exchanged anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have only stressed contact in our struggles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and this was a small shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of an “exciting rugby” by reminding his mentor that Bennett’s coach St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing “unfortunately”.
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He felt it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play a game like that when you have players like that.
He brought out that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style as a rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'll be more confident when they say things like that because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it an exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting breach of the defensive line and a failure to score a goal?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Stormi is free this weekend because they have already won a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-finals at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 guarantees to the Serbian man on drug charges
A man who is threatened with a life-long possession of 40 cocaine kilograms smuggled into Queensland has been released for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht, who came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic is threatened with a possible life-long possession of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire quantity, and that he might have been in a coffee shop for completely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
“He has close ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 guarantee to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it was not alone enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he would hand over his passports to both Australia and Serbia, report to the police on a daily basis and stick to his ban on outdoor activities between 6 and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous unscrupulous pictures of the children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, looked at the computers on the scene, and found “worrying” web searches using search terms used to search for unscrupulous images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he "showed himself to be a cop to scare them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to the scare of people.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures and when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for bait.
He said that after drinking, he is sick and wants to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shook and cried.
My mother saw unscrupulous pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, acknowledged his guilt for making or taking pictures of unscrupulous children on June 14 last year. He broke his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to allow social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before the trial.
He was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to parliament
Africa’s oldest leader Mugabe fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by the opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them of bouncing on Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they were buoying and interrupting him in the middle of his speech to Parliament on the state of the country, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party group discipline overseer Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their cell phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
“The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message is titled ‘death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group discipline overseer said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “worrying” of threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will be split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster-growing enterprise hardware and services.
Expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual revenue will be over $50 billion, and it will “focus on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
The division disbands a company founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that he is going to be rehabilitated as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire misses at least four of the following English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity for this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, there is always a risk of additional injuries as the player tries to return through the middle.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, in the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal’s wider overall performance since 2007-08, in six out of eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvements to the injury statistics for the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, there may be a vulnerable period in which you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stabilized, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to spin his team when Arsenal starts their Champions League match on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspuri next Wednesday.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to maintain balance and give a break to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F-block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from last season's Champions League surrender to Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CAML) announced the 2015 Men’s Year to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person’s chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were “in a healthy mind.”
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved in the likelihood of possible mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this social media through communication time, style passes the content and the immediateness of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - personal growth and friendship of inner longing - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t get any greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
With Joey and Chandler’s numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross miss Rachel – the humor of these came from the knowledge that, yes, men can identify with all of this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As a volunteer at Samaritans explained to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understand how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make me feel better.”
Often men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you attend FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, and all the shooting sites have been redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, what’s even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, attend #FriendsFest
Di Maria sets goals and helps PSG slap on Malm<0xC3><0xB6> side
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> with Blaise Matuid and Edison Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal in the Champions League in less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French Champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their lead as Cavan struck the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same block A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a sequel, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG scored, it wasn’t a classic game, as Laurent Blanc’s team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and was later changed from the field. Malm<0xC3><0xB6> is the team of his old hometown and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will create problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and it’s a good start, even though there are things we’re going to have to hone this season,” Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I'm sorry we couldn't make one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes that were made after the 2–2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he remained in the shadow of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian striker was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran into Marco Verratt's supply behind Malm<0xC3><0xB6>'s defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish across Johan Wiland's net in the back corner.
However, if someone expected an easy and big profit from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> was a stagnant opponent. It won Celtic in a settlement match when it reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in a deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which passed the button at Kevin Trapp's goal post.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble because of lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five companies in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic’s touch right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-working with his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic’s feeding that Di Maria sent a twister that tilted around Wiland’s goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play, thanks to the Uruguayan Cavani, who scored his sixth goal in the season, after Ibrahimovic had snapped forward from the left of Maxwell's cross-feed.
It ended Malm<0xC3><0xB6>'s hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the replacement Ezequiel Lavez's goal was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll put a hat on Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion by selling shares
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, who suffered from a price collapse in commodities, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is putting pressure on demand and causing destruction in all markets.
The new subscription raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares rose by 2.77% in the FTSE 100 index of <0xC2><0xA3>131.60, which opened at 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed last week that as part of a $2.5 billion share deal, Glencore had a broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital of 125 pence, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices for coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and will respond to President Barack Obama’s last visit to Beijing in November, the statement said.
The President of the United States and his wife Michelle Obama will arrange a dinner for X and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi will allow us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of issues of common interest worldwide, regional and bilateral, and at the same time it will allow President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues of disagreement,” the statement added.
During a visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with a number of U.S. technology leaders before continuing toward New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concern about China’s alleged online espionage and the increased irresponsibility of the country in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon has made a difference in filmmaking.
Matt Damon teamed up with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown to discuss the difference Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
HBO’s Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight interrupted Brown’s efforts to highlight the need for different perspectives on the dark protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
“When we talk about diversity, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon said.
Shocked Brown reacted in disbelief, commenting on "Oh, Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
The other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, no matter what the director is, how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only dark character is the whore that his white pimp beats.
The producer of The Dear White People called for the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon bluntly replied that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the movie play by writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only dark-skinned person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WHITE that hurts."
After its release, Twiittaus collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments coincide with a time when the exact racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the release as the Grammy Award winner of the Album of the Year.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black experiences, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter chiefs recently released a statement to answer Fox News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive a prize of $1 million.
The competition programme, which has just ended its seventh period, has never had a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge on time, making him the first athlete to solve American Ninja Warrior’s exhausting 4th episode, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock at winning the $1 million main prize.
“So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never made or lived more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big salary increase.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter about the finalist and why Britten doesn’t get more reward money, even though he’s the first competitor of all time who’s managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money will be given to the one who has the fastest time,” Weed said.
While money is a great reward and a life changer, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he's upset.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for the eighth season, the filming of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season has not been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played their role perfectly on Tuesday when they won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to rise to the half-way end of Houston Astros in a race from another place in the American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how they are made,” said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early support for the attack when Detroit ran three times in the first two pairs, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in a pair of turns and saved three runs.
This was only his third quality piece in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to enter every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers surrogate Victor Martinez hit three times and made it possible for him to run two races, which were his first beats after mid-August.
This was Martinez’s first three-stakes night after hitting Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He was waving well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three races behind in the second half of the seventh pair, and it was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started a pair of shifts by hitting the left field line twice.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks came home with the click of a nest, and Simon was burned directly by another nest player, Brian Dozier, before Simon was replaced with left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player standing against him, the front-runner Miguel Sano, who pulled the two-legged run to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner on the second base, VerHagen was given a third base by Trevor Plouffe to hit the double-game grounding.
It was a record for the main series: the 27th time this season, when Plouffe hit the double game.
After Detroit had secured the race at the start of the ninth race, Mauer raced two beaten races against Tigers' closing Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three feeds in his fifth rescue.
Detroit initially took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers scored three runs in the first two pairs against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured players before the game after being out of the lower back for more than a month due to inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a few nice feeds on the third pair of turns."
After Hughes caught the starter in the first nest, he let the second nest player Ian Kinsler move in one step.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the pitch, who took himself to the first base in midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos, a triple player, continued by hitting the right and causing the second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned in his attempt to advance to the third base.
The Tigers continued with another pair of turns and received one fire, two in the case of a nest, a running snatcher from James McCann, and two in the case of a nest, a running centimeter from Anthony Goselt, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said Paul Molitor, team leader at Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the feed readings and entered a running third pair, after which he was replaced by the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs for six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez got away due to a stretch on his shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder squat, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four launches after left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of the right chin in the abdominal muscles.
The Tigers and Twins series of three games will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) sets himself against the right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) in Minnesota.
Xi calls for a wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to steer the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the reform.
“Supporting transparency while driving reforms forward is a new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth,” Xi said.
The Steering Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting market access, a relaxation of border inspection principles, a call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created to identify the sectors and companies that cannot be invested in.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the statement says.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business operations.
The opinion also said that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are opening up to private financiers in order to open state-run sectors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits of foreigners, "green cards", is facilitated by optimising requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
