The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio in early 2017.
The association was approved unanimously by the Kuopio City Council on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal association, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will take place in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India’s new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, meets his Japanese colleague Shinzo Aben in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, with his first major foreign visit after the May election victory.
Modi’s five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian forces further away from their current positions where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were firing civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmijajaamo.
I was surprised that the group came from the very beginning.
There were visitors for two days as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Again next year.
“We’re still going to be hip-hop fans, so there’s no popping,” Kangas says.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday, which restricts the purchase of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply for permission from the Police Board to purchase or retain substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing these substances, if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not usually exceed limit values.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration, for example.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes by Nairn and Pitlochry
The defendant is awaiting trial for rapes in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a court hearing in Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry’s Scotland’s hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman “being unconscious, sleeping, and unable to make a decision for himself.”
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Upper Finland, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the judgment of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November at the Court of First Instance.
Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario left in the shade - Premier League - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, reinforced by Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest to Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
The Balotelli was still far from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already favorited the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona as Luis Suarez's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star in the team, instead of Balotelli, Raheem Sterling sparkled the tip of the middle field diamond, who scored a 3-0 win over the important opening goal of Hugo Llores.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than the Balotelli, is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common to a player who climbs the grass at its best at a speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves a big thank you for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman reported that Liverpool had systematically developed a more comprehensive player than the Northwest Londoner at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he says.
Governments of wage and salary organisations gather in pension negotiations - Finland - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus is being sought for pension negotiations today from the meetings of the labour market organisations themselves.
In the morning, the governments of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the state of the negotiations.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Labour market organisations have, among other things, engaged in a dispute over the commitment of the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be born during this week.
Barkwood.
Women's volleyball team from Rovaniemi, Woman Volley, stumbled on Vampula Athletes in the final of the training tournament in Pihtiputa on Sunday.
Vampula turned five to win a three-to-two-long match.
WoVo lost 15-11 in the final round.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyr<0xC3><0xB6>.
WoVo's six was a mess, in that the 190-cent American centimeter Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
It was played by Sara Niemi.
Despite his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyll<0xC3><0xB6>nen was able to play and together with Johanna Pekkarinen formed WoVo’s most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskmäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian passer-by and liberetto Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo went around as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend as Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shop" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday we will meet again at the sports school.
Lidl forging wild numbers in Finland

The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is expected to continue.
Lidl also said that it paid taxes to Finland amounting to nearly EUR 14 million over the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more likely to die due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment in sparsely populated areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video to honor their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
The researchers reviewed patient data from more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women, more than five years after the diagnosis.
Principal investigator Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
RELATED: New Medicines May Slow Down Pulmonary and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers reviewed women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and with cancer spreading more widely at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
“Scientists in oncology are best at treating this disease, and their reception is mostly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
Although remote care is becoming more common and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients who are away from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, women with ovarian cancer have a poor long-term survival rate regardless of their geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neavella, a 33-year-old mother living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Ostrobothnia.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the plan for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be made publicly available at the service point Osviitta.
Opinions are requested from the Environmental Board and the Ely Centre in Lapland.
The city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobiling activities related to tourism in the region.
The plan is to create a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
According to the proposal, no more than 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
You can also place refuelling points in a certain part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is valid for spring 2018.
The parking lot and the change in the pattern have also raised loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring blocks of flats have been hungry for both vote and worry about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no observations exceeding the guide values have been found in the studies.
The renewed fleet is lower than the old one.
The friendship park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers would have to transport the safaris to the departure points by buses, which would be an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also large enough for the skiers, better than the places presented as replacement places of departure, for example, the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges and the boat docking station.
The friendship park is also good for its location, because in the future the activities can expand into the area of Ounaspaviljonki, for example.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s sub-universal plan, which has not yet received legal force.
Decline of owner-occupied dwellings displayed in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in a group under 35, could lead to a decline in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today’s young consumers reach the “main target group” of garden sales for their age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the British Horticultural Trades Association (HTA).
According to a report by the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55% of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be worth about <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where horticultural products spend the least amount of money per household across the country.
According to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), however, an increase in rental of dwellings or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s leading gardening advisor, says that “for example, plants grown in removable growing containers are particularly popular with homeowners, because such growing containers can be included in their changes if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of flourishing in the horticultural sector, as ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid 90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, after last year’s March and April weather had been worse.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat for spying report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on spying by Americans and British forces in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy’s attorney general and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
Der Spiegel and The Intercept, a German newspaper, have written that documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spy destination for U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on spying on Ankara by the German Central Intelligence Service caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has performed in several successful films, has been attached to the female lead in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights in the morning, the filming of which starts this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg’s Munich film and Julian Schnabel’s Butterfly Glass.
Two Nights in the Morning is directed by Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be released in September 2015.
Majorca Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The perpetrators presented evidence of blackmail by police and officials of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> City Council at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police chief on Mallorca’s holiday island has been arrested for a wet celebration following allegations of corruption by the movement and bar owners in the Magaluf area.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several Punta Ballena street business owners filed charges of corruption against him. Most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the whistleblowers presented evidence of blackmail by police and officials of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> city government at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper published all over the country, wrote about the bias of the angry authorities of nightclub owners, which significantly hampered their business.
“This is no longer about money, but about survival,” one of the business owners told the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video spread online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly ordered to pay a fine of EUR 55,000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities during the 50-day Israeli-Hamas War and the schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, at the Pashosh Day Care Center, workers removed traces of fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived at the daycare facility after the rocket hit.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she felt “a little weird” when she returned to school.
“We’ve had some difficult times when we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people from communities like Saad's border had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas farther away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are sceptical about the return of the Palestinian grenade after the murder of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza Strip, which was subject to heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that “the education and safety of children will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected in Egypt later this month.
According to estimates from Palestine and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had any solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter over 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and fighting continued, the school authorities moved the start of the school last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used indicator, housing prices have risen most in the winter months of Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures housing prices in Australia’s capital, rose by 1.1% in August, according to RP’s data on Monday.
As a result of the increase, prices increased by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price growth.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest, with an average price increase of five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices only rose by 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in the sale of auctioned apartments, the generally high sales rate and the continued low interest rate, it is likely that the rise in housing prices will continue over the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual art have attracted record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta Museum was opened in June and features classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Weeks reported on Monday that they had made a visitor record when 14,500 interested people visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been shoveling through doors and windows,” says Pauli Sivonen, Director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums this year will be approaching 100 000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen points out that new museums are always opening up phenomena.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
In Mänttä, we hope that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in recent days in Kajaani.
On Sunday evening, a window broke into the commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel from the truck tank was stolen on Syväojankatu.
The boat had been taken from the boat harbour of Petäisenniska between Sunday and Monday with its outboard engines.
The rowing boat was light and yellowish on the outside of the Kalapalta brand.
On the inside, the inscription "OIVA" was written on the side of the beak.
A couple of suspects stole the police already got caught.
On Sunday evening, the commercial property was broken into in Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a trace, and a 20-year-old paltamo man was found hiding in the woods under a tree.
On Monday, police picked up another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought murder charges in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot the suspect, a 34-year-old Kajaanin woman, in a shotgun as a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the accusation and claimed that the other man with him was a shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car where a group of people were burning clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burned clothes racks, a cut-off shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu District Court will give a verdict on the case later.
August was extremely warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August occurs once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most countries, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-year-old immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between his son and his father was remote.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rapp in the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother’s death, and she ponders a lot about her relationship with her father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face never appeared, only the voice said, “Stop the noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer or the beauty of a cricketer.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelting plant in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are now better than they were then.
The melting pots today are a little brighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, pulsating with flames, smoke and soot, and reminding the mind of hell.
The father used to go to the bath and only lie down in the tub, and he slowly began to sing to himself as he washed away the dirt in the melting pot.
As I walked around the melting pot, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness of his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to feel ill a little before she died that we began to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter, Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop the hug!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from excessive weight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard may describe his change in career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making the theatre.
Next up was the comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Foundations").
Making a theatre offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedy that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A group of people noticed him on stage making imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry’s television career began in the mid-70s. “For a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV,” he says.
Henry learned to work.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes on the slides between 1975 and 1985, while I was on TV, and it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage privileges for The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people performed as black men, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and deplorable, I got to work on huge events and learned how to handle the audience.
Still, "the award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program on British TV" was at the same time "a dirty parody of black people".
In the 1980s, Henry worked in the second comedy series, which both made fun of and admired the black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known as Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the following decade on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movie parts, but after watching LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: “What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you’re just pedaling around or going sideways.”
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme in me was a source of fear.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – told me: “Try.
Do not abandon the whole idea until you know what you are talking about.
Meet the words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the document, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“That’s what this is all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
In the end, the play was a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly, I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t believe it.
At one point I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once upon a time there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“The little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to manage for 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’ ”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be continued as soon as the problem had been fixed.
I walked out of the scene, and a part of me sighed for relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
“You are part of the play, stay in your role.”
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play, too, was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Of course, Henry says this in a strange voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I truly love this work.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little humorous boys are constantly interrupting our conversation as he changes from imitation to imitation.
Staying away from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, because getting immediate thanks to an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to an impasse.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general, it doesn’t inspire me the same way as before.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on a new stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with a director who will help me shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting –
It's really fun.
I keep telling the story, and I enjoy it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya to create a register of officials to remove ghost workers
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove the "stomach workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least a million dollars was spent on salaries and other financial abuses of “honey workers” each month.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, the BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reported on the capital Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the next few weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their tasks. In addition, it will clean up wage lists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of "honey workers", says Anne Waiguru, an official in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year of Seinäjoki may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current draft budget, the annual margin is about 9.4 million deficits.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services, purchase of services, sale of assets and subsidies, and increase tax and payment revenue.
Of the EUR 10 million target, EUR 8.5 million is available for investment.
There is no relief for municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in state contributions further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategic goal,” says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The city government returned the proposals to prepare the management team.
The City Board’s proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the Council’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds to the City Board and the City Council through the panel discussion.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "drinking" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots,” local media sources say.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some police officers were involved in corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large criminal gang and tracking telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at that time) said police actions were part of the planned action against him and others in power by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexa Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at Slaviansky School, where Yatsenyuki's daughter visits, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children’s written shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry, Texas, the insulting tweet was unlicensed.
Texas Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed Twitter account sent a defamatory image of a Democratic district attorney on Sunday evening in the midst of hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the image.
Tweets were sent from my account unlicensed.
"I don't accept the tweet and I've deleted it," the later release said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
While the tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a mocking mockery of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's office funding when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's headline read: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as I can, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger at me."
I'm Texas' most drunken Democrat.
The Lehmberg Office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His powerful legal aid team has asked the judge to dismiss the allegations and said that the law under which Texas’ longest-standing governor is accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state inviolability unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led the left-leaning monitoring group to make a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa election during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself on Twitter on a floating lake with the text “Here I come, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “normal” again.
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
The capital city of London’s housing has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing widespread credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-level developer Berkeley, said on Monday that “since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal after the peak of 2013” and added that this has allowed for a “stable operating environment”.
The housing market in London went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the country register, housing prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus well above the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London real estate less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "charter tax" before the May general election.
Last week, London real estate broker Foxtons warned that a April mortgage report, which reported more stringent loan orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth, both in terms of sales volume and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
Latest data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans decreased in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices by three per cent, as the index measuring the opinion of homeowners has already started to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter year-on-year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased revenue from the properties sold to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained lively.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is nearly a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and net sales by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said that Berkeley's earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange for <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th Annual Academy Awards Ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold 100 other star photos leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures online.
The Hunger Games star’s representative confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker’s “sudden violation of privacy.”
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The photos originally released on the 4chan photo release page were apparently in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other hacked stars claims to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the pictures are real, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those who are looking at the pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mood," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right from the start.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande had denied the authenticity of the images about the star.
Only an excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter j
They dissolved, it was the best picture of what had happened, and gradually they split apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, effortless, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little thorny.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was a thorny, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had been in the early stages of a relationship that, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some content into his life.
Ailin Solomons had undressed hair and was a delicate beautician with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north that was even rougher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, in the garden grew weeds that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
Candidates will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Aininin on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to the receiver, through which the whole country heard calming music and soothing news, when Aininin’s baptized, sun-tanned feet brought to Kevern’s mind a song that had long been sung by a black-eyed one.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive, and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned—nothing was actually banned—they were just no longer played.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion produced what was not achieved by law and by proclamation: just as in literature people chose to read heroes’ memoirs, cookbooks, and romances, in music they favored the ballads.
As the day went wild, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing a serenad for Aininn’s big feet with a gruesome comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's what his father had always done before the letter "j" got out of his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of the word that started with j and didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game at the time, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t actually banned, it wasn’t just played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The cleverness had been the same.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father’s semi-detached CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for law or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted, gratefully, the principle that each group did natural things to it, as if they had been saved by trade in happiness.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean genealogy are best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the mainland of India, people were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that each family had a functional phone that was used to do things.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When those who came from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East looked at what had happened, their grandparents, who had not fled in the fear of being accused of burning flames and of being caught by the flames, opened up restaurants where they were served with shovels.
Everyone should act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard the ballads, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could never have been dressed up as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big ones.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Ainin.
Ailin thought he was weird already.
“It was fun,” he said.
Ailin shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered the field of vision of Kevern.
There's nothing to see in the whole world but Ainin's huge, crow-black hairspray.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you say so,” he said, but didn’t sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite their gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair, and at the same time poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made of only a doll, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm trees in a storm.
"And your thick head is what turns me on in you," he said.
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both because of his own words, unnecessarily cruel, and because of the fear that he saw in his eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailin think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the lush northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, cool sea that was waving against them.
The same men, though even more pale and devilish than their coyote and disfellowshipping grandparents, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he weren't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote for meaningless love balls pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
He thought it was too much, too, because already sucking in itself was hostile.
Ailin Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed his course—just as his travel companion watched Kevern go from the window upstairs—a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam was leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands to attack him.
A man who turned his back, who had lost all the will to fight—why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen it before?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event was just described, smart and enthusiastic 32-year-old scientist Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private facility measuring the General Opinion in Ofnow, made a short study of the continuation of low and moderate violence in the areas of the country where the reduction or even the cessation of violence was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been accomplished, and much has not yet been done," he wrote, "to compensate for the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and who have most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where, despite the church towers that extend over the hedges, human kindness has rarely been known in times past.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, crave stories of overcome adversity, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, while the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban commonwealths in its relentless grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more vicious rivalry in homes, in our workplaces.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked to the ground.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to assert his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are the servants of an unprejudiced society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is in itself completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as those you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
WELCOME TO WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if at all it would destroy the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, a flamingo-pink LED light announced a pattern that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the ballads, visit the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and a song is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered in a quiet voice, when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to the ONE THAT HAPPENED, IF HE HAPPENED.
This time, however, we do not pour out our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “in describing as “errors” the actions that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their “hate and mistrust on others.”
Someone in a position like you shouldn’t have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we’re not talking about ‘we’ or ‘them’.
There was nothing 'we' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether good or bad.
It was then.
We don’t have to talk about it anymore – we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share the accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what does the past exist for if you don’t learn from it?
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, when he went to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as “bad-spirited and furious.”
Chances happen.
Lesotho's military refuses to plan the attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials in the Lesotho army have denied setting up a government crackdown and said they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and taken over government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to a neighboring country in South Africa after telling them he had been threatened with death.
The army spokesman, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army responded to the threat that came from "political fanatics". The police have been said to have tried to arm the fanatics.
"Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moyela said the military’s actions looked like a revolutionary enterprise.
"While no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be the hallmarks of a similar revolutionary effort," he said.
Officials in the Lesotho army said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There has been tension in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements between the government of the large coalition.
He denies that he has so defied the power of the government, although it is said otherwise.
Microsoft to set up a data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in a Uusimaa location that the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft media, the company said it would not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It’s an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been the seat of the centre.
Microsoft is shutting down its office in Oulu, which takes about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced that a maximum of 1,050 jobs will be laid off in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company did not comment on how many employees the new data center employs.
The establishment of the data centre in Uusimaa was announced on Monday by Kauppalehti.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost around $300.
I personally took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera’s battery and other parts are sealed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera shooting settings to match the images or video you want to take.
Some cameras or camera and camcorder combinations have a setting to optimize underwater shooting conditions.
In addition, before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 feet of depth, while others can withstand up to 50-60 feet of depth.
Discover both standard and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often don’t have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
Take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for for forging, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while photographing in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important piece of advice when shooting on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire frame of the image.
China won’t let Hong Kong choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to vote for the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress of China gives the Communists the power to expel all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still outrageous," said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with an authoritarian regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidate for the Hong Kong leader would be too " chaotic".
Since 1997, with the surrender of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised residents in the region to choose their own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through the nomination committee, which is run from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the region’s largest and most prominent protests over the years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing did not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administration buildings in the rain.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would generate waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not give details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, the organizers said the movement “considers the Occupy Central stunt as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and that the taking over of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government’s main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of people arriving from the mainland has led to competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s life – the business world.
“The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will take,” says Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see the concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grip.
That would be a bad idea to invest.
There are also stories in China’s state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the backbone of the Western powers that fuel the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights with 780 000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region’s largest demonstrations for democracy.
U.S. Prom tradition strikes UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by setting up the UK’s first luxury travel mode for today’s students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart also said there was a security aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to their extremes.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet arrived because the service has just been established, but added that “students will start making orders in the next few weeks”.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of higher education, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority.”
Many people who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been lagging behind the huge increase in basic living costs. Only then can we begin to think about where to find thousands to use for something as simple as arriving at the campus.
Ipswich's "sickhouse" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house for sale in Suffolk after they noticed that a large pig was lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house with a price of <0xC2><0xA3>120,000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.

“However, the picture ended up accidentally in the notification and has since been removed,” the company’s representative says.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the real estate agent has removed the image from its website, it still appears in ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where people have been asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish attacker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement stepped in with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea has announced that it has signed a four-year deal with the French leader Loic Remy’s neighboring club QPR.
According to press reports, the transaction price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan with a two-year loan agreement.

The decision was also made by Japanese player Shinji Kagawa on a failed trip to Manchester United.
Kagawa is expected to return to the German Bundesliga Borussia Dortmund, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU transfer.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's new contract is four years old.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be Dortmund's man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment, Kagawa said.
The second Bundesliga club in Berlin, Hertha, is strengthened in Salomon Kalou.

Eleven people were seriously injured in an accident in Rosny-sous-Bois suburb on Sunday.
Rescue workers were still looking for survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but the hope of finding the survivors faded.
The initial cause of the explosion is a gas leak.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday, and was so powerful that it ravaged buildings within a radius of more than a hundred meters.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing,” said Maryline Yyvo, who lives next door to the crash site.
Emergency accommodation for the residents of the house was built in a nearby school on Sunday.

Bulgarian prison staff to hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria protested in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return to the old working rules, which were recently amended.
Wage increases will also be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours for a month, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting of the representatives of the Prison Workers' Organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, said Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, to BNR.
Members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protest of the organisation of prison workers.
Basketball: Fans almost too much encouragement: Sasu Salin had fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget his sympathies with his US match and back Ukraine’s second-half blood with his stagnant solutions.
But Salin transferred all the honor to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to go to the end of the field, it was so great.
But in my eyes, there was nothing.
The noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salini’s moments of power contained nine surfaces at a fast pace, with ball-throats, plate-throats, and taps everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode where everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now in an incredibly important place,” Sasu said.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others got caught up in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team cheerleader and spirit-creator, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the entire team to a flight that was too big and hard for the five of Ukraine.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous one reminds me of a gruesome jury game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It’s been 32 years since the Finnish men’s national volleyball team played the last time in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first block.
"In the decision-making balls of that match, the referee game was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already set in the back.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3 times, and after that the shit got more messed up," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of the head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished in 17th place.
Now Finland is once again among the world’s top picks, as Poland’s World Cup kicks off on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in the international volleyball industry over the past 32 years.
Players’ power values are roughly the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster,” thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the beginning.
It can be tough,” Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope that we'll be 17th now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari K<0xC3><0xB6>rk<0xC3><0xB6> aired in the Tunisian match.
The sauna and evening service at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

No other investments were published in the competition.

Finnish tourists rescued a Cita dog from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
In the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
In a Facebook update, Mikkelsen said that a Cita dog in the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it forward a little, but its feet didn’t just carry it,” Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
In the dark of the evening, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen and headed to their campground when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog,” Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomi in a message.
Soon there was also a German man with an excursion mattress.
From the mattress to the Cita we got a couple of similar ones that were attached to the injured dog.
The German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope in his arms for a moment,” Soini says.

The dog was brought down with the help of an excursion mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The Soini responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreached.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soini were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: "Cita is getting better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared death for years because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known to be so few.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and toes tingling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would get into a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two children says, “When I was a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several cuts of Achilles tendon to straighten his legs, and when the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he said.
When I got information from them, I was in a state of shock and panic.
I thought I would get into a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was delayed,” he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes the month of CMT to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal truck in Macedonia
The Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the Ministry of the Interior said on Monday.
The migrants were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to police, the migrants had paid around €3,000 each to get to Greece, and an additional €800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a population of a few million on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled Syria’s bloody civil war.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
The pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, in a couple of weeks’ time, the band will host a concert in Edinburgh to support the Independence Project.
A referendum on Scotland's independence will be held on 18 September.
Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for the Scots, which only happens once in a lifetime.
Previously, actress Sean Connery has given his support to independence.
For example, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In Gallup, supporters of independence have been defeated.
The difficulties of the department stores continued in the middle of summer - Homeland News - Ilta-Sanomat
The downside of the department store trade continued also in July, says Päiväritavarakauppa ry.
According to the report, the turnover of department stores and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than one year ago.
The worst has guaranteed the sale of home and leisure products, whose turnover fell by more than seven per cent year-on-year.
Clothing sales were also significantly lower than in the previous summer.
On the other hand, the value of retail sales of daily goods grew by nearly three per cent year-on-year in July.
Sales grew most in small stores and large supermarkets.
During the whole early part of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has decreased by more than two per cent.
In contrast, sales of daily goods have increased by almost one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto’s triple reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 to the Industrial Power of TVO.
According to the Areva press release, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the request for approval of the reactor’s automation systems.

Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Bottas - the value of about 60000 euros
The municipality government of Nastola donated to Valtteri Bottas a 1.4-hectare land plot on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi from Vilvalja.
The municipal government showed a fair sports spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel sounds at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Pauli S<0xC3><0xBC>irakki, the mayor of the municipality.
Bottas' gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven.
This year, the municipality will remove them, with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are pleased that he has enjoyed being born and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited elementary school every year to tell about his sports career and his life.
Hopefully it will continue, the mayor says.
The head of the municipality estimates the financial value of the beach plot to be EUR 40000-60,000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has been successful in sport with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World Champion Aki Parviainen and World Champion Tuuli Matinsalo of Aerobick got their own home plots from the municipality and built their own houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola, but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola after the work and then changed their life situation elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syyrakki in inches and believes Bottas will remain in his home municipality.
Hull washed the attacker with a record amount of Hernandez club
The Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguayan national team player Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez replaces the Hull Italian club from Palermo with <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The contract is three years old.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and entered the Italian league.
In Uruguay, he scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez entered the field in two games.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time, said Hull’s head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull announced that he had also acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian Space Experiment Failed: Geeks Sent to Sex Trip Died
The five small geckos sent by Russia into space have died, Roscosmos, a Russian Federation space agency, said in a statement.
Gekot travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning during the Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male geek and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
The effects of weightlessness on the development of geckos eggs, for example, are little known.
The effects on the geckos can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on a person in a state similar to his stay for longer periods of time, New Statesman said in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or cause of death of the geckos are investigated.
According to Interfax, passengers who were dubbed "sex geeks" were frozen.
Surprisingly, the fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 were able to cope with the trip and also had offspring.
France Arrests Terrorist Suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of working as a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities tracked him down after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French citizens or people registered in France have travelled to, returned to, or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The goal of the basketball team is to play as Finland faces Ukraine in the second game of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland would have to take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning,” Petteri Koponen predicted.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who commands Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter has been a 100-metre world champion for three years.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve been playing against them before and we have to get our standard defenses in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you that there will be a normal wolf in the field,” M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä said.
Hollywood stars allegedly infect the internet - part confirmed to be real
On the Internet, a number of nude images are spreading, allegedly representing well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a “sleeping campaign.”
TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread from her are genuine.
She had taken these pictures with her husband years ago.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble this was.
I sympathize with everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes, according to the site.
Victoria Justice, on the other hand, calls the images under her own name fake.
Authentic or fake nude pictures are also on the move, at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsk and Teresa Palmer.
Honka’s goalkeeper criticizes his own: “They don’t work hard enough to get out of here.”
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkausliiga.
The comments of Goalkeeper Walter Viitala after the Sunday VPS match describe the club’s confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But we have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a fight that ended in a 1-2-loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes, especially in the first half of the game.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not a bad defensive game in his mind.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, which is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With the player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
“Some people don’t work hard enough to get out of here sometimes,” Viitala said without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, agreed to some extent with Viitala.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you come into training and games to have fun and you think you’re a betting league player and don’t have to work, you’re probably on the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when their gamemates change constantly.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially on the defensive, people have changed.
That’s the biggest reason we’re in this position,” Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo with the second-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so there is still time for the Espoons to avoid falling to No. 1.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop it now.
We will certainly not fall from this series," the goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier to make a TV show after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to the television series.
The Danish director is preparing a television series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier’s films, told about the series at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to Zentropa, production company, the series should begin in 2016.
Trier is said to be working on the script from this autumn.
The series is in English.
Trier’s long-term partner Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, a producer known for his hard selling speeches, also tells about the mysterious project.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Keep your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series.

Isabelle Roberts a moment before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be praised for first aid.
A 20-year-old Brit who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the chin was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View of wolf howling (also): How can you explain the growth of fan numbers?
Today was a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the final tournament of the European Championship in the Marouss ball hall in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when he was there.
There were also about a hundred Finns who shouted the noise of 20,000 spectators, otherwise in an empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times as many Finnish fan troops.
The 1995 European Championship was a time of searching for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä.
Main coach Henrik Dettmann brought M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä to the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far wise, even though everything didn’t go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, the total number of Finns was estimated to be a little over 100.
This included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can tell you the exact number of Finnish cat riders.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number is, it’s an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies cross borders.
In sport, we still have the opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit to see how our girls and our sons succeed in the world,” says Professor of Sports Sociology Hannu Itkonen.
Certainly there are Finns in both Spain and Poland who are looking for an experience.
A shared experience.
It still doesn't explain everything.
In sports itself, there must be attraction.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports competitions than in Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At the time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and the players to engage in top-level sports professionally.
It took almost 10 years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were lifted to the pedestal.
The volleyball team made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen points out.
Will the ball sports be able to transfer this massive interest to the home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or slightly more than a thousand spectators.
Itkonen regards the question as good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good species.
The other school believes that interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn’t want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for the people in the middle of the drug.
Confirmation of Bottsa plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards Formula driver Valtteri Bottas on a beach plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be built on the plot.
In Nastola, Bottas has been following the success of Bottas since his karting times.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It is owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, six of which will be demolished by the municipality at the expense of the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth prize this year in Formula 1 Belgium.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and has lived in Vilvalja since childhood.
She now lives in England but visits Nastola whenever she is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are tested by the field’s ball players, but also by amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players.
According to him, the shirt helps him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the moped on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, rhythm of breathing, stress and steps.
The central unit dummy is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house hasn’t told us exactly when the shirt will start selling, nor have they even hinted at its price,” Tech Times said in a statement.
Raph Lauren is not the only smart clothing company.
Californian Athos has sold a smart shirt and shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 per piece and the size of the thumb required by the central unit costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technology.
A smart way to save money in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students in later years’ courses borrow their books in exchange for a nominal fee instead of selling the books right away.
“My book of mathematics would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, plus a cranberry sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Executive Board, an average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have access to many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books on bookstores in universities in the past spring were leased books, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online Shops
You can only get a new book in online stores for a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s ninth edition of “Calculus” is almost $290, but the book is available at Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
Books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be used at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last-year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” when used on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of Amherst's College Without Walls School at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to education.
In this case, you can only find the old print at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of a highlighter and the subsequent fees for wear and tear.
Be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes, these books are rented, which means that they are paid for the right to use the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you will receive the book Callulus as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, because several classics today can be downloaded for free, while books in the science and engineering field can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worthwhile, which option to choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start Pepperdine in law school, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can help ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure that the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to purchase the book at full price from the University bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, almost twice as many people have died from fires compared to the previous year.
According to a media follow-up by the Finnish Centre for Rescue Studies (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 fires.
At the same time last year, the number of fire deaths was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the worst situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses and seven in row and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the repetition of home fire safety.
According to Spek, at least all home fire alarms should be functional.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing equipment is readily available.
There must also be an accessible exit route for all home spaces.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport City to march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
Two teenage hikers were raised to safety after being stranded in the blue mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man left for Blackheath after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap.
The family was worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party consisting of local police and helpers was sent to look for young people, and the two were found about 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the troops were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been vehemently joining Russian tanks on the ground.
According to the army representative, the gunfire on the opponent has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
Over the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
The Ukrainian patrol vessel, which received artillery strikes in the south-east of Ukraine yesterday, sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard was not sure where the ship was shot from.
Yesterday, the separatists announced on social media that they had shot at the platform.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov insisted, however, that the Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners,” Lavrov said.
Heavy rains have flooded Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen
The streets flooded in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy rains swept southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut several roads, mixed up traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take some time to calm down the flood, even though it was predicted that the rain would stop on Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by the heavy rains, and no weather warnings were given in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates that the rainforest that plagued the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
The French socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's chief supporter said.
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" towards the socialist president in difficulty, whose new composition of the government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said, earning applause.
As a satisfying gesture, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave the French controversial 35-hour working week in peace, despite a proposal earlier this week by the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused a disagreement by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs with dissenting opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future”.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national front, ridiculed the constant division of socialists and said he did not believe the new government of Valls would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war playing, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the former did not last even for the summer.
“And the new government won’t last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and was confident of his party's election victory in the early elections, and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held a leading position in the May European elections.
According to an opinion poll published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up with several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Political scientist Pascal Perrineau of Po University warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Good morning, Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Poudan's pokka were very disappointed in the recorded part of the program.
Tomorrow Finland program released a fun video on its Facebook page last Thursday of the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Finnish advertising puff of Tomorrow from the next day’s broadcast, but the recording doesn’t go straight.
Alm-Sira is confused in his words when he tries to pronounce the word budget quarrel, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their balls over and over again.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the live broadcast even tomorrow,” says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the press photo office, finished third in the series of potrets in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had about five minutes to shoot.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
I immediately realized that I succeeded this time.
From Meiri’s point of view, the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of famous people or events.
It’s great that today you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén at the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his doctoral dissertation in computer science at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the supervision of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic data.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time allows for a comprehensive review of the law.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet"
The picture of a special announcement on the wall of the school of the Pirkkala women’s travel caused a food rush on social media, Yle says on its website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes included in the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old newspaper that is forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has led people to send angry feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Purity Services, says to Yle that the label that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there has sometimes been such an idea, which has been discussed at the time with health care.
Each student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and with a doctor’s or nurse’s certificate from the vegetarian diet.
The risk justifies the solution for Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetarian trials may leave their nutrition poor and the absence of meat or chicken may cause the pupils’ parents to wonder.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates to buy its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion. The data comes from people who are closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names public because there is no public consultation.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when its net sales amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its net sales in 2013 were $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as the middle classes of China and India in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 deal, with a value of US$850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with the merger of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo’s share of 20 per cent and private equity company TPG Capital LP’s share of 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of North American cruise capacity of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises is 82%, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise at the time of the issue of shares.
The City of Tampere will discuss this today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will strongly support the initiative.
According to the Director of Animalia, Salla Tuomivaara, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, it is important to end the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world as soon as possible.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the use of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is not animal-protectionally or ethically sustainable.
This view should also apply to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a matter of animal rights, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to the sentence, the death of Näsi-delfinin reinforces the demands for the suppression of dolphinarium activity.
The death of the Särkänniemi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It’s time to put a point on the dead, close the dolphin prison and start exploring how to transfer the Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter,” Tuomivaara insists.
The vision didn’t have time to experience the return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi were able to experience even more life than with their invigorating concrete, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia’s aim is to ban the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act being prepared.
This includes dolphins.
In support of this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will take part in a demonstration on behalf of the dolphins to be held today on 1 September.
The protest at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called on the Ukrainian government to stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of a different region, Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin’s demand for the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels on an equal footing is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists seize the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya independence that allows it to head to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with State Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to reclaim the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk territories controlled by the separatists, which were captured by the separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as the "Novorossiya", the "New Russia" – a term reminiscent of the days of glory that preceded the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks will be “illegal” as long as Ukrainian politicians conduct campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-dominated areas.
"We need to start immediately wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he said.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “statehood” is related to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need,” Peskov said.
There can be no discussion on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s mid-term remark, aimed at correcting the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s comments, stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the revolt of the separatists in the eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, which in practice occupied an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to include even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russians and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, power in an area that unites Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia’s main fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historic coastal sites.
The region between Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products that are vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the Ukrainian core region in terms of their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev government for talks with Russian-minded rebels on an equal footing after the rebels advanced last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically significant coastal area up to Crimea.
Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port town located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union on Saturday in Brussels, asking for additional measures to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there will be no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders put forward additional sanctions to enable them to be implemented if the crisis in Ukraine re-emerges in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovakia region after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers moved into the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be encircled by Russia in Ilovakis was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening goal of Milan was made by the Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari and, a little later, Jeremy Menez scored the penalty.
Lazio, too, received a hard shot at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan's former attacker Inzagh's coaching debut, the San Siro Stadium was only halfway there.
The total audience of the match was 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen the nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
There has been a surge in the entertainment world since a bunch of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were released on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity image hacking scandal.
Hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude pictures of the star Lawrence the Hunger Games, as well as other superstars such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne were apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed Grecko last month, told Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon, in New York City, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online newspaper, saying the victims “feel themselves disgraced.”
Hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on the topless pool edge.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovsky and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ that “it is a brazen violation of privacy.”
Seth Rogen became angry with the hacker in his tweet: “The release of stolen images from the phone is no different from the sale of a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like it did at home and gained a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.

According to STT, almost 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland’s victory in the Spodek arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game,” Captain Antti Siltala of Finland told STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2 in the match.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle climb from behind six points.
Cuba already led 16-10, but after that, the Finns got on top of the charm.
However, the Finnish fan was disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball players have conquered Europe at a high rate in recent days.
At the World Basketball Championships in Bilbao, Spain, more than 8,000 Finnish fans are present.
As if every Finnish basket had been the winning basket of the match, U.S. star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday’s match.
