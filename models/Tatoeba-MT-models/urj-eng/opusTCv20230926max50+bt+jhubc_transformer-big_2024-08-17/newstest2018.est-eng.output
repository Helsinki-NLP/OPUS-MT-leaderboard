Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain, who is known as Slava Kemerovsk in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community aged 27-57, who are mainly involved in drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association was arrested in Mijas, a province of Malaga, Spain.
Three men were arrested as suspects in Estonia, one of them is a leading figure in a criminal association according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the criminal community had clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal community’s activities was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal proceeds,” Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings, commented.
"We will not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also been involved in law enforcement activities in the past, and some of them have been penalized for drug offences.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has played an important role throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the detentions were preceded by an investigation that lasted almost a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realized and we were simultaneously holding suspects in crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officers were helpful in the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Spanish Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from another part of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far unequivocally indicates that, while in freedom, suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is expected to be handed over to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in the framework of this criminal case in order to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for Organized Crimes and are headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court sentenced Slava Gulevich to extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at different hotels and demanded a monthly roof charge from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and court rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight defendants of the so-called Dikayev criminal community, who were charged with criminal proceeds of 80,000 euros, or the sentence against nine persons, in 2006 that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association aimed at the illegal trafficking of cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in eastern Estonia and southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds is close to 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, carry out joint operations in any country of the European Union.
Citizens’ Rights Group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement states: “The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be especially attentive and extremely cautious when travelling around the state, given the suspicious racial events of the entire race that have recently taken place across the state and here.”
According to the NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel alert, both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases involving discrimination, and by the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are unequally targeted by minorities.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, in a statement to The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never had such serious complaints before.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he was hit by gasoline when he drove through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General showing that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers in the state.
“Note is meant to make people aware of and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state at 16th in the state’s section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it more difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to ACLU, this would increase racial profiling.
While travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, interest groups have recently begun to use this measure in response to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop further into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e., cirrhosis of the liver, and liver cancer, are considered to have a malignancy.
Health Board’s epidemiology adviser, Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also comes from the popular name of inflammation of the liver, jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can occur without signs of illness.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be identified based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without any signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the stools of an infected person to food, surfaces, objects, mouths, and drug use.
The risk group for hepatitis A infection includes family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with the infection, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travellers who visit countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated omelettes (dental brushes, shaving agents), by sex with donor blood, a person suspected of having hepatitis and from a mother with hepatitis to a foetus/non-infant.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, healthcare workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, in addition to people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from the use, tattooing and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps equipment and syringe needles, and using a condom in case of infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated omelettes, by sex with donor blood, a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother with hepatitis to the fetus/ newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug addicts, infected person’s sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, healthcare workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV-infected persons and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: refraining from the use, tattooing and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps equipment and syringe needles, and the use of condoms in case of unsafe sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
This is why hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D Hepatitis viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, by injection needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected from the mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses are transmitted by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high morbidity.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heat-treated meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid the consumption of drugs.
While in the final round, the competitors tried to push a four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the finish line and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think for long, drawing his wife Tania and children along the trail after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
“It was wonderful to be on the road with them,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth championship in London with a gold duel of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in Gold: An Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" dives much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna from the birth of a work of art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more in-depth, history.
It would have taken away the impressive amount of information, perhaps a sharper flybeam, and a narrower theme would have allowed the portrait in the title to get more impact on the extraordinary story.
At the moment, there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted in his painting "Daam in Gold", and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about respectable Jewish families and the German occupation, with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes us in the middle of the bustling Vienna cultural life, and anyone who comes into the Austrian capital can hardly imagine more than a hundred years ago how life went around Ringstra or how everyone turned their heads at Central Café when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and seeing the name in the book, you feel more grammatically cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe does not seem to add anything to the story.
Or perhaps, however - even every paired brush stroke adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna were Jewish.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, a Czech sugar magnate who had opened herself twice, and was posing for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father’s bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's entire glamorous life, which she belonged to, wasn't drawn.
When you look at "Daam in gold", it is hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order the portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order cost 4,000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house in good location.
The fact that in some portraits the master’s love affair with the model was suspected did not deter the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Dam darling.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work began with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna in the Basilica of San Vitale, and the researchers think that the brilliant mosaics seen there from Emperor Theodore gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daam in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden painting was born "Suudlus".
The art historians did not notice the resemblance of the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
“I think in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his work publicly available,” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished that their family’s Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings at the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewelry from his nieces Mary and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, he had tried to reach the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts by 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed to complete the drawing.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason why he was not accepted by Jewish professors at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria’s will had changed considerably by 1939 – it had become important to find suitable works for the Nazi Party from the rich Jewish art collections of Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art wealth was also matched by some of Adele’s work at home, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year dispute began between the Austrian government and Bloch-Bauerite heirs.
It should be noted here that if you see "The Kiss" in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then the "Daam in Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen in New York's Neue Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions after closing the book revolved around Nazi and Jewish themes more than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family fate story - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree, which was mentioned at the beginning of the book, significantly facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to Estonia’s record in Canada.
In life, Gold was very close to his personal record of 200 m of back swimming, swimming at 2.16.62.
Tippmark dates back to the 17-year-old peak of 2.16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, according to Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold reached the A-Final in the final.
In the final, he finished at a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Alina Kendzior’s record of Estonia (2.15,13) left Gold a little more than half a second apart.
Gold was ranked third in Estonia’s all-time rankings, and its fresh personal top marks are the fifth result of Estonia’s all-time ranking.
A young hope for the future is the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle at the Canadian adult championships, and 200 m and 400 m complexion.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold also made successful start-ups there.
He won the 200 m freestyle silver medal with a time of 2.03,22.
It was swimming so quickly by the Estonians in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonian record singer Elina Part<0xC3><0xB5>ka has been swimming this distance faster than Gold ever.
Estonians living in Canada also won the bronze medal in 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season top brand 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has been swimming at a distance of just one century faster.
He reached the peak of his personal reputation by receiving a letter in the opening exchange of the signaling at an additional 100 m.
At a half-long distance, he only reached seventh place when he was swimming in the finals at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen his teeth
It’s time for a vacation – that’s also relaxing for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
Since Trump has been one of the most active presidents on holiday, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
U.S. Today and CNN say the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
While the president’s vacation began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the holiday for a week.
They're throwing too much rest on Trump.
It is customary for the president to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama has been half as short as Trump for 21 days.
However, Trump quickly forgets things.
The days after he became president, Trump said in a 60-minute broadcast that there would be no time for long vacations during his tenure, as there was a lot to be done.
Three years ago, he also expressed his displeasure over Barack Obama’s vacation.
The current president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting its heads off.”
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club isn’t exactly a relaxation.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time to read or engage in other activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the holiday.
In the West Wing of the White House, the air conditioning system was replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The West Wing also houses the Oval Cabinet and other presidential offices.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the West Wing in August if there's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you’ll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Don’t Apply to the State Office if you don’t tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to bully him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that “freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and in the dark and in silence we may be led to slaughter like sheep.”
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted posts by at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU.
The Governor’s official called the action null and void, and the web commentaries chatted about the counter-reactions in the style of “Who cares?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His approval rate ranks second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a thoughtless, reactive sneezehead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained firmly established in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters quite a bit, for example, by presenting his bald head with a laziness after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, the Governor’s page, which is a public forum with official markings, is managed by a staff of taxpayers’ dollars, who are paid to block people visiting it, is unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous.
Hogan’s spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor’s behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers, or an angry crowd.
The Post spoke to a number of real people Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are, the real people who communicate with their chosen leaders, the teacher, the owner of the company and the pastor, not the internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite anger, but rather hate crimes.
“I politely told him that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in The Post’s news bulletin.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone immediately calls it an indifferent collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a large number of citizens’ concerns.”
What the governor’s officials called a “directed spam attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past, when workers had to be sent out to do the same, so that they could gather newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
This is what is happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media outlets toothless.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the first significant judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the Constitution’s first amendment when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) after using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable mail costs had a similar effect to the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers bore a strain on his leadership.
And even then Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected within the framework of the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, his cabinet buried under petitions that criticised his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the cornerstones of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for Homeland Comfort at Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, the former European leader, hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days, when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the Archerfield Links tracks in the neighborhood last year before Paul Eales took the lead in the final round, has become fond of a new venue and will play the role of an ambassador to the tournament instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
“I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see the club glowing in full glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
“Players see the trail in its best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done a great job in building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This will make it possible to show the trail perfectly.”
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from the competition calendar a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour at the beginning of the year when he was 50, returns home.
It is his first event in Scotland after attending the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you also feel extra stress.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and I’ve shown a pretty good golf game.
I am happy with the way things have been going so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses the pot.
Indonesia’s reluctant Papua province, in a wooden cabin in Enarotal, the capital of the Panic Regiment, places the bata, which is called nota in the local language, directly at the fire station.
After half an hour, the carbonized tuber is removed from the fire and gently injected with unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on a muddy floor with no furniture, and he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is performed by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of the four wives of his wife, he has not been appointed to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous, however, most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, in addition there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to go to the village after five o’clock,” he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the life of the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that forced only 1026 elderly people to vote in front of the army.
The movement that prompted the Dutch to get out of control quickly turned its rage against the government of Jakarta, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is a remote and deserted place in the same way. To get there, you need to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire for 90 minutes, and then take a five-hour journey to nausea with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, whose rust has turned different shades of yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” says Degei, referring to his colourful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a precious land in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company.
In 2015, Freeport alone mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of its commercial wood reserves, which are estimated to be worth $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the popes, as they result in a suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military and military units around US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 for one officer.
The pope’s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold geese and they are ruthlessly renegotiated.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of the Papua tribes in the highlands in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the Archbishopric of Birsbane, “We will lose everything” includes testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because such incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even more tightly closed, as the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the busy islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The Javanese family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals cannot compete with them.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local beans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital for work.
"The oil-smelling beans of the papaya ma-ma'd [women] therefore lose their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of the 29 constituencies in Papua, including Pania, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” You says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was in a low position.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang Christmas songs at the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses say drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, Yulianus Yeimot, aged 16, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to demand justice on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They wore ceremonial hunting legs and performed the waita dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and mimicked the birdsong.
Some protestors started throwing stones at the police and the military.
When the evil spirit was aggravated, the soldiers were sent an order via the internal radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, let them down," it was said, according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not published to local media outlets.
Yerimias Kayame (56), the elder of the district of Kego Koto in Enarotal, felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the veranda of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a lot of people, there was a lot of shooting,” he adds.
Alfius Youw, a local man, was shot three times by a cousin who saw him shoot.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes told TIME magazine, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates would only return to the security of their station because it was attacked.
“We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed,” said Pudjo Sulistiya, a police spokesman in Papua.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to deal with abuses in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extra-judicial mechanism to solve the crimes against human rights committed.
But almost immediately there were excuses as well.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes,” he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be resolved by law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of the Panic victims accepted such claims with gloomy distrust.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He said that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to break down this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he had helped bury four victims.
“After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me,” he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deiya, a neighboring police station in Pania.
One person died and 17 were wounded, including children, when a conversation broke out between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at police officers, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," said Time, 29, in the journal Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and sees the injured being carried in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the police’s mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds on the discontent of the Mee, many, Dani and Damal tribes living in Papua delirium.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) rebel army, which, according to them, defends the rights of the popes by conducting occasional attacks and abductions among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military has arrested thousands of people in Pania over the past few years on the pretext of "defence of the sovereignty of the country".
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the papal people, Paniaid is known as "a tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
The small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food on their own mainly in the form of sweet potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five batadium fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten batats cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous popes and new migrants who have been arriving since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport has deepened.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthy migrants.
The popes themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Panic Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on foreign media.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they "did not follow the relevant practices" even though they were given a rare filming license.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of the Human Rights Watch Asia department, Jokow’s election promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to do reports from the most troubled provinces of Papua and Western Papua are threatened with new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said.
The lack of an eye-catching look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the neighboring Papua.
In March, six Pacific states in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “many large-scale crimes” in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arnmanatha Nasir, dismissed the group’s accusations, saying in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, democratic order and freedom of the press still apply, so that the evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to bury.”
Locals want to see more foreign governments.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country’s human rights envoy Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted the meeting, but according to the source who wished to remain anonymous, said their silence, urging: “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," said Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to tell Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from the misery of poor educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other popes, consider the vote given to his Jokowi to be a debt he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic reluctance to bury the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on the ground, they will at least not let those responsible forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” Yacobus said with a lowered head.
“What else can we do?”
Dubai Torch skyscraper swallows itself for the second time
The fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to escape from this 337-meter-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has destroyed a high-rise building in just two years, sometimes called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were reported.
“We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident told Reuters, calling himself George.
Dubai civil defense officials said the firefighters extinguished the flame at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
A study conducted by the board of Torch after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was the decorative panels and insulation of the facade covering - the exterior surface.
British police have said they believe that the isolation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place there in June, killing around 80 people.
See: These phones are likely to be selling in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were released in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to be released in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, the innovative design of the flagships of this year is characterised by an eye-catching scanner, a 4K-resolution display on the edge-to-edge, and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great success in the technology world, which has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
In autumn, smart enthusiasts can enjoy even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and increased water and dust resistance.
He added that based on rumors, assumptions can already be made and four top models can be predicted, which are likely to take over the sales charts this year.
These top four models of smartphones will be available to the poets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the shelves as early as mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what you can do with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to the iPhone 6s, Apple’s 10th birthday is expected to see the new model stand out completely from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen covering the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple’s design manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There is also the case of the iPhone’s ceramic version.
In addition to an eye-catching scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The pre-order for the new Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to be designed for even more business users, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, it’s Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year with the Nokia 6, it still lacks its flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be launched on August 16.
We expect Nokia to have a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia is also talking about the aluminum housing and the significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, the Nokia new model has two rear cameras manufactured by Zeiss.
With Sony’s solid flagship so far XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future with even more innovative features.
We’re looking forward to a smartphone that’s a bit more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches tall.
What the reality is, we can see soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair (IFA), which will take place from September 1 to September 6 this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post published the transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and the heads of state in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president slammed the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump has pledged his presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vows to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take over refugees heading to Australia was "smiling," "sudden" and "ugly". He claimed that the agreement made during Obama's administration would leave him "sudden" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by announcing to Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not consider a complaint in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linna Lines on the Tartu bus contract because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Aputin, the head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is a public bus transport project within the City of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not proceed with this.
While many on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken parties, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the beach festival.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurryness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," said Laine.
“It’s nice to come, be and feel the joy of Pärnu, which has remained like winter,” he adds cheerfully.
The tedious Laine sleep from the beach doesn't bother you.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music is playing on the beach, the music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope I can hear you," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who has also spoken with <0xC3><0x95>htuleht, says that the big festival is better for Pärnu - it helps local merchants to make a great deal of money.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The noise of the parties does not disturb the woman.
Although I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach has been revived.
“It’s great that people are moving and that’s been the case three times,” she says.
The first time was a little worse.
“There may have been complaints,” he thought.
However, the noise on the beach is normal for the summer mayors.
"This Weekend is a very good promotion for our small town," says Harri, who is washing in the park.
Noise and noise have not hit his rhythm.
What's up?
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
A man of loud music is not crushed.
That doesn't bother me, even though I live near there.
“Good people can save and there’s no problem,” he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite.
“Of course, they’ve exaggerated a little too much with bottles, but young people are young and God – let’s go, but be human and we’ll get along!” he says.
The residents of the coastal area have traveled away, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s dream of festival music doesn’t bother him either, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer there was a different stage, then we heard more.
We live outside the city itself, so it really feels pretty good on the side of the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revitalize business
British education firm Pearson said Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the business’s impending austerity.
According to CEO John Fallon, jobs that are likely to be lost at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 will be added to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US$394 million) under the third cost reduction program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month said their expectations for the year have not changed since a 1 percent increase in sales revenue was announced to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said the Thursday afternoon explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a “human-carrying self-made explosive.”
According to the statement, all of them are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO in Baghdad.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% have been killed in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul, mainly in the Shiite region.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people – the most deadly military attack in the country since US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
According to Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the suspensive order
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has cancelled the decision to delay the adoption of an Obama-era regulation obliging states to limit the emissions of wolves one day after 15 states sued the agency for this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the “2015 Ozone Determination Actions” late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA’s intention to postpone the determination of ozone levels by measuring the level of pollution from different parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year until October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
15 mostly democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to reverse a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which is part of a broader plan to boost growth.
But these efforts have led to counter-reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases,” such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle can have a party as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be the case that the rain showers that have lasted for weeks before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
“The quality of the woman is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015,” said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go into animal feed, which is double as compared to normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which continued in August.
Many have turned their eyes to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only 5 percent of the wheat has been harvested.
The majority of the region has not yet begun harvesting, the local collector Ceravis said.
“It’s a pretty complicated day,” said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader in Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, or clever swings in the interior design of Finns
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairhouses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, the efforts of our northern neighbours to create both rough and perfect (energy-efficient) homes will be taken into account.
The Finnish wood use skills as building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are worth admiring as well as following.
Vibrating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fairhouses by both the builder and (home) designer.
It is evident that black, white and grey hues, when supplemented by wood shades and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night before today, the line was drawn down to this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix did his best to remember the latter as a performer.
At the time of Garrix’s performance, the people were in a real turn – singing, singing, singing, dancing.
When Garrix finished, the joint mass was spread from Pärnu beach to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught in the weekend for three days.
You must be one of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the most attractive boxing match of the near future in the weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN’s office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision to win over former four-time world champion Adrian Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters will be in the top five in the weights.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19:00 on ESPN.
When a couple pose for the photos, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a “perfect measurement”.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he must move upwards with a light weight [61,2 kg], and then we can fight.
The fans wanted it.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch it. This is part of his strategy to let Lomachenko debut in class 61.2 kg towards the end of this year in order to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nokuts) next summer, who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's winner after their lightweight title ceremony on 23 September.
"Watching this fight could be a paycheck because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go to see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in his praise for Garcia, saying that he thought the three division champion from Riverside looked out "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that nap."
Garcia said the goal was to show the impact strength and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension between them growing.
“It’s a battle waiting for realization.
No other confrontation produces so much attention and summation.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
What parts of the world are being moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, almost 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, but in recent years, this number will be close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine – 1087 people received a temporary residence permit in 2014, a year earlier, 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is increasing the most – last year, 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many others are already in front of the family,” said Kristin Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had been granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter was the highest in ten years.
If Ukrainians come here mostly to work, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Academy of National Defence.
“If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonia’s residence permit have moved to, then immediately after Harjumaa, Ida-Virumaa is,” he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits decreased.
“The fee is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia,” Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, explained, according to whom the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia’s residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to promote the survival of adapted people.
A long-term resident’s residence permit, for example, requires five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased as a result of the new residence permit.
For example, last year 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can exchange jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer be able to put a finger on whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became very popular - applicants last year were still holders of a grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people received residence permits for settling in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to the study migration.
They are also subject to the rule that where the community has emerged, it will be easier for others to come to it,” Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, as well as from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even with the inclusion of citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at around a percentage point,” Maasing said, commenting that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people travelled to Estonia last year and 13,792 from here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the expatriates and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the expatriates.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was low with 2,000 people.
Estonians migrate primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
For Maria Tammeor, however, there is a history in the ingenious spirit of ideas - old paintings and costumes: "I could dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study it and learn more about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how bright your life is!
I have a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can make your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this thought that made a rolling plan to bring high fashions to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people that fashion often does not reach.
Mammu’s collection was presented in V<0xC3><0xB5>ru, J<0xC3><0xB5>hvi and Pärnu Fashion Fair, where the royal dephiles filled the whole street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, people often get into the shop, nod with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - they shout braavo, they stand up, they want to thank you with their hands.
The majority of the audience just came to reform, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they’ll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they would never end!
Maria also does not recognize the fashionable fact that the creation must be presented by a supermodel, she likes to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
This is such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my own show, I’m always behind the stage to give the last sand on things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't let me watch the hall calmly.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who not only wants to play the role of representative, but wants to be in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I make myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I’m never far from my work and I’m not afraid of work.
It is not limited to design, including stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into the day of a single temperamental woman.
These days, there is a lot of work going on for fanatics.
I can’t tell you when my work day will end, it’s just a day full of joy for me!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and in turn compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The lavish tedious satires that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp of the U18 boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament weapon was turned against us now
Sorry, the fairy tale is over.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn’t get our table.
And if there’s such a big difference at the table, there’s nothing to do,” commented Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp, our only basketball player who played in the NBA, commenting on the failure of Estonian U18 basketball players 61:75.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up the defense.
In defense, however, they were able to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It hit the team's feet.
The home work of the opponents was better done.
According to M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the enemy’s momentum.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and the tight intrusion that was our weapon in the sub-group tournament now turned everything against us.
Today, we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his diligence in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day there was a uniform punchbox.
It's a shame you've met an aggressive opponent like this before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has been carrying a pretty heavy load.
But he made some pretty moves that I've seen in training before," the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: The women's basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the European Championship...
In the U18 age group, not only do the European Junior Championship B-Division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started the day before in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, was in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, that is, only in the last ten minutes did the opponents take their foot off the gas pedal, and that period was 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters Estonia scored 4 points, in the third 1 points...
At first, the Estonians hit two of the first four throws in two minutes, then 25 of the game, then one of the three, and then another 21 of the throws.
In almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was hit.
In addition, two points came from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of complaints at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a throw-off rate of 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two defeats, the opening day had to recognize Portugal’s 83:56 best.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish ships’ supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for their return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days of vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future operations in the search for historic explosives.
"Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they carry out in local waters is a good expression of our integration with the Allied forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, chief of the operational and planning department in charge of the Navy's fleet.
From 29 June, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group will be led by Latvian naval commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of group commander from Estonian naval officer Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa at the ceremony held in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group’s command.
During this half-year, the international unit will also include the Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of ships under the command of the NATO Marine Command, NATO’s 1st permanent mine-control group is one of the first rapid reaction preparedness units, which the Alliance may deploy in five days to various parts of the world.
From 4th to 13th August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was founded 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The opera world classics include "Travitaa" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is also no lack of self-production of the program, which this time is the performance of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "The Seasons" by the same international creative team who brought Pirtal to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It’s bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose charms take over and never really let go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas' shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my leadership career.
Perhaps it is because of this that it is easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course it will pass on to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren will be presented.
That's "Karlsson's flying."
And one of the curios nuances of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
He must have had Karlsson's character in his soul since he was a child.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a pile of it.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people as much on myself, that is, how I’m going to go against every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, maintaining positivity, and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my happiness rate.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it particularly avidly and it works.
A smile activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don’t know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor's desk?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to interact actively with people, even before I step into the conductor counter.
But come all to Birgitta Festival, here’s what to discover for a friend of the not-so-great opera and ballet!
Watch a great video with Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a novel approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were assessed older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judiciary (Rätsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of age in the asylum application process after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly minor refugees.
To date, migrationverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was rated 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test could be “aged 18 or older.”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used if the age of the person is under question.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to previous months’ statistics, the numbers are fairly consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said 442 cases “have indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older.”
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, which makes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing human biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the measurement method we are currently using should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
“If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t make a face that we can,” he told Metro.
But Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, it can be said that the risk of an inaccurately adult dilution of a child is low.
The highest risk, or about 10%, is when a person is a little under 18.”

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old hammersmith, made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, scoring a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was M.M.M.’s youngest female vassal donor, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80), I immediately scored my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
Rainfall did not disturb Orel, because he trains through winter at the TUT stadium.
"I'm tough," he said with a little mule.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him, or was he able to shut himself down?
I realized, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more – that’s it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with M.M.M.’s debut, and he is still looking forward to a lot of good races: “I came here with the 32nd or final result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm at M.M. It's the only thing that matters.
I have a good experience and some days I want to compete for the medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Exchange
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change parties.
“Whether I like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me,” Justice said.
“Today I tell you, having prayed and thought about it a lot... today I tell you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
There was joy in the gathering.
“I’ll be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I’d tell you it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that “the exchange of the party with Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from making a better country than working for it.”
“Of the 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is out of control and unable to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
It’s no surprise that where there are a lot of people, there are also a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who was in charge of the medical tent at the weekend, told <0xC3><0x95>htulehti last night that they had to distribute quite a lot of the patches.
Wilds and abrasions are basic, out of twists and slight falls.
Head, back and leg pain, of course.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that’s how problems come.
Doctors have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do smaller stitches here, bigger ones we'll send to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if a painkiller is also asked by the festive medics for the treatment of pohmel.
Coe praised the Russians for their honest apology for the doping scandal
International athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia’s “T Thursday honest apology” for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it is not time to allow the country back into the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian athletics nanny, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country had been banned from the competition and had a firm goal to combat doping.
He apologized to "all athletics players who have been stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban on competition, which was imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they have had quite a difficult time and will do everything possible to reorganise the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that it is not the right time to take Russia back," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want clean athletes to be separated from the ruined system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet IAAF’s strict criteria compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of restoration criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control is still inadequate and that the banned coaches are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies won’t help.
Glencore currently serves coal and oil, but in the future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the electric car era.
This year, decisions by the UK, France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have increased their contribution to the spread of electric cars.
That’s why Volvo has already announced that they’re planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance estimates that electric cars will be sold more than oil-fired cars in two decades.
“With regard to some metals, this changes everything,” said Simona Gambranin, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
More copper is needed in charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will receive revenue from the rising trend in electric cars from the copper price increase and the fact that it is the world’s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group said.
The other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has raised 70 percent of the cobalt.
Last year’s price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 percent in London, surpassing Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side there are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who need to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the power-supply batteries for starters in petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand,” said Michael Widmer, chief metal market analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the volatile trend has not yet been noticed in the form of lead price movement.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal in London, amongst the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems with metal in the distant future.
“I’m not sure it’s that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition,” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of metal broker Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
This could happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, however, stricter exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars will increase, which will depend on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine start-ups, according to an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand from 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world’s total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen by 13 percent this year, as increasing demand from car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce super-light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum.
"Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet said: "Exane BNP Paribas should be the answer to this development.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
“Many raw materials that are currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahldah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than fully electric cars in 2025.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers over the next 10 years is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos have developed hydrogen-based cars that depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Diisel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Brunet of Paribas, Exane BNP.
German car manufacturers were hit hard in July because the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the home city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How Football Finance Rules Affect Neymar’s Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record transition from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain in Barcelona, France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game, and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP) established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to at some point prove that the Neymar transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) solely to buy out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar’s salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s transition to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to withdraw such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its starry lineup, given that the team is funded by Qatar’s energy crime ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into large debts in search of success actually deal with fraud and risk decomposition if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring the losses rather than the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to make a huge expense to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgraceful rejection of the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, a supervisor at the UEFA FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
While the PSG paid Neymar for the takeover clause as a single full payment, it is possible for them to divide this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the transitional fee for the next five years as an amount of EUR 44.4 million per year.
With the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Manchester City, Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined €60 million (at this point $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was blown up.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG's services could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador of the World Cup, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar in advance with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG generated a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent the transition of Neymar, claiming that PSG was violating FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'money doping' with the club and the state," President of the La Liga Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the country is funding the club.
“This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country."

Today 50 years ago: hurricane-scale storm in Estonia, which ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, which was called the storm of the century, caused great damage to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
During those days, the wind speed in north-west Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and touched his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and quiet, like the end of the world.
In 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu reminded Estonian Nature magazine in an interview.
Linda’s husband saw her garden collapse.
But what do you do to support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, splashing in the water from the windows,” said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the apron at the railway station had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalus, just like most of them, the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were down in the northwest, some completely lying down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through the beautiful old trees with ragina and pragina like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa could not suffer much in the August storm of 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also great there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were demolished from the ground, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of 6 August, a little girl in Merivälja, Tallinn, called out: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be down!” wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The P<0xC3><0xB5>ll manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to demolish it later.
The construction of the T<0xC3><0xBC>ri ski jumping hill did not withstand the Augustitorm, which was later not restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the harvesting of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the cleaning work.
In the storm, the crops were also severely affected, and the newspaper reported that "partisan primary organizations must be instigators and guiders in both the reorganization work and the harvesting of the crop."
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of wind blowing in Estonia will remain as of 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the meter broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Beaches: Night Cleaning and Poor Beach View
Colder summer weather also means a smaller amount of cleaning effort in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
“If there is a weather, people are on the beach, and if there is not, there are no people,” says the beach cleaner.
On the North Tallinn Stroomi beach, the kayaks scream.
They are provided with melodic competition on low turns of the bumpy tractor, which gnaws stripes on the plaza.
In fact, the last one sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimetres, picking out sea debris and left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigars, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, head of beach cleaning at Haabersti Administration.
It's 6:30 a.m. and there's a bitter cleaning at the beach, because at 8:00 a.m. the place has to be fine for people.
Usov's on duty at four o'clock.
Besides Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beach.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago, there was so much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beach for 15 years.
When something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now we've got what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter, or adru, which has been washed to the shore.
For example, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tonnes must be transported to the beach season.
“This is an incredible amount,” says Usov.
Another major category is household waste, that is, all that people leave behind.
The 1.5-kilometer Stroomi beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much garbage going on.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the amount of garbage is one-fifth less than otherwise.
The third species consists of abandoned things.
They are mostly children's.
This time, Usov has shoveled dozens of model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"They usually come out more often, but this is a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Waste is scattered
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the tractor’s screening work disturbs the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
This work is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't do that, the district will fine us," Scholler said.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the aim is to get Stroomi Beach under the international quality label of the blue flag.
“Compared to Europe, there is a lot more work to be done in Estonia to maintain the beaches,” says Scholler.
We have more adru and stones and it's harder to sift the sand.
There is less waste on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, listens to the talk of garbage on the beach, he unforcedly steps into the conversation of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled trash bags upside down," Martin says.
While it’s hard to assume that people can change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with garbage cans and put lids on them, for example, to prevent at least birds from renovating there.
In general, Martin is pleased with the development of the Stroomi beach.
The city will take care of it.
With children’s playgrounds, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, the rollerblades could only be driven on one road,” Martin notes.
Findings of treasure trombone in Stroomi: coins, only coins
In the morning, a 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use a treasure chest to comb the shore edge with a metal detector.
He doesn’t think he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been doing this for a year and I haven’t found anything valuable so far,” Dmitri says.
As a hobiaardek<0xC3><0xBC>tina, Dmitri's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottled ores, and also dangerous nails, which later throws in the trash.
Usually there are coins.
"There's usually no gold, no rings or anything like that," says the treasure trove.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the same level as the weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as the household’s tight incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 ratios at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast by 1.7% and its 2018 growth forecast by 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary in the next few years to curb inflation caused by Brexit, and the financial markets may need a higher than expected increase in loan costs.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will close a fixed-term funding scheme in February, offering cheap financing to banks, although it said that it is now expected to offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this scheme, i.e. <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: "The average forecast of the MPC will remain ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
With regard to rates, it was reiterated that in order to mitigate inflation, it is necessary to 'push up some of the financial policies' and 'somewhat more' than the markets are expected to do.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting its first increase in the third quarter of next year and its second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to those for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained unchanged.
After this news, the pound’s exchange rate for the dollar and the euro fell.
The nail dropped 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened the growing expectations of GDP growth in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to pick up slightly.
The Bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to welcome households suffering from rising inflation and a relentless rise in wages, saying that the situation would get a little worse before it got better.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit on income in the next few years, but a significant wage recovery is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the rates were taken in August, 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully blow up prices and the economy.
Before the Bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for a rate increase, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policymakers called for a rate increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to do so, and in the coming months it is expected to rise again.
The bank said that the excess increase compared to the 2-percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Mortgage Brokers at Coreco, said: “Given the recent drop in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be getting more and more competitive again, as lenders are looking forward to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to come to an end, as refinancing, often without a fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.”
The NHS is writing a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people.
Since September, patients have access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that it is now estimated that during the initial three-year clinical trial, public health will make available to 10,000 people pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets, which are administered prior to intercourse and have shown a reduction of approximately 86% in the risk of infection in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the appeal court supported the Supreme Court’s decision last year that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency’s own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this move, which was announced Thursday, as a “new major intervention,” while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as “a pivotal moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and who do not receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor will also be able to register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after an international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of mankind’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: “This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and are part of a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk for HIV in England, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Managing Director of Terrence Higgins, said: "It is now vital to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is pushed to speed and that no HIV risk group member is left behind.
Now that PrEP clinical trial drug has been acquired, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow Minister of Public Health, said: “The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delay and dragging the feet of the government.
Evidence shows how big changes this drug can bring to the prevention of HIV and its cessation of the spread of life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to understanding the full benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while prices in Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity on the next day’s stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish association.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity on the stock exchange was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the hours of the previous month moved from Estonia to Finland and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place on the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia 99 per cent of the time, and 73 per cent of the hours were spent on total transmission capacity.
According to transactions in the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price could be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of CO2 affecting the production price of electricity increased last month and the transactions were carried out at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living high - half-floor and smart design tips have made this little Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded her big Knightsbridge home in 2014 for Earls Court's apartment.
It’s located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and Joanne’s failure to pack her bags and resell her apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface,” Joanne said.
“I’m looking for something that’s equal to the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
“That was my demand,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“The metal structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We had to rearrange the rooms so they would be on top of each other without having to bow down.
It wasn’t just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to make the height of both the upper and lower rooms right.”
This setting allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms on top of each other in the room, with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half-floor you can find the glamorous living space under the view of the old-fashioned copper-light Retrouvius window.
Gold furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro-sounding Serge Mouille luminaire emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light-filledness.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The charm of the living room adds the possibility to close the kitchen part if not used, creating an image of a glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact about this kitchen that it is a garage type lift-up door.
“It took a bit of a design gap,” explains Erfan, a veneered MDF door.
“It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily when you push it up.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, the floor area is what you sell — or what gives value to the property,” says Erfan.
"A real estate broker steps into the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here, they have been able to increase the floor area by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are the ones you touch that help create an emotional connection to your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It is important, but it does not make the tongue of the heart ring.”
This shows that good design and increased area will help to make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in the Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for promotion.
It does not count anything but the amount of money earned, along with which all ethics are forgotten.
He sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it’s a version of the “Cardhouse” business world – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech manager are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-house element remains, and the moralizing intent of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
For a life-changing experience, the protagonist's son's illness becomes cancer.
The choice between work and family life has to be made.
A son who dreams of being an architect makes his father’s walk to Chicago’s large buildings think about truly important things like faith, goodness, love... without even touching the Twin Towers disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry for sure, because even the most stubborn-hearted viewer is unable to hold back tears in the face of the suffering of the beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immorality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now I bet on myself - if the movie has a happy ending, I reward my perceptiveness after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, I can praise the screenwriter for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm missing a coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes slowly down the hall.
However, the son has been miraculously healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it also turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too – I can predict the end of American drama pretty well!
The film is well designed, and all the elements necessary for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
This movie will probably bring you in well.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the President’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information, including news, that will reach President Trump, in the hope that it will keep the chief in smoother water.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
When White House’s new Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first working day, he pointed out a key problem at President Donald Trump’s White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information had to go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven’t gone anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, he was paid to show that he was also honestly reflected in the affected publications,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
According to Politico Tara Palmer, “six former campaigners say the key to managing Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a strong sense of praise.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s use of Twitter has ever been “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tweets would have been even more flammable without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
When his assistants were able to save him a couple of times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people are exclusively trying to advance their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be trustworthy.
In May, Politico wrote about the tendency of counselors to feed the president with information of strategic questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may respond to a negative press, especially harmful news leaks, explosively, with an obsession with identifying their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gave the President a horribly printed copy of an article on the website GotNews.com, which belonged to Charles C. Johnson, which accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the White House’s “source of multiple communications.”
It doesn’t matter if Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of a mockery, or if he didn’t provide any concrete evidence, or if he’s been making false accusations in the past and taking them back.
Trump read the article and began to inherit Walsh from his subordinates.”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and Rob Porter, head of the White House Office, “have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trump.”
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad do not obtain permission to perform bitterly.
There are a lot of foreigners playing in Tallinn city centre.
Those with whom <0xC3><0x95>htuleht talked admitted to playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with bandmates and explosive clothing were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the group played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to her was juggling three balls and calling the passers-by closer.
A third man was sitting next to them on a backpack and smoking a twisted yarn in his heart.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob juggling the balls, said they were playing music on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the Society’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the same day.
When asked if they asked permission from the city to play in the old town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most often give permission for a month or something.
There’s no point in paying for that,” Bob said.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved to the junction of Viru Centre with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet, and the third had even carried an electronic piano.
“We’re here to entertain people to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living,” Mivosh explained.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the city government must have a permit to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we’ll go elsewhere, but we’ll have to try,” he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million under the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks in July, while the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about the purchases.
In response to the interpellation of the members of the Riigikogu, the President of the Estonian Bank Hardo Hansson has explained that the Eurosystem central banks’ asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, ABSs and public sector bonds (PSPPs).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, the return on lower-risk assets decreases and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, under the public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, while other national bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia will make so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as part of the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds.
As of June, both Elering and Eesti Energia will be bought by the Finnish central bank on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "Millionaires' Division"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have come back into a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field near the wealthy “millionaires’ district” of Solihulli Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks since they were only kicked out of there in May, without letting themselves be disturbed by the ditch that was dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot at the perimeter of the defense, pinching their vehicles from the unblocked part left on foot.
The inhabitants of Maruvihas are accursed by the council of Solihulli, saying that the council is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The migrants were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came in last night, probably even more today.”
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I am not happy that I have to continue to pay the council tax if the council is not even able to prevent such a thing.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and a new offensive is already taking place.
This time the number has increased, and in the grasslands even the horse has been remembered."
A representative of Solihulli's council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we work with Solihulli's police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.”
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the three days of the festival.
However, he admits that the real players of his field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our place," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists at the festival speak the most about themselves?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record twist, all of us have turned our feet at some point,” he says.
However, he also mentions several other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.
Take a closer look at the <0xC3><0x95>htulehte video!
Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of car manufacturers' criticism
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it was offering software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW’s Chairman, the company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these activities as recalling.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, which were silent about the use of so-called cheating devices, which allowed the emission reading to be adapted to the regulations at the time of testing the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former president, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation involving Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European exhaust emissions requirements, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a huge blow for Volkswagen’s luxury car manufacturer to generate a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s profits.
European Union flags are purchased for 20 000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres will be awarded to 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are intended for display indoors, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment indoors with tunnel mounting, the ERR news portal reports.
The flag on the label reads: "The gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros on the price of the Ministry of Education, which means that one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing threat situation in Mexico
The Riodace staff of the weekly newspaper usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two senior writers discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "aliens".
They ask reporters to provide names in each column without the need for evidence, impressions and intuition are enough.
There is a suspicion that drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are making it dangerous to report chaos in Mexico.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the greater the number of bodies accumulated across the country, the greater the number of journalists who have been involved in violence since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under national protection since the attacks and threats, and so far this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest deaths include their editor and inspirational source, Riodace co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence makes him feel deeply, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodace building hanging a large picture of Valdez, the middle finger, with the letter "Justice", and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts with his smiling glasses on their face or a panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been taken to court.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce’s editorial continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, the security meeting, Ibarra said, will not be of much use.
“It’s very silly to waste your time at this meeting,” he says.
"Until the cause is known, you'll distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodace office in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him at the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is expected due to the name of the newspaper, which translates as the "twelve river".
The gunman drove off in Valdez's car and crashed near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country because rival cliques are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter if a person or even several people are shot every day on Sinaloa streets, or if the cemetery is crawling with richly decorated double-deck mausoleums of drug lords that are larger than the homes of many living people.
For a moment, let us forget that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel controls a state on the seaside with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers inherent in his work, Riodace's co-founder and manager, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a man who competes with Guzman’s sons and is currently on the war stage.
This piece may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid took place in another newspaper editorial that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 units.
Bojorquez said in Sinaloa that "it was impossible to deal with the press without addressing the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship and readers in a lums print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Prize (AKK) for his courage to follow Mexican drug lords wherever they lead.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the AKK prize.
In an interview last October, he told Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on the task that comes with the journalist’s office the second way is to play dumb.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodace collective longs for Valdez, a joker who roped like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared emboss and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the street from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also caused them to doubt how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like being stuck in these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things should not be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is even in the best times a strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodace editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is that "the smell can be tricked... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or in other states that are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoc's employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whose governor himself had described as unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous areas where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
This week’s edition of Riodoce dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write down what everyone in town knows about the restaurant is a favorite spot for drug dealers and authorities alike.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in cases of widespread coverage.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We'd sooner have known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose kleenuke physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has become a storage space for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected from activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
The body has been burned, and officials say it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and criticize the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest to walkways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is out in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support in order to establish justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, Ramirez accused reporters of spying and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from the government’s activities to reflect, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, complicit state officials, and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narcotic Journalism, he wrote that reporters not only kill drug gangs, but also do so at the command of politicians and security forces who are in a gang of organised crime.
Last year, the Media Channel Monitoring Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks by journalists to police and state officials.
“You’re going to die because you’re going to be silenced,” Ramirez said.
The killings are clearly bloody.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, a northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter supposedly signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his beheaded head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue to do what the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly on the front cover of the drug cartel with the editorial "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
This is a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find a job in Ecsil and they still have to hide in the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a 2015 Mexico apartment three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stand still and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that his portrayal of a drug business scares him.
“Mexico is on its way to hell and that’s why I started reporting,” he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodace editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as they suddenly started vibrating all their phones.
In the seaside resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed to have died in firefighting between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as many of the messages left by the cartels found in the region promised.
On the same side of the walkway, reporters posted the news using their mobile phone on the Riodace website.
The next day's cover needed to be changed.
The sirens were raving about another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez was hiding in front of the guards to see if they were on guard.
When they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, on which his average finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, Riodocé’s workers followed in his footsteps.
“How could I even think about closing,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to do a report?”
Dinosaur used protective paint to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, although quite scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
It is so well-preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with her scales was reddish-brown and her past had been somewhat “difficult”.
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the entity as "the best-preserved genus dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
The preservation of this incredibly good caught the attention of scientists who describe it as "very significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this scales-covered vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of this type ever found.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 when he mined Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray, near North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the stone around him, and decided to investigate further.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were spent digging the animal out of 2500 pounds (1,100 pounds) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready to be made public.
“When you cry a little, you can almost believe he’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore, though covered with scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be significantly endangered by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This richly armored dinosaur used a red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique called counter-intelligence, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to better blend in and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs likely hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old creature from the genus of nodosaurs first reached the news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Mark Mitchell Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the team of international scientists were able to document the shape and size of scales on the animal’s body.
They discovered counter-intelligence - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although counterintelligence is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealope is much larger than today’s animals living in counterintelligence.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred shadowing as a survival act instead of confrontation.
But most modern animals, such as deer, zebras, or amphibians, are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
"The intense hunting of a hugely large and heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous it may have been to be predators from the Cretaceous dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell dead in the river, thus reaching the stream into the sea, where he sank in front of his back on the ocean floor.
At that time Albertas was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to reach much farther inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved, armored skin, while it remains three-dimensional, retaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous.
To reconstruct it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's enough just to scream at the eyes and it seems like he's sleeping."
The crisis era was a time when on Earth huge two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs – the teropods – swam.
Although their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealope, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of his terrifying predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) tall and weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he mined a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armor dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and is complete from cone to hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20 inches long squirrels came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this swamp-covered herbivore wandered through present-day Western Canada until the flooded river sank into its open sea.
But the subsea burial site of the dinosaur helped to preserve its scales in great detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the skulls of the mygaric armour plate along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “Such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stoned skin remains still cover the mygaric scales on the skull of the animal.
His right foreleg rests next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his plate."
How did an activist find the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on the bed in a rented room through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He ended up in a post from his former schoolmate.
It read: “The police just killed an 18-year-old young man and he still lies on the street.”
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The <0x40>TheePharoah user’s posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later in the evening he saw another tweet announcing a gathering of people this time on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of a police tape and screaming people, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a note saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream of police officers standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In the second video, another policeman, he said, grabbed a gun and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought: “It’s unusual.”
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical."
At that point, I was scared.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary “Whose Streets?” that premiered in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the answers in the demand of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a flowery dress and wearing a crown suitable for it, were on their way to Ferguson, they talked again about the experiences and living conditions of black people, which they had discussed many times before this morning.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?” he recalls asking himself.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
“What’s happening now is the culmination of what’s happening in the past.
He must know it and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not experience personally defiant racism, he is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would do him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world.”
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the South Florissant road — a place across the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news of police officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to protestors.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minority Nursing Students’ Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no organizational experience.
It all just got better.”
Weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, co-director of a film.
Folayan said that he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?”
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often white - come to the community and try to reap the benefits of its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for his activism in connection with the death-condemned prisoners.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were followed for years by the crew of the film "Whose Streets?" after Brown's shooting.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m portrayed.”
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that movement was not "a savior's guide, but a gathering of the community", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Whose Streets?” documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw a finished linseed.
“But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
What’s more, Ferrell’s story highlights and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who came up with the theme #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media in 2012, are homosexual.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have kept the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women.”
At the same time, he argues that "there is no such thing as creating equal opportunities" - Ferrell was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
“He was a person who was really excited about the right energy,” he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because living as a black homosexual woman at such node points is at stake.
His energy can be felt through the screen.”
At the same time, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply as a "hugebohu".
However, he still considers the mantra to be important, which he has been corroding in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 Tips on How to Get Over the Hill After a Weekend Party
Some of the more powerful male sons will find, after a nappy party, that what's wrong, will help.
Or, as the saying goes, “get drunk, stay drunk.”
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent plot for health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow, and to get through the bumps as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even in place of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
Minerals are also washed out of the body with water and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after sunbathing, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly agitated.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not be worth going to Grandma's house to break the trees - it could be a fatal lie.
But a light walk helps the body to remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Laying down in the tent and laying out the pile is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you’ve already been through drinking yesterday, don’t try to charge your stomach with a big fat fry.
For example, start with a fresh juice that contains fruit sugars that quietly swell your body.
If your health is already suffering at lunchtime, you might want to try a broth for example.
And a little later, back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic releases your body from the last water.
As I said before, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent lumps in the evening, your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose performance.
This way you will ruin your liver even more, and in the future the bumps will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for long anyway.
When you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it on an empty stomach - it irritates your already smitten stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, you can get along well with yourself.
It works the same way as walking, but you can’t orgasm while walking.
However, avoid too active a tempo and crazy poses - during the hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk stupidly to your friends and contributors, make simple stupidities, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others.
Laughing and laughing may not make you feel good, but they will certainly make it more fun to endure the aftereffects.
One day we'll get over it anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee arrested for murder
Police say they are looking for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who has become suspects after finding the body of a man with fatal stab wounds in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren accused of first-degree murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police received a phone call and found a victim on arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building with several puncture holes on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators consider stabbing as murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Public Relations Vice President Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-book statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
“This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior professor at the University of Oxford’s financial department.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-book statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to release himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's Communication Department, urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are staying, but we are increasingly working on defining the exact location,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police, this was a powerful sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: “The police are currently working on finding out the chronology of events and the background of the victim, and are exploring various motives, including the possibility that it was a family mole.”

Amy Forrett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were not profitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system simply wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on outsiders to help.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies figure out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software that has a clear goal of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City’s Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Ermett, in the three years he’s been using Glint, he’s got a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a company heat card that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay up to date with their work culture, so as not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a distressing environment that punished those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than $118,7 billion by 2020 according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a startup based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw interest and activity growth in the background of Uber’s suspicious reputation this year.
Convertcent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send custom pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging link that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
“Public opinion has been seized by regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, dismissals and lawsuits, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a frustrating and uncomfortable process, said general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, there are potential problems, such as discrimination, harassment, or dishonest wage practices, which did not reach leaders who were operating in offices in other cities or states sooner to identify and deal with them.
“I can get closer to the 360-degree holistic experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, that is, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when “social media became mature,” the companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their black laundry from publicly washing online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to have the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convertent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million, raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
In November, Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high salaries and interesting projects with only the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the General Benefit and Employee Experience Department at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
While third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they find support.
Data on employee involvement is important, according to working culture experts.
However, this data is useless if the company’s supervisors do not do anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will come.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, this can cause frustration and reduce employee involvement.
“When you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business administration company that has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“For if things don’t end, the employees will think, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Ermett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed employees in the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, on the other hand, collects new data on employees, and it is hoped that in the long run this will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees to an industry known for its high labour flow.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.”
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes with reference to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt, fast-growing institutions and business- and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where the real GDP per capita purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank said in a statement.
Although the goal is that the total output of the economy per capita is equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of the respondents who thought about their economies.
NCAA decision to cancel twice daily workouts makes Bruins days long
It’s almost 23 o’clock when the UCLA team of footballers stops to chat at the edge of a new exercise field on the team’s campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirt, revealing their sweaty back from the efforts of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these powerhouses offer a midday break.
After a three-hour training session, players go back to the dorm to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman football centre at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
“The next three days will be a real challenge for them,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day’s training sessions to reduce players’ workload has actually made their days longer – at least until the final exams reach one-half on Friday.
For this reason, the first three UCLA training sessions were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout – the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in the six Westwood seasons of Mora, training sessions take place during summer courses.
They are scheduled for 18 training sessions until August 20, before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M will begin in September.
Mora said he is in favour of a change in the NCAA’s rules, although it adds another item to the players’ tight schedules.
“They have a huge load on three or four days and that’s a serious challenge,” Mora said.
“And they shall break themselves through this tribulation; they shall strive, they shall be fine young men.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
When the camp is over, the UCLA trainings will be closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have passed the gatepost from the surrounding defense network.
Starting this weekend, the Bruins players occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems could arise with free rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use a security team in there and in the 8th parking lot.
We do our best to use what we have.
I'm trying not to worry much about that.
We have a plan in place.”
For revenge, the Savisaar-Ivanova Electoral Union born in the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland expelled from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste forced to leave the EKRE, created in connection with the unification of the forces of Our Tallinn and the party members, the Creative Businessmen Electoral Union Tegus Tallinn - it seems that the Electoral Union created on the initiative of the party policy will participate at least as much in the local elections this year's.
However, chicks are considered to be in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
When the support group of Edgar Savisaar has become smaller, it can be seen from events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current middle-party politicians and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaar avoid applying in Tallinn is that the “Savisaari List” of the perpetrators, led by corrupt people and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government for a Russian-language pop song featuring the older of Lasnamäe district; and in every sense an original computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister J<0xC3><0xBC>ri Ratas, must avoid the wallets and squirrels on the bike - is this how the Centre Party for the first time seeks the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to join the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing what other political parties have to say about the young election campaign.
If Kanal 2 or TV3 views a black screen instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen in the free-to-air show, or to hand over the tenth of the month to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who enjoy advertising-free TV experiences in public at first, but in the end - even though reluctantly - pay for television images and advertisements.
The noisy music, noisy people and trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be part of the party yourself, it’s worth exploring your home instead of having a headache – and leaving a sleeping place for a lot of money to the festival guests.
Washington Changes the Rules of the Green Card
President Donald Trump is quoted as saying he plans a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money because it changes the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Siberian Seto youths move into the city, pensioners return to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the former Manana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a gold medalist driver on the side of the extra river Kuwai on the edge of the Maana River.
This is a tough job: two months in a row without rest days for 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
Within three years of working at the Artell, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
“There’s a tough time: when you go in, you check thoroughly to make sure you don’t bring wine, and when you go out, you don’t bring gold,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho is talking to a local Seto Jan in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian Setos will also affect home setos, as it is simply so fabulous, believes Piho Mare, who studied distant Setos in the most thorough way.
His first expedition to Siberia will be 30 years later this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and has lived there for a year.
How many settlers still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it based on the Siberian Seto men's stories, who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say precisely, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of the territory here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be taught and managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came to areas not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (pale rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peters, many Setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (then the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marrying each other and polygamy.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much of the Siberian Seto culture was different and different from that of the Motherland Seto?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They also made their own (national) ideas, but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong influence on the traditional clothing of Setos, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.

The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong, which was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to it, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to the day of the Kingdom of Seto in the beginning of July and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
“It’s very easy to come and go to Tapa, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and pizza is available at every corner.
The way is top-notch city!
There is a small island on the White River, which runs through the city, where the slaughterers tend to have a Christmas party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," Reigo says.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river and just make romance - you can look at the river flow and think of life ahead and behind.
I also went there with my girlfriends.
Tamm, an opera soloist, has been on the riverbank between three bridges to practice his arias: “Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one may be able to resist when his stories are heard.”
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from the hill, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in the winter and play disc golf right now - the golf course is done, the discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo says.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
I think my colleague Rasmus Kull will be invited to visit Tapa because he is an experienced disc golfer and has disks.
Maybe he'll lend me a loan!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during the ski hours.
There's a lot of tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you can do it in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sledges and skis.
“The entire city centre is currently full of construction work, all this is going to become unknown,” Reigo says.
However, the old and tired hall building of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer performances are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the head of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and had to make a summer theatre in the hall with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season with Aleksei Karenin was just over, on August 11th, the railway station “Elluvärkamine” will have a tour of the old hall building in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the City of Tapa is the day of the day, during which, after waking up, the open home cafés and numerous cultural events, including folk rally, take place," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
In a small yellow building on the 1st of May, the museum has been in existence since 1994.
“The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information,” Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and military.
Reigo says that if Tapa goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” she says.
Trained and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company all around.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegal camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but now an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies are taught by wolves to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have to give “educational material” from their flock to the wolves again after a year’s pause – probably the wolves that taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, Hiiu Leht writes.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier, 124.
In addition, the environmental agency reports that last year the Hiiumaa wolf nests were not born, and the Hiiumaa hunting council reports that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured the other, who had to be killed.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
The amendment to the Act waives the creation of a separate database for both the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops and the handlers, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the GM crop manager’s obligation to have a prior agreement with a beekeeper within the prescribed range is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until the decision to declare Estonia GMO-free has been made," said Sigmar Suu, head of the Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, take into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors," he added.
The Bill repeals the provisions related to the location of GM crops in the GMOVS and the dataset of handlers and the training of handling, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, the GM crop grower’s current obligation to inform beekeepers of the commencement of GM crop cultivation is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeeper prior to the commencement of cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to the ministries for approval.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the information system of the drafts and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs if they wish.
The planned changes will affect, in particular, persons active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
Until now, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European seaweed for which maize MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line have also been bred in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the results of the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no deliberate cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu as a genius after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player bought over <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea started in the last pre-season game in Dublin United before winning 2-1 against Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup on Tuesday, impressing in the defensive, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensives.
However, leaving behind the Blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticu was left with a very short match and lasted only 45 minutes. Mourinho said that this must be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mood," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also began their initial lineup at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly setting up his new start-up man by the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a “great job” by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another marshmallow got a GSM transmitter on his leg on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to birdwatcher Mati Martinson, who lives in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, the first son of a bitch became a S<0xC3><0xB5>rves equipped with a transmitter, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nesting area and joined a large collection of overnight stays in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because S<0xC3><0xB5>rves is not a field of grain, says the Voice of the Isles.
On this Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cucumbers, another son of a bitch got to the sender, and that was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a nephew named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves T<0xC3><0xBC>rjul.
"His actions are on the Internet for everyone to watch: how he went to winter in Spain, when he returned for a long time to the German-Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had to install a microchip in his body to get into a house and car with a hand gesture.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, get into the office and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and his index finger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant and anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hospital in Hampshire, Winchester, in order to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northami company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, asking for <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
This father of a married child has now installed the technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hands are on the steering wheel.
White House Exhibit Costs Thousands to Taxpayers
According to military documents published in TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an American production event in the south yard to pay taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President’s presence on board, was the central attraction of the American Building Programmes event that took place at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House renewed industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the helicopter operation squadron Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military cabinet demanded the presence of a helicopter with a partial order, or FARGO, about 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern yard for an "unusual" event.
“I wanted you to be aware of this because it’s an unusually high-profile event,” the commander of HMX-1 said in an email to his boss, the deputy chief of the Navy’s leading officer in the field of aviation, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard at 7 p.m. on July 17th and remain there until the yard was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same night.
Added was the fact that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second etiquette would be required for the return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to TIME magazine whether the second edition was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether a given event could violate this provision.
“We asked if it violates Hatch’s law and we were told not to violate it,” the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy chief officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in line.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photo session is unusual.
Trump caught attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, saw the president’s plane crashing into the background, and his Twitter account crawled with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president’s plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the display of “made in America” with products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers from American materials,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 teams often test flights around Washington and outside the South to practice putting down the President of the United States to the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 held 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was counted as the standard for that month's flight instruction.
The Eskadar helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits at this event burdened the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the exhibition in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not retain the budget documents of the President's flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the 2017 annual hourly rates of the Ministry of Defence, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The documents of the squadron indicated the length of the flight from its main base at Quantico Naval Airport, Virginia, in both directions, for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below its amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irrevocable costs taken into account for the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract related costs.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the time.
“The point is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the South, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky’s representatives to joke about the company’s products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Shadeiko was hit in the last area, with a foot ramp of 800 m running, and a ladder was taken from the stadium with a bearing frame.
Shortly before that, he had reached zero in a distance jump in a Chinese-held universe.
The 2012 Helsinki European Championship broke the injury, but at the London debut Olympics it won the 23rd place with 6013 points.
However, the failure continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonians had a long-distance jump in the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he won the 15th place in the Beijing World Cup and was in the Olympic standard, but this was more of a disappointment to the athlete.
Shadeiko passed through the heaviest kadalippu only last year when he didn’t get the results from the Amsterdam EM in the distance jump.
I would just like to put together a proper multi-competition once.
One time," Shadeiko confessed.
The worst was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was broken by the first hurdle due to a femoral injury.
Time to take off – do you want to continue with the seven races at all?
Is two days of effort worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and think about it.
“I knew I wouldn’t put the pills in my bag yet,” Shadeiko says about her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page clean and move on.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of a caregiver, but she realized that the athlete must first of all come to terms with himself.
He was so devastated by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“Grit said he didn’t give up and wanted to prove to himself what he was worth,” says Mägi.
There's some kind of peace in him now.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Shadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the G<0xC3><0xB6>tzise multi-competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark in the bullet-stop by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a near- record time barrier race.
Then a multi-competitor felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but that the first competition was eliminated.
For years he has been guided by the Mägi saying that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a good athlete, he's good at training.
If something is wrong or wrong, he will say it right away.
She knows her body and trusts her body.
That's where we have to go.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Shadeiko.
“I’m not the one who gets the most out of training,” he says, saying that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Your baby’s happiness makes you happy.
Good emotions have also given Shadeiko the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and his sister Grete have recently become parents, and a multi-athlete has received support from new world citizens.
"It was very interesting," Shadeiko said.
One alcohol whose drinking equals “training” of the brain.
According to Livestrong, Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By smelling the glass, spinning the wine in your mouth, enjoying it and feeling the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain “sees” colors.
“The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the taste of the wine,” says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, says that wine is not to be drunk.
“There must be more in action,” he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system is over-saturated.
Drinking too much wine can do harm to the brain rather than benefit the brain – according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, with memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay from colleagues
Data from the company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay than colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, according to the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the payroll survey of the Fontes ICT sector.
In total, 8,577 posts were surveyed.
63% of the jobs were worked by men.
"While only 3 companies reported that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the basic monthly wage for men is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total annual salary for men is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Ilmar Pohjala, an analyst at Fontese.
Narcose Season 3 ad clip: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cali cartel will be at the heart of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the discovery of Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season of "Narcose", the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them is already a promotional clip that teases the series with new evils.
In the third season, the DEA will pay attention to the world’s richest drug-dealing organization – the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, “like Fortune 500 companies,” simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) in its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) controls ties with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascal returns to see Javier Penana, a character who recruits America and Colombia for legal aid in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be open on September 1.
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are running for the local Soviet elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“It is not possible to overstate the importance of women’s role,” he said in a statement.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on April 5.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s election marks the first time that power is peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more exciting for both the big and the small.
There is always too little time together, but training with pups provides a good opportunity to combine being together, playing, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you go in the summer, you will always have live hantlikes with you, and they will remind you impatiently with their fine voice: "Let's do some training now too!"
Start with a warm-up - very good is the usual bowling game or hanging along the beach bar.
The cake is the basis for staying in the form of legs and buttocks - who would like to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
Wonders are to use children instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight increases gradually at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
Even those who have grown up are able to cook with very young children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions and feels the possibility of fun to bend high and be important.
At the same time, older children can make their own beds.
The range of motion sets the place by touching the earth and stretching out the hands.
Hold your fingers straight, ask the mini-missile to hold them properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a very useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it’s easy to make it more fun!
Game plank: take a long column of planks, from which to wrap it through.
In fact, it is harder than usual, but much more fun to do if you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add a load, you can stay in the plank, on a little fur, and in this position you can also walk around.
For additional difficulty, you can put a small child on the hips, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs sift in the sand, triceps, buttocks and abdominal muscles get loads like a nascent.
The child descends to the legs so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and back.
You can hold your hands for safety.
Bend your legs and straighten straight up.
You can fly, have fun, balance, and be difficult.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he gets up.
Additional burden is provided by the stretching of the legs.
Make sure your back stays in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun doing their abdominal muscles in pairs and clapping.
Handwork and a pulsed squat.
Monitor the child’s safety, the position of the knee, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For parents, however, it is really effective throughout the body workout.
Sports equipment was Ott (10), Säde (8), Happiness (4).
A journey from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Braided bags from straws are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which one of the right summer fans has to hang on his hand and which, despite its modest origin, merchants have been able to weld a price tag for the hit.
A bag braided from the shoulders is probably one of those things that has always existed in life, and the possession of which has not given rise to any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, nothing's broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and the fashion fans have exchanged their fine designer bags for simple shoulder-padded bags for the summer months.
It’s not just a beach bag, but it’s just as popular as a street bag today, and even the bravest women walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth making it clear whether a summer look like this for the boss is still sitting, or it is still worth putting a wetsuit and a laptop in a slightly more formal Sumadan.
However, the variety of shoulder bags has made women’s true summer love.
When reading foreign fashion blogs, for example, the first thing to keep in mind is that fashion gourmands bring the first thing to the local market on a holiday and buy themselves a pair of shoulder bags, for which they will be loyal throughout the holiday season, and which goes along with the beach, the market and also with friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand-in-hand to each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, such madness is understandable, because few are those times when in the fashion world it is possible to buy a thing that has fallen into disrepute for just a few tens of euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple money-making opportunity here, and so finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably still so that richer customers don’t feel like simple-minded people who go around with low-cost bags.
For example, you can buy a straw bag from Dolce & Gabbana that costs over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag may be worth 6000 euros per round.
Unlike most fashion shops, straw bags do not come from some of the big fashion shops, but their story started from a distance.
It is said that straw bags originate far from the Philippines, from which they have spread.
The braiding of a bag of straws is primarily an expo, and the locals are very often not seen walking around with them.
It is said that the brewing technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite sarane with ordinary baskets.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as strongly braided as the basket, patterns and other materials can be woven into it, making the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with braided coloured ribbons or leather bands.
The letter of thanks can be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the biggest braided pair of straw bags had never been seen before.
He matched his shoulder bag with all sorts of clothing kits and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
With the popularity of bags nowadays, it is not less important, but also that caring for them is a dove head, and unlike all other Sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towel.
As always with the trend busts, after the classic look, brands have come out with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a braided shoulder or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on the shoulder.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag made of straws has been considered classic, which resembles a basket of its own style, is open from the top and has short, as well as straws, handles.

Then the battery on his phone became empty and the location of the man could no longer be determined.

GMB worried about investment in McVitie’s Glasgow factory
The company expects the leaders of the cookie maker McVitie’s to confirm long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the Tollcross site investment.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the last few years.
There, employees and union leaders were hired to "be the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company’s site manager, GMB Scotland addressed the company’s McVitie’s request to “resolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines.”
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get a clear understanding of Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan from the head of the site makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families working here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, an indispensable pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, there is a pressing need for a rapidly growing productivity company in McVitie."
Pladis’s representative said: “Tollcross’s object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place between Tollcross employees and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross site, most of it has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production object, and if there is any change in the activity of the object, the employees and the representatives of the trade union will be the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about its approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in an effort to lure Neymar into its ranks, making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3> 189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest?
This clumsy approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of over-buying, set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry at both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalans’ board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the world of football about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif sternly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we’ll take action against them and contact those players,” said Al-Khelaif.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the central player of PSG Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could, as a result of this interest, be set back by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
“Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he said.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it is not possible to do so, to remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain’s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have such a deal with Britain."
The alternative would be to return to customs posts that would proclaim historical divisions and political failure.
"Failure to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit “a challenge for our generation” and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during his visit to Belfast.
Märt Avanti, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in Otepää, the winter capital, while the semi-long Ironman competition was held in about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was also won by Märt Avanti.
"I thought it would turn out to be complicated and eventually it was complicated," Avandi said in the final.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that in fact triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
"Not the distance kills, but the pace kills," he said, implying that at an effective pace, almost everyone reaches the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: “Ott’s physical is fine, but he can’t swim.”
Avandi had been working hard since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
With time 05:34:12 he reached 270th overall.
While Avandi lost to both Raio Pirioja (time 04:59:53) and J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominist class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person" last year, lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The general winner of the men’s records of the Otepää stage in Ironman’s series was the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with 04:24:01, while the Estonians defeated Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour, and got to 04:58:58.
The Avant passed a 1.9 km long swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
