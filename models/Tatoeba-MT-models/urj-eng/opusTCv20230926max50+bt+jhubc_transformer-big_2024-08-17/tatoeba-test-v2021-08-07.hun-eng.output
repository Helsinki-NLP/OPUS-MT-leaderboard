I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
It's better with your sister.
It goes with the love I have for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.

It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
She's clearly freaked out.
It didn't break.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
It's cold to let you come.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn’t matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the previous day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
This is exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, dear.
There had to be a reason for this.
Suddenly it happened.
This happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.

I think I'm dying.
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

I think I need more time.
It's like I've seen a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
Your chances are very low, I think you'll be able to do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.

I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.

I think you're the only one who needs help.

I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.

I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It had a huge impact on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical drama.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
She's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
Basically, it's your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to be prepared for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
That's not the right solution.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's no secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not good to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today!
That's so expensive!
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
This is useful information.
There's a lot of heat at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after replacing your baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
He'll be ready when it's time.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It will take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be knocked down soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you were thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried it.
Maybe I'll be late.
It needs to be washed.
He has to report something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
We need to fix it.
It never existed.

I've arranged it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.

It fell yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust my life.
I'm constantly trying to find out.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
It's a big-ass cat.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.

It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark outside.

It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's already ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams has always been living next to a brook.
It's always the same song.
Environmental disaster.
It's a lousy business, Watson, a lousy, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame!
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a big, big stick.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
This is as much art as science.
It's the past.

It's a waste of money.
It's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
This day is exhausting.
Today is a tough day.
This has happened before.

That's very delicious!
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.

Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
He seems to be lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work out for me.
It seems to me that you are honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's getting ugly.
It's getting weird.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a shooting star.
It's good to be warm.
It's good to learn.

This is impossible for me.
You need to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
Inability to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
This is inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just move on.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a subterranean field, and the turtles, rays, and sharks over it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
It's my turn now.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as loud as it sounds.

That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negociable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.

It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.

It doesn't matter if some people think they're peasants.
It's okay to be gay.
“It’s been three months, and Tomi says he’s fluently speaking French.” “Yes, he’s at the top of the stupid gene.” “What peak?” – Dunning-Kruger effect.
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring it out of the dough.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mizantropic theories is manifested in the defamation of the working class, absolved of imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it provoked, and in the belief that the innate aggressive tendencies of man are the root cause of endless wars.
It's very urgent.
It rains in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's right there.
It's unscrupulous to ask someone how much they earn.
They say the Czech girls are pretty.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I have read so far.
That's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time we picked up our tent tree.
Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut by now.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.

It's a shitty cold.
It's ugly, it's rich yellow and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't run away in the dark!
It's under the table.

It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy for me to keep my promise.
It was an underarm on the belt.

This will grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.

This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to get out of here.
It would be meaningless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
