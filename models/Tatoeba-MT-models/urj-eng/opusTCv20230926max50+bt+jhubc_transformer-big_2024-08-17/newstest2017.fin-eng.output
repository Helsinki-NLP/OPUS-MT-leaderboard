28-year-old chef found dead in shopping center in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead on the sidewalk of a local shopping center this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he doesn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, “His case finally went well.”
The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galician, the San Francisco Death Investigation Bureau said.
San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined as a homicide and that the investigation was ongoing.
Victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a bus stop chef in Boston, had got his dream job as a bus chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “disappointed and shocked” by his death.
“We have a small team that acts like a close family and will be greatly missed,” he said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the hostel for the first time, but that recently “his business finally went well.”
“He found an apartment and dated a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, to make dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shined brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone who has any information on the matter will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new work-fighting measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to adopt new labour-fighting measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the Council as a whole to support new labour-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “insistently quiet” about the issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for a progressive and expanding combat programme starting early in September.
The dispute has resulted in medical trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA’s medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
Ele, which ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met to hold hands and declare the eight-month-long battle of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got a clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, the event was held.
But Putin’s smile looked violent, and he didn’t even dare to boast of the warmth, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, was constantly talking about his "loving friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I got mixed up in the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But Putin’s radiating coolness showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led to an astonishing, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the Isis-dominated areas of Syria.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown in a failed coup last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are once again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, the West is angry at what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
By adding a long-standing grudge to it from the speed of the negotiations on EU membership, Putin will come forward, eager to take advantage of the coolness and break Turkey's ties with the Western countries.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to receive loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is the case for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the prame seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce the “foreign alliance”, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel the West abandoned them and mistreated them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have major disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It can be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus as to where they can look for a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are again even speaking in the air.
Royal Bank of Scotland is missing from customers outside of Scotland
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
At this time, bank strategists have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of weights used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of the head office and stock exchange listings, are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we will now become a much more brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global targets, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in their communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win
Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second win at home, competing with John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional, because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It’s not a big event, it’s not Royal Ascot, it’s an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The Dettori absorbs the cheers as he pulls out the Predilection after the victory.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in the hurdles – master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that she has reached this milestone, which few have reached before her.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical ace sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode with 6,000 winners if he weren't just the jockey of the weekend and big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a brand-name drone landing from the saddle.
From flight stopovers to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British racing race for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He won a lot of wins in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and suffered a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he had difficulty getting started when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed considerable character strength when challenging the doubters and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin resigns Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin had "determinated Ivanov to move away from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov’s deputy director, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the president’s protocol and board of directors, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Vaino be appointed to replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting on state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle after all?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me four years’ responsibility for this very complex task, perhaps even to say the hard one.
Now I have been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the state security service FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets a shoe after hitting a producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the filming site in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson’s character is removed from the FBI agent team series are expected later.
The 54-year-old who starred in Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it everything I can over the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28th.
Mysterious fish end up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published film material about the manifestation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry’s crossing and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four feathers between the "coverbones" that are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 branches.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit site.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used alone to build this bridge section.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which the extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the concrete deck of the last part of the deck is laid today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last section of the road cover was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road cover, we then had to close the remaining section on the north side, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by pulling 700 mm southwards of the North Passage Bridge.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge, because the bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Demanding, because the allowed deviations that the team worked according to were tiny, only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "happy to be alive" after falling off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfold in the Moelfre Bay bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat orbiting closer to the men and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the ship's captain.
“Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got there,” he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men who have been caught in water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a knock-off rope in the boat engine, but it had somehow detached the boat from the person who was driving when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable pursuit of health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time looking at screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some activity.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity don’t exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go app, which is based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they produced a series of cartoons, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and can then be “photographed” (by phone screen capture) or “picked” after finding them.
The generation that played the game younger has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch to join the quests.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% on users who followed Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level information.
Many public health campaigns’ calls to “find 30,” “get off the couch” and “be active every day” have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and are passed on to people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disdainful ridiculers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk through the door.
And then what?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were apps like Fitbit in the past that could track activity, they didn’t give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and the use will be reduced in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, better fit and healthier.

Simone Biles grabs gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth with boom.
Incredibly permanent.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the championship in a row, and the fifth American champion overall. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement elevates him to the same category as other of the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overcrowded expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
U.S. Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the women's standings multi-stakeholder final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Elok.
Biles scored the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the culmination of the opening ceremony of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he went to the top of long knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes the voltification of his trademark, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit perfectly in the street next to Rio’s Olympic arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother, while she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powerhouse.
He has not lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, in which Biles is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top with the boom points of 15,433 and crossed them by getting 15,933 permannas.
Raisman hugged her with goodwill as they waited for the final points—just formality—and tears rose up in the glitter red, white, and blue eyes of Biles, when the dream he once wrote about in his clip book came true.
Raisman's performance was a sort of revancer from four years ago, when he was in third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in a rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in charge.
He sent flying kisses to the public after his permanto performance from an emotional retreat that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot while listening to music in the car
In the deadliest attack on Phoenix’s first serial killer in the last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
According to the press release, a gunman standing on the passenger’s side fired up to eight times and then escaped by another vehicle.
Police say the triple death did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or $2,900 from another adult victim.
Officer Jonathan Howard, a Phoenix police officer, said the shooting led investigators to see if it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over a four-month period in two predominantly Latin American neighborhoods.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple death, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found bullet shells, bullet seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: “The situation is getting easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of her peers, Edmund is small-headed, which is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do that.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walkie-talkie.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund's inventive signs "sing to me."
“We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own sign language.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, such as Edmund's case, or pregnancy viral infections such as the measles vaccine or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What will happen?
And he doesn't really know yet.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a while, because I don’t expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe that things will get easier.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
The heavy rains and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded over their midwives and caused a widespread flood threat due to extremely severe rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they would receive requests for high tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tangipahoa County asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five cents of rain is expected in the region.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in force on Friday, when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
Both the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a risk of flooding the lower Ascension district along the river, as the flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking up people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, along with his wife and step-son, were on Friday near Gloster among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that Beaver Creek water, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another boy living near him warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had not seen a stream of water so high during the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only one with swimming skills.
Hansford said the rescue workers saved the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely saturated by heavy rains since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a member of the City Council said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been stranded in the high tide.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
“They can go back to their homes when the water starts to drop,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, about twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood here was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s managing authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that even rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that a handful of houses were reported flooding on Thursday, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, Director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
"Full of bullets" six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child’s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Majhaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to, among other things, the groin, leg, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One in 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
The researchers told CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
Attack-type shells, which come from different types of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant struggle.
There were shells on both sides of the pavement.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating the surveillance tapes.
The other six-year-old girl got hit by a stray on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That’s why I’m calling this year’s Women’s Olympic Gymnastics Team for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team, at last, looks like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised him as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win individual gold in a women's polygamy.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gyms around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five) because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually practice in private gymnast clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competitive fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gym clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnast foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people (mainly blacks and Latins) and we have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic sport.
The gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, as well as for school and work success.
This team’s inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young femininity.
Medical Practitioners Set Up New Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 medical trainees who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on “unknown soil” and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to the night and weekend work habits to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Practitioners Committee, said in a statement last night: “Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally.”
When only eight weeks are left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met by the government’s unwillingness to participate and from time to time by deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners will be ready to continue their work-fighting efforts.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a delay of almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as substitutes for doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 medical trainees under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on medical practitioners not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause anxiety, anxiety, and disruption to patients, caregivers, and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from Sabbath leave, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - will be a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England Training Organisation and the Ministry of Health in November, February and May with respect for BMA agreements.
A medicine that costs two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are taking advantage of two pounds a day of the drug, after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
Anticoagulation medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
The NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people get a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of them get a second seizure or stroke.
Cardiac attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fat in the artery wall that forms a stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the circulation of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can pass through the blood and cut off the circulation to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft NICE guideline recommends that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg twice a day when taken with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective prevention treatments, up to a quarter of people with a heart attack will later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective at reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the draft guidelines.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving an impetus to the government’s report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles ordered police, election guards and city councils to ignore evidence of electoral fraud because of “race and religion-related hypersensitivity.”
The former Community Secretary, the current Emperor of Anti-Corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set guard chains to protect those who are afraid of voting places.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when they vote to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voting person be put on an indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Witnesses should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He called on the press to have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by informal committees or by a working group.
“This would not only protect the electoral fraud, it would protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the electoral fraud,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the voting scandal in East London’s Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "suddenly distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result was that a person would vote in a different way.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the vote by post in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community said they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of communities of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“There were concerns that ... the state institutions had ignored such behavior because of the “politically correct” race and religious hypersensitivity.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for the clean-up of the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with ballots sent by post in order to end the "collection of votes".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for stricter checks on those who register in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting for an indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by post.
Prevent political activists from dealing with the voices and envelopes received through the mail, where the voices are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Request that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric runs into Greater London with the police, saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court would stay with Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions," he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the threshold of evidence in criminal law.
He also criticised inefficient "cross-checks" at city council polling offices.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the creator of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation."
Crazy Kate to bicycling and other celebrity pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who can boast of his own famous double being – at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes that clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the US men's archery team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate’s twin being on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since the surface of his photos, in which he appears to be frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the excitement of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard from childhood that he looked like Leo.
“I don’t see much resemblance, except perhaps for a beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will certainly emerge this year as well: a startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina’s biggest, expressive eyes have been said to be the double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger change of eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more to do with actress Annalynne McCord than with tanned skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of “the sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between a couple
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site, saying, “Others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar form of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC’s Olympic commentator apologizes after saying a Chinese swimmer “dead like a pig”
Byron MacDonald's analysis of a 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4x200-meter freestyle message angered viewers of CBC's direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC must have apologized after one of its reporters said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer “lost like a bad smell” and “dead like a pig.”
The narrator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s reporting team to bring the “color,” was heard saying, “That little 14-year-old from China got mad, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second part of the message at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers all over Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC narrator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’????
The idiot didn’t realize he was still on live broadcast.”
China’s Ai Yanhani was described in the women’s freestyle 4 x 200 m relay final as follows: “That little 14-year-old from China muttered, baby.”
A review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn’t arrest themselves when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald’s comment on the live broadcast, saying: “We apologize for the fact that the comment on the swimming performance was sent.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr. Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The TV company quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in a statement.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
“It’s almost unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark’s customer is dismayed by a woman who arrogantly adapted lingerie in the middle of a trade
Customers didn’t know where to look when she took off in the middle of Primark’s movement to try out underwear.
The thing was not healed by the fact that after evaluating what she looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to spin and eventually settled four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where she arranged underwear and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after trying lingerie, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underpants on display, undressed her own stockings and underwear, and put on her fitable legs.
“He didn’t even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there in disgrace.”
“Everybody stared when he took off his underwear and obviously didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.”
He did the same for three more before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear that he would fit."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is fine.”
"It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has dressed them up and stripped them off and not washed them."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
How to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the Krav Maga Federation’s Grand Master, Rhon Mizrach, in New York City, to find out how to deal with gun-spinning looters in the vicinity.
Whether you’re in front or behind, this video shows you how to pay an attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and "scratch the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between your elbow and your shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the knee on the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, turn the gun from his hands, hit him with the gun on his face and back, holding the gun pointing at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the fireline, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to trigger.
At the same time put the weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point at him with the gun.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveller has put a serious challenge on his immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and nightliest places.
Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, licked euro banknotes, a rail in Piccadilly Circus, a washing button in the train’s toilet, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment, which was made in the wake of a film called Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the rinsing button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a tester of the endurance of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, extending from public rail rail railings to the flush button of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said: “Since childhood, I have been rather carefree about my health, and have put in my mouth all sorts of things from the soil, the worms, and the scurvy water.”
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his sample, the photometer contained more than 4,000 units of reading.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveler’s film, Internal Force, together with Finnish dairy Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's night-time here.
The inner power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered to Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of the Valio snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the probiotics’ interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian.'"
They argue that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film is an interesting way for us to tell consumers more about it.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: “Let’s just say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the night-gown Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved."
In a 2015 poll conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
The <0xC3><0x96>kk<0xC3><0xB6>ri family destroyed a rental building in Saltash, Cornwall, before the eviction
The <0xC3><0x96>kk<0xC3><0xB6>ri family caused <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to their rental property after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained of numerous times.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the dismayed employees of the housing company found the property to be in poor condition.
There were gaping holes on the walls, floor boards were torn, waste was spread on the floor and the walls were cremated with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in a private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
Here are a lot of things to consider, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is insolent, and their name is insolent.”
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and according to the police, the family’s tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarreling, and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision in June on anti-social behaviour.
Many rooms in the house under demolition threat found old waste.
The property, from which drugs have previously been transmitted, the floorboards had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and the police called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to voluntarily change.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the ravishing wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own conduct and for the conduct of his family, for eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as the courageous community members who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding
Homeowners now need to clean up the waste piles around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales, supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been guilty of possession of class B drugs as an intention to distribute it further.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless after freezing in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had graffiti on them.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.

Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, were shocked by their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept past very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, horrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost to a contact distance from sun worshippers in a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists stood up as they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not initially see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of a dramatic pastime on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to plunge into the country.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared in the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility due to smoke from nearby off-road fires, but the Air Force assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, the fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low visibility due to adverse conditions, the smoke caused by ground fires, and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The first half of the year is better than expected.
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January-June of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of Eksote was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to reduce the number of action queues.
Exote covers the deficit that was previously incurred by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards swear by a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military election of the Border and Coast Guard School’s conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The casting ceremony of the 10th special cross-border course was held in the sports field of the garrison.
Seventy soldiers were sworn in.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were selected as special pioneers.
250 of them were invited to participate.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans’ meeting in connection with the coup was attended by five veterans of the border troops during the war.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of bandit ahead - criminal intelligence helps clear up crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has been operating an RTA, the criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is Lieutenant Lahde.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to the other police.
In Häme, among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less frequent for the police to leave the swamps only when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit of its own for each police unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Criminal Police, operates nationwide.
PTR units employ, as their name suggests, people from the Police, Customs and Border Protection Department.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas shared by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Exploration extends beyond its own territory
While a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
The investigation also extends beyond the boundaries of the institution itself, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert task database and observations to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author forms a certain picture.
Serialisation can be done either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not fully public.
Neither their own nor the methods used by criminals are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thereby trying to prevent police crime-fighting attempts.
The police will announce the methods publicly if they expect them to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, reported in early summer, the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housing burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape into the outside door of the apartment, where they tried to see if the residents were really on the move.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest ones order the district court’s minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves in hand.
For the purpose of the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the East Finland Police Department, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to help plan practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation gathers information from outside the borders of Finland and Finland.
ISIS-affiliated schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasime Akunjee said the girl’s family heard her dead in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrikes at Raqqa, an organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others, that there are real risks of going to the war zone — that it could cause people to give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family were told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland a candidate for the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senator Harry Reid said he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect Antonin Scalia to replace the late Supreme Court member.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts with “some degree of certainty” Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that this was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn’t want to “walk the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans who block Garland’s nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s “dogs” and “possibles.”
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos is different from the Playboy of the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start again introducing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these images of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Templates can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill out a comment section with irritable insults written by the not-for-allMiddle-aged Men, you will notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of the much-spoken records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the desire of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of the records to be bought are those of the 18-24 age group.
It is also not just a question of collecting amateurs, but also of emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would be babbling vigorously before stopping, forming a cup of my hands and saying something authoritative, such as, "Let's look at it in more detail."
Let's look into it more closely.
While Soho’s charm and dirt are slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and stores, as well as office stores, now fill buildings that used to have independent stores – a handful of great specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgower Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (a calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (a calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in his twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
“Yes, I am,” he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford at the time they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and moneyless.
“Most of the material I bought is from the late 60’s and early 70’s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that album buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my vice.”
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets fit into YouGov’s profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the records have come back to fashion and who have become in need of buying their old records back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have gotten rid of their collection generally in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back,” he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl currants of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be amazed by the digital world and choose to trust the persistence of familiar disk covers; objects that evoke the memories of teenage happy days.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the sheet metal.
A poll conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought vinyl in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of people who buy vinyls don’t have a turntable.
At this point, the news report would probably seem seriously concerned when I browsed the pile of bossa nova collections.
This “prize” aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, who works at Sounds of the Universe (the calculator: three middle-aged men), 42, has also noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead’s record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big deal, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So, not the parents, but the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
There is a much more diverse audience when I arrive in Fop, where there is now almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls.
Seventy-six couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than the previously mentioned moves - from the loudspeakers to the freshest scapegoat and sex-filled pop by Wild Beast, rather than improvisation jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove a gruesome psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopika for a few minutes looking at various discs on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so recording isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look like I’m studying jeans shorts, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before their father and daughter were thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with discs from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's purely "art vinyls".
But given that even a little attention from these objects can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho’s corvettes to get more, there’s not much to complain about.
It will not come as a surprise that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are true at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in a school or office.
They really don’t spend Thursday mornings wrestling around Berwick Street’s record stores, browsing records and avoiding the gruesome 30-year-old fake TV presenter watching her peek over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the furthest living vertebrate animal - video report
Researchers say that the vault has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is on a female, whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, and which is five meters long.
French court dismisses application for deportment from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, which houses thousands of refugees.
During the court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect’s Office argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent taxes on the unpaid parallel economy and because they represent a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that there are no legal grounds for evicting people who are running 72 temporary trades, but said that Calais’s prefect’s concern was “fully understandable.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than feeding only people living in “extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the demolition threat was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit camp that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure of the café would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — to a peak — after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food in Finland falls clearly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food prices are sharply reduced to the joy of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen the second most in those EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
Compared to the UK alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest figures are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed by a twist, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia, are now pressing the price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Both S Group and Kesko have lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive food in Finland in the EU, which had a similar salary level to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell third of the cheapest food from similar countries.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparable countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we must halve VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
A student returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all schools in Finland operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Somniosus microcephalus, known as Somniosus microcephalus, reaches the age of 150.
It can live after another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic bumblebee, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old.
The Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the pace of growth is slow, according to reports only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 miners trapped in fishermen's traps.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbonisation of the eye lenses.
The average age of sharks tested was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493-centimetre and 502-centimetre amazonians, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at this point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired at nearly 300 salespeople - no reduction in sales
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores is not reduced in order not to suffer from customer service.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann’s negotiations concerned some 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are to be realised in the coming year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the department store are in the background.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade continues to lose.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the goals set by the company.
“Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved the best second quarter of its turnover and earnings ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating profit of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be frosts in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north, there are 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete for the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Last year, Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup and is ahead of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was passing the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he would be exposed,” the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium is in a state of emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for athletic medals, but the world’s top individuals were able to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheering people.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, in the views of rugby, kayaking and horseback riding, thousands of empty benches have been seen.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the spectators were full.
After the Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators were full.
The bad news is, at least, that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian racer, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the organizers’ spokesman, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left for sale," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although they cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have fluctuated from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, because organizers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known sports such as golf and rugby to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty places at Rio Stadium this morning.
Even the beach volleyball with Copacaba sand has not interested the audience.
Jukka Kessalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders for money in the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of holder for a fee.
The holder is entitled to veto a block of 187 square metres, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the intended purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Obtaining a right of control is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carry banderols or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The holder of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which allows for example a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of the rights appear on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the parcel data of the land area can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the activities of the Foundation will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its activities through the sale of the rights of holders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turku - see the situation in your home country
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the worst of the big cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat determined the amount of bicycles and parts of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, police were informed of only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
That's the big difference.
“In other cities, there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” police inspector Tommi Reen describes.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
“The frequency of errors can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are at all,” said Constable Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Finnish Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where city centres are far away from each other and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little more than 20,000 bike thefts per year.
That means 50-60 gallons a day, and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
“They’re a lot of them,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report of bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be reported.
A typical solved bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“There are also cases in connection with other investigations when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug-related apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are caught on a weekly basis in connection with an act or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, inner yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually anywhere where they are normally stored.
As in previous years, the highest number of individual bike models are stolen.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the wheel for short-term own use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that stolen bikes would go abroad very much,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or offence.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a decent bike is sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries her colorful Nopsa all the time during her working day to the shelters of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five laps, but none has been stolen, says the Monster. "Never been taken, there has been a good monk."
“Perhaps this doesn’t attract thieves so much, there may not be any hipster value here,” the Helsinki-based Hirvi says.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike roped the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks its bike in a fixed, such as a bike rack.
“It’s going to be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student from Helsinki, who says about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you'll hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such sloppy-sloppy ones."
A year ago, a bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the housing company.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to be taken.
Children under 15 years of age are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki is testing peer-to-peer crews familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer crew is tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
A peer-to-peer crew is missing the first crime a young man commits.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer crew will discuss what happened to the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer-to-peer crew to make up for his or her actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Young Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used side by side.
“Everyone directs young people’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t get ruined by the first mistake,” says Laitio.
A model from the United States, in which it is widely used, has been adopted for the purposes of the peer-to-peer crew.
The idea is that young people, after their first crime, do not go to the adult panel, but reflect on what happened to people of roughly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes committed by children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
“It’s been a message to continue on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to be diverted to the congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his recklessness, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor threaten to bring a sound wave to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-embellished anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico says the letter will be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want a party to protect their majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have corrupted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president, so that the American economy can do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handhold for American duunars who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax,” Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I am opposed to all trade deals that work against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump’s Monday economic program for “just favoring millionaires like this.”
Trump’s proposal to reduce corporate taxes has been described by Clinton as “Trump’s loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s audience figures: the races have not glued Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the highest number of spectators.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population has been glued to the squares at their best: swimming on Tuesday night was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the one-month-old European Athletics Championships attracted nearly 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championship received a fair second million at a time.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports so far is the Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the race, which opened up to almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and points out that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large number of television viewers choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s feudal events will come in Finland at nighttime.
Another reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now considers it a slim one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first race, the interest would have sprung up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of spectators at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the audience numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the first days of the competition on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're about 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the numbers later on in the network,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena has had delays and other minor technical problems in its early stages.
Updated versions of the applications are available, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s canals and arenas than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe transmits races every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laboring for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
Since 2018, the Olympic sport has been visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre print in Ristisel, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonication.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters reach Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There could be unknown depths,” Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by a mean depth, it is the Great Lake of Juka, 23 meters.
In this way, your Päijänne will not reach the top ten, and Suvasvesi will be further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax evasion: Pensioners’ taxation is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage-earners.
Ihalainen says that the issue was raised during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be respected after the election, he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated by opposition representatives in the Parliament, who polished the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (OK.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.), the tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Orpo on their willingness to respect the competitiveness agreement reached with great effort.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government term.
It has been done with the help of labour market organisations, so it should not be called into question.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own confidence in the future.
Long-term unemployment in the run-off
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in the budget crisis.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is not taken into account, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in Thailand attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand during the time of Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions about caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently absent from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and to the referendum on the constitution of the military junta last week.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested who protested against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
She says the city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thailand Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police, according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died within 24 hours, after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today.
At least one of the two double-bomb attacks died.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than in South Thailand and in the city of Trang in both.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes them to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators was to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finns in Finland to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the superstitious, Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and their victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has made it possible to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded as a sight near a bell tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Party wins women's four-match
Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships in Rio with permanno, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics to a degree over the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permanno championships three times in a row, as well as the boom in the last and the second year.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two World Team Championship titles.
The darker World Cup medals at Biles are from jumps and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombing on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more miraculous, according to Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said it's not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach have not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o’clock in the day, traffic in Patong had normalized, and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who were suitable for identification marks hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately caught.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear setbacks
In Russia, the highest-ranking change of leadership took place on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and has served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been chained with other executives or screwed up.
Dismantling to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will be assigned special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other positions and suggested that Vaino replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear downfall.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people on the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pyn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi of the Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the successor of Ivanov's place that Putin changes his circle younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields when they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus so that we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of vehicles where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and on the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Director of Communications at the Ministry says to STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in the last few years, Bolt has run against time during the contest.
From the beginning of the season, he broke his back and was forced to skip the Jamaican Olympic qualifying.
This hasn’t been perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included underdressed samba dancers and fans turned into journalists.
Reindeer around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter early stages of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down his injury and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors, despite the end of the jubilee, in the time of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career with a watch.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second low, but no one else believes it to be born but Bolt himself.
Bolt’s biggest challenge is Athens 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost at any time in the finals, if only he has made his way.
At the 2011 World Cup final, Bolt did not run due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set the final goal for his career at the World Cup in London next year.
These are the Olympic Games that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the lowlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio Reveals Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Failure
Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, had given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoxy hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadoo, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua reports that Xiny's sample on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also been revealed in Rio.
According to the BBC, Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoxy hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre-long runner Ferguson Rotich's helmet.
Phelps can't be stopped by anything - historic gold came into play style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in 200 metres for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold medal of the same sport in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the period before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, the BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read this week on the website of Iltalehti.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if there's a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and peculiar outfits.
Television is visual media, he says.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
There are no back steps, however.
It’s important to look good, and small trials are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to be agitated and perhaps agitated, but he insists that he does not want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It’s a rush from scratch if it comes from (the runner’s) clothing.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said Thursday they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
The police also arrested five other people and interrogated two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the Islamic State.
The detainees were reportedly inciting violence on social media.
Among other things, messages calling for violence had been distributed on the popular WhatsApp service.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after the package was detonated in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police had carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the package.
The audience did not reach the scene by the start of the match, as the police shut down the arena due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only let the public in the hall after that.
The game was a dreamy start to the Spanish team.
Spain, which started two defeats, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentinian lady banged Petäjä-Siren - Finnish contemplating protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful race day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren felt hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady banged Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was stranded because of the crash, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered a long-term protest.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, the Finn left for 27th place.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The crash on the tip didn't seem to work much.
Friday is an important day when the race starts from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says will prolong your life
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him additional years.
These include, for example, a tendency to moderate body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to squeal - just getting a milk can is enough.
The secret of a long life has been explored through many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented the seven most bizarre findings.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with “a reduced risk of death,” especially in neurological or heart-related diseases.
Another study on alcohol claims that moderate use — from one to three meals a day — may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of the floss can extend a person’s life by up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can help with other diseases in other parts of the human body.
A study conducted in Norway showed how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring additional years, and there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solubility.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with large hindquarters had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over the age of 65 found that a person who shops daily was probably less likely to be a shopping parent.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunken drunk driving in front of a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car accident took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koske, in the middle of Koskenttie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived in front of it had hit the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stood up on its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, who was born in 1972, was pressed into her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 million.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Posti sent loose cannons to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s inventory of bulk sheets, as the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit his eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulkheads, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If there was no rush in the lawn, the sign read.
The dealer’s foxy sign is related to Posti’s expansion of its services to grass cutting last spring.
The grass cutting is on offer at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me abstinence.
Media representatives have been playing all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her own favorites in a bag of loose sheets, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
It was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Halti did not get angry at the sign because she found all of her own loose arch favorites in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, 30 kilos lighter, published a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has lost tens of kilograms since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos on Instagram on Friday.

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss job in 2009.
She has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has collected a number of commendable comments from co-creators.
You're gorgeous, aren't you?
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when you’re on the same journey, someone tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Do It Now project.
At the time, he told the evening newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was about 10 pounds.
During the three-month exercise period, the kilos eventually fell by five.
Loviisa Murdered Woman's Family Wish: Victim's Memories for Police Dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by a donation for police dog labour.
Sipoo Veterinarian’s office has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the wish of the victim’s family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nurse training there.
Veterinarians remember her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless at work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donations go to the police dogs in their entirety, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening newspaper that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roosters.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know a woman and had no connection.
A police dog B<0xC3><0xB6>rje was involved in the murder, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
However, the burgeoning remains alive and is recovering.
District Court sentences Posti for violation of the Equality Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to train a temporary worker, the District Court of Kanta-Häme assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the share of the orientation during the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organisational decision to ban the introduction of the Finnish Postal and Logistics Union.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported in the People's News.
Turkey's return to the road to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini tell us that Finland has repeatedly brought to the attention of Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin resigns the head of his administration - replaced by Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close inner circle, will move to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin’s statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace Vaino, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant deal to ban games - not seen at the opening of the Premier League
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban followed in England.
Manchester United’s bid for Paul Pogba is out of the game as ManU opens its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros from Pogba.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left under a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings at the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event, starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
Festival wearers have typically expressed themselves with their own unique dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is being screened with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event do the authors themselves want to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 in the last year by 5,000 people.
This year we will also see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been enhanced so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, which has been partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage stages, there will be a tent for 15,000 people this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little big crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Kallio is that even the big visions are now practically possible.
In the first years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the city of Helsinki’s support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, Flow's net sales to the limited liability company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creek things" such as the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own unique outfit.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out from the content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, he is not the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was buoyed because it is probably the last time she will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and exploded with the help of cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a conservationist of wild animals living in Asia since 1989, tweeted a photo of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran up to me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was favored by Finns.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been heavily involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will go to battle first in a wartime situation
In the case of an acute war, the armed forces are not ordered to fight until several months after the military oath was sworn in, the Central Finn says.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible to fight in the event of a war.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve members of the emergency forces are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is commanded to a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became clear that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training the conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola Receives Huge Compensation for Home House
Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court’s ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple’s trial and liquidation for a total of EUR 47,344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was somewhat because some of the need to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers at the time of the sale of the apartment.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
In the court of appeal, Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a decent home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had an idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the circumstances mentioned in the health inspection report.
The health inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the cliff.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little in a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses was due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
In the western part of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
In the brush samples, mould or yeast that makes health risk possible, exceeding the limit values, was found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window hacker and the basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to change the apartment in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there had not yet been proper permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court of appeal states in its judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
In a recent article by journalist Christopher Andersson, Dagens Nyheter writes that the National Archives of the United States of America, Maryland, has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German breed agency.
The breed agency was under the leadership of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
Women’s background was studied by the Finnish National Agency, for example, through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "sustainable", and "good National Socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were prohibited by law, the museum’s website states.
Petäjä-Siren's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first round of Finnjollie’s day at the Rio Olympics, but remained at the top of the team’s tail in the second round of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for the RS:X class day starting at positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470th grade, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so stuck”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dance stages and festivals, continues to grow from the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, and is currently in a state of extreme stress.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and evil.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total height when he won the crown of the tango king at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen in a slightly different form.
The song "Satulinna" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book states that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stuck!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that had become a huge hit would not immediately be thought to have been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I’ve learned that you don’t have to ask yourself for perfection and excellence all the time.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up with the texts of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rmäs were not what Sillanpää wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but it was written based on the news in 7 days.
In the news, Jari and his ex-lover were told that Jari’s excessive partying and drinking was the cause of the separation, but Jari said it was a full pot and was not true.
Jari called the record label in anger and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters voted in favour of the split and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though the polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The slogan of Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew a scrapbook in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curriculum
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation economists have for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the impression that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it will contribute to the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were struck by the BBC's neutrality, which gave the same amount of space to economists who supported only a few per cent of the EU's economic divide as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters are about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not, in their own opinion, have common interests.
While academics in large cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overwhelming profit argument was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant rushes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments were applied.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every health center waiting room, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, the victory of the camp in favour of the EU's withdrawal, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily listing of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the EU-friendly camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, less than two weeks after voting in the real estate market were quite quiet,” Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they rushed into the situation and raised the issue to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started rolling, and the fund had to close its doors one after another.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually shut down trading, but instead changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth pulling the money out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of it withdrew the notification.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds in Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably Attention to Real Estate Funds
According to Vanhanen, closures of real estate fund trades received an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds, which were subject to closures, control about four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could hold its fund for the half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slid downwards, but the situation does not look "righter" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit period.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% off.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down on the property market in London
Two o'clock in the morning, it didn't look so good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B’s side,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent at the office, sparked news, and the usually noisy crowd was completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell the story of his divorce.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you would never have thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, in midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared for the option well, and that is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins correctional process
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market was beginning to foresee drastic bills for the property market in Britain and London in particular.
London’s office premises were forecast to be down by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the mire has fallen, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show the last days of summer holidays on Vanhanen’s face this week in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what Brexit will bring.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been reported.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the mine was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index started to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, Vanhanen says.
All equally large falls occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
According to Vanhanen, the comparison is not quite right, because this is a crisis in Britain at home.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has now seen not panic sales such as those of that time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
The funding is normally available.
The repair could have been in front of us anyway.
In fact, the price-repair movement is no wonder for him - it could have been ahead of us even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of real estate in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have been pushed upwards for four reasons, the Vanhanen list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will become globalized, Vanhanen says.
In the Middle East and Asia, new players have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city and an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has forced, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, debt leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, Disperse
In London, the rise in prices slowed down last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He dares not judge what is to come, but says that there is hardly any rising peak to be expected.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that we can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register purchase data more accurately
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the trade group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its regular customers’ purchases.
When data on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to catch it in early May on products purchased as well.
S Group is following Kesko here, as the data of the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussomomi.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups, according to simple food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintantala, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group level data, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We haven’t gone to the level of K or S, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data included occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are stored in the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terro and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cassettes anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador puppy vigorously sniffs five boxes of the same kind placed in a row in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog to play with her favorite game.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a jar of gas-inducing seals.
Ruutigas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online shop access
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work assignments may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg, Senior Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a military and explosive dog for Customs duties is the mails passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in connection with online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo, including weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In the harbours, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Finnish Defence Forces’ expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to choose from at the airport include slumping and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog has to deal with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close co-worker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle commands go to Heila from the one-time lattice.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanomas loses the camera’s mike cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cover immediately from the “irti” command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the working vest with the dog on, says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who had never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties in Customs.
State gets its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off
The Olympic gold medal in Fiji, which has a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated 22 August as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was closed.
The day off will be held the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was followed by a final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish picker fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter, Milko Tokola, succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos of thrust and 145 kilos of thrust.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to gain 175 pounds on the last one, as well as on the second one.
With the third company, the weights rose with a fierce scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting agreement with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 player agents.
Soon Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
The Prosa is expected to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people will meet with the Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the secular queen of last season, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star once again shrugs: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
As Alex Dunphy, who became familiar with the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter resurfaces with her proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making her style and behavior much more daring.
The star has posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it out here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
At the time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television for almost her entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it seems to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years’ time, as the downhill is already so hard,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glowing young woman.
The Japanese prefer to visit Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start their Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn,” Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main attractions of Japanese Northern Lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter northern lights are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely do we know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the Northern Lights, making the vision two times fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land survey among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights of Finland, and according to Lind, the Northern Lights have huge potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fidi leads the championship course to gold
The impressive progress of the UK in the rugby tournament collapsed on Fiji’s final challenge in Thursday night’s final, when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master course in handling, breaking, dodgeing, supporting, running and silk, winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable consolation from the silver medal - the third of Britain's day - and they were allowed to be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, during which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough 7-5 win of the semi-final that was played the same day could have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, a former English boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament, coached by Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This backseat hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently, repelling Britain's struggles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they had run a moving bus, and world champions led the 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the finish area.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant fight stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it was only a slow one for Fiji.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, with the UK losing 17-0.
Nakarawa scored another goal for a new start, and the watch still had more than a minute left...for the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through the UK's loose tacks and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the crash, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's what it really is.
The UK took a break and made a series of changes that blocked the Fid Dam...for a total of four minutes, which was fine compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK on the left corner of the touchdown, narrowing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the auditoriums.
It was hard not to admire Fidi’s joyful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was a frosting in Fidi's cake that didn't need frosting.
The pill was whistled, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell to the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had defeated Japan in the semi-finals of 20-5, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final, where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with a dazzling foot job and scored a goal below the goalposts in the second half.
A great late fight by Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured a win and finally a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer drove Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotion-inspiring gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, with 220 heavy throws towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
While they rowed alone, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time, as the two competed for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pair race - the first women in the history books of British sports that achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the surface with the swan's sweetness, not entirely reflecting the nature of the victory.
Behind every rowing bowl is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, after 30 months of cancer diagnosis, did not know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was a mess.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things I can cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start their treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disturbance as possible – if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a bit bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts were about Williams, who had had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been on a tunnel train this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen and Robin have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their rivals did not reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen yelled, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good row and race, and so we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be attending a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on me.
It took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to replace Panama leaked government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already demanded in the spring by protestors who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circulated taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-day rage of the people will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June, the presidential election showed clear criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest rumours.
He said he was sarcastic in asserting that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and Democratic candidate of ISIS, Hillary Clinton, as well as a member of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious at the talks and demanded an apology from Trump.
“The commander-in-chief of the army should never be allowed to let anyone who can sink like that down,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-populated burkini bathing suits on the beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a good habit and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which express large amounts of religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating France’s National Day.
At the end of July, two men linked to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-green clay has been observed on the P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococci bacteria in all bathing areas were below the limits set by the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had dropped below the action limits.
The blue algae deposits found in the bathing area of P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi do not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue algae flowers, thus forming a blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water in the form of ferries.
Environmental action follows the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue algae precipitate turns into a blue algae flower, this will also be communicated separately on the beach notification table.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
Tax deductions are proposed for income taxes, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the applicant will find something to criticise in the proposal for a tax change.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a task for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
VM’s proposal starts with a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry, which prevents the loss of capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell a tree.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit related to the yield value of forests is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, he said, it would remove 82% of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the space size.
According to Hakkarainen, a forest gift reduction has been carried out in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special retreat on Friday morning at the Kalajoki Himanga.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars that ran in a row fell into a ditch, after which the person in the back collided with the time ahead.
Harri Pyhtiät, the firefighter of the day, said that the fall into the ditch was suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
In the back, there were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the cancer tumor increases the malignant nature of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home death continues in court, prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
Muhos’ family home death continues in court for both convicted people.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for family home murder in Muhos.
The second received 8 years 4 months, including the murder and aggravated robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing was also convicted of a serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as a young person without rights.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the defendants and the man who had been convicted more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been sentenced to a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a child protection unit at the school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was sentenced to death, allegedly attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The pilot had gotten out of his grip and had brought the young man into his room, and one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing at 156 years old
The world’s longest living vertebrate is a confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female is not growing until she is 156 years old.
The fact that it grows only one centimeter per year increases the life span of the ice shark.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The researchers found out his age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s change to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced by tax breaks, which are particularly beneficial to the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency services must be renewed and the energy sector must be deregulated.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts rather than bureaucrats".
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organised protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists — including those close to the Republicans — see Trump’s program leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday.
A wave of shocks from the past - People's News
The sea is dying, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street vigil - accounting with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Lovers of Travel (2013) was a little fun and a rosque satirical comedy, the previous Skin where I live (2011) at the top of my career as a Spanish tourist.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between the two works.
It is a conciliatory love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and we see it as a long retreat.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta timed the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, appears in the second female lead role, as a TV friend from the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a rope, but I would say that time is audacious and literally with a one-time swipe.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to such a characteristic glamour.
It is a well-played, restrained, place in places with good music and a rather sadistic film with elements of elegance.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is there, and so that it slowly begins to put more into the eye as a pure form than as a functional dramatic effect.
People in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains just as flat.
This is especially true for the costume: in the case of a noun, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the eye-catching ears.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is to say, the tunings of the current scene, will not be improved in any particular way.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly spiritual.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a script based on three short stories by Alice Munro, a Canadian writer, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-weight literary filming.
The material would have been emotionally incomparable to a more gritty drama, so much of the big things - especially the sloppy guilt - are dealt with in the film's theme.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
With Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiered on August 12.8.
The government is trying to win the election - People's News
No new cuts will be made, they say, so that the Finns will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out with a lot of trade.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This convinces Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (cook) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because the social security cuts were already decided in the spring spending limits.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefits is reduced from 500 days to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipalities haunting
Why are ministers so keenly emphasising the fact that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the Gallup.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election, which takes the parties of the government in different directions, will spoil the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup, however, reports that the Prime Minister’s party expects the Finns to lose, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new councillors, most of whom will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of roughly the same size is based on the fact that the position of the Finns will last.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted in the party have had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
There will be no new cuts in the rhetoric, firstly, to confuse the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, to try to soften the blow waiting for the Finns.
Large cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the target of debt reduction during this parliamentary term, but the budget proposal for Petteri Orpo will take up EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt does not bend or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even more cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, the parliamentary elections will take over what will happen.
With these measures, the debt will not fall.
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be overcome, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the information conference on the budget prove it irrefutable:
The forecasts for growth in the global economy have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade and has extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be virtually completely covered by new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the Finns as to what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also imposes responsibility on the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic studies, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with disabilities are the most important goals for the county.
There is no transfer of any of the responsibilities of the municipalities to the state.
The underage drunk ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol to Ilomantsi on Friday night at half past midnight.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police at a fair speed.
The race continued on Sonkajanranta road, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-legged police officer ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo crashed into a ditch
The truck in Kivilasti fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell to its side in a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the responsibility of the owner of the car to lift the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was poured onto the road, which was absorbed by the rescue service into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki’s Lahti village in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 centimetres tall, slender and well-groomed and has white hair under her chin.
Observations and clues about missing movements are requested by calling the emergency number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The elements of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery Parafest's destruction
The surge that fell at the Parafest Festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the Market Square at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 pm.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The eavesdropping flow occurs in the thunderstorm cloud when the rainwater and its weight trigger the falling air flow.
Changes in the state of water in the upper cloud bind heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and its rate towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the eavesdropping currents.
The rush flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were destroyed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were injured in the accident.
There was one child among them, who was transported slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution is ageing the Londoners.
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The study was conducted by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people living in London is two and a half years older than that of people living in rural areas, for example.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who walk around busy streets on their commutes.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard by a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the extent that he was taken to the central hospital seriously injured in further investigations.
The tractor did not have time to go further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays for the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from a better starting point than the men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tune is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Riento’s main coach, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and united.
Fred Musoni, a middle-backed foreign trio, begins his second term at Riento.
The new faces include 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passari, Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoi to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Floorball Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better in the North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the kind of sport that was played on the SM level was not yet played as a salibandy.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoja in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the SM-series of the 1991-92 season with the University, the following three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminating in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series for 10 seasons, with a balance of 169 in 51+34=85.
The latest season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen appointed to national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolainen-based Tatu Väänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking Erä in Helsinki, has played six men’s country matches, where he has accumulated a total score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from travel problems and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 country matches.
The national team was also named for Mika Kohonen, a competitor of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The main coach of the team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to end as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley’s Finnish championships will be decided this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, the medals are played in both adult and young series.
In co-operation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, six best pairs of each series will be qualified for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäki NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the auditorium this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesisstadion.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu's spark for sport and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are many memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 with Elimäki’s NMKY E-girls.
The top one is too big a toy shirt in mind, knee pads on the ankles and huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of sport in junior years to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
Bits have been played on the beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors’ championships, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksämäki’s Anniina Parkkinen in SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
The real goal is to have a medal.
SM gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The high tide poured tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, the big accident was near
The eavesdropping flow poured out three tents at Parafest Festivals for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.

There was a big show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
Firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by a Karelian, tells the newspaper that there were elements of a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
Young farmer Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and her younger brother, Valtteri Koli, began working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yardyard, and at first the bank was not too excited about it.
However, I went into the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the competition for a young food producer in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote on the newspaper’s website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2 % was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost-of-living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
At the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricature
Snapchat says anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it’s racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are simple, face-sharp tools that produce over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for advertising a blackface mask or favoring bleached skin color as a beauty product.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens for some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface".
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s bigger problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that “it’s hard to argue against a comparison that has side-by-side an outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects.”
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow-faced mask, but a yellow-faced mask with extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse youth audience may mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, “it’s much more difficult for these guys to be undetectable.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing for Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s chiefly white male leadership and ended his writing with a hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this,” Zhu said, “or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they aren’t in positions where they feel safe or could speak out.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss its staff’s racial background, but according to the representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and move forward with internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said to keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "It is true that they actually need more users like us in order to say that this is not okay."
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that the authorities at the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces Military Department had edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of the Republican Chairman of the House Defence Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Working Group of the Defence Appropriation Subcommittee found “a widespread discontent” among the headquarters intelligence analysts who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the Americans’ efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcomina, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S.’s anti-terrorist efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground. They were consistently more positive than the analyses produced by other sources of the intelligence community,” the report said in a press release.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," spokesman Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that high-ranking government officials in the Obama administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as having felt as if Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters’ press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack on Mosul’s recapture could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence officers at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the headquarters’s intelligence outputs to mitigate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after they heard that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has begun an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's inquiry.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a unnecessarily isolated process for the intelligence assessment of IS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's lead Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process “prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs,” worsened the mood among analysts, and “did not give enough room for different perspectives.”
Schiff and the Democrats said they couldn’t find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to agree on a “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s chief inspector had begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon representative, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the Intelligence Community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions than just the question of whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defense authorities now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects the controversy over more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, the Hooker group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against the Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate as a over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins women’s country hockey for the fourth time in a row, holding a cross-check with Britain
On Thursday, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's country hockey team in India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings."
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 position at the Olympic tournament and they share their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face the first round in the final game on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarter-finals, and this game will decide who will take first place and who will take second in their group of six teams.
The first placed avoids a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, Americans have been agitated by their surprising success here, four years after they were the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up the country hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the game at Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympic Games because he was not included in the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've done a full translation.
On Thursday evening, Bam started his first half-time goal-making with a fist-stitch near the goal.
India had entered the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time from the left side of the field, then turned around in the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added a fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero-game was the tournament's first US goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Peace of Trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming message that is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a guest’s conversation in a coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-timer and future heartbreaker with a smile bump, could well be one of the names everyone knows, which is presented at the best viewing times, supported by sponsorship agreements and good-spirited TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for the Olympic gold medal in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Far from the center, partly in the shade, are the species that not everyone generally accepts: air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, its presence in the past 16 years has been so limited that many of whom I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie McLennan will defend London’s gold medals.
Trampoline, however, is accompanied by a certain charm of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just a no-fly fan.
There are opportunities for fun in the species, as is noted by the vibration of endless pompos of cartoon characters, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumping, two species that in principle combine in it.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means springboard.
The goalkeepers of the championship jumped with a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet, and they have to complete winding sequences (translations, folds and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those wishing for medals must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another devious frontier: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even get the viewer into tears.
But that’s also the reason why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a rest moment here.
Trampoline direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor ascends to a new ascent, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no leaps to the distance, only a dreamy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to the Zen space as you can get at the Olympics.
Women’s qualifying competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 1 pm (ET), while men’s races will also be held on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of an Olympic narration, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male athletes to stare and objectify (as suggested by the U.S. male gymnasts some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his stupendous new fandom.
"The Generation Shows Its Mind" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, in recent months, anti-government demonstrations have shaken the country as it spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Widespread videos recorded in demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while forcing them to stand on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital city of Addis Ababa is even a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the oppression of the government, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
“If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, this will happen,” Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All young people show their minds.
One generation shows their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the punitive nature of the ruling coalition power.
After last year's highly criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies were given the last position held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why after years of overburdening, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate with the location via hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, the oroms and amharas, are better at coping with each other.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by using oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"We're on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in Amharic and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the Tigre people, which covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make his opponents harmless.
"The current administration has no such basic instinct," Abdi, a conflict analyst, said.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre area of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the Tigre-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a state of turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested at elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been first shattered and then robbed by the government.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anger against tigers is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed this base.
While the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable allies to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balance."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Basic-Isis Claims to Be 'Asarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to repress his latest campaign that triggered the controversy on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly urged President Obama and Hillary Clinton this week that they were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following the suggestion made at Wednesday’s campaign meeting, Trump said the same thing was increasingly asserted in Thursday’s interviews, in which he urged that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
In an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a complete reversal of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took it to his hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes at a time when Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of declining polls.
Trump and Clinton fought for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after he apparently faced widespread criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "I guess I'm sarcastic."
The approach will allow Trump to make a political speech at the borders and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'explain' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's a little sloppy about his statements and knows that they're vague enough to filter through several different lenses.
Instead of relieving his speeches for the general public, Trump has been more gallant in recent days as his popularity continues to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump is lagging behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for what he says about provoking things, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an ever closer look at the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they need to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, made a lot of effort defending the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which grinds his every word and is biased against him.
He ridiculed “bad, pitiful” television experts who are trying to find out about him, saying, “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s excuse as a new piece of evidence that he was unfit for president.
Previous closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue's sidewalk was too expensive for it.
The business that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps shaped like a cup cake.
The locals lamented it as the last loss in a middle-class city to be renovated.
Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinventing.
The revamped Verb opened in November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb features Wi-Fi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unscrupulous atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same way.
Verb uses the same bagels supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-potato-cheese-cheese sandwiches, and covers include capers and fried onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
Beer is no longer served in the café, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
“Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers,” he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a moment.
“I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
“Every day at fifteen over seven, regularly like the clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagel with butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation he places a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge on the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare a special soap for Verbi using cold-extracted coffee as an ingredient.
“I think we can still grab the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to put it up somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a loyal customer and said it was comforting when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt as if he had come home when he walked inside and ordered coffee.
“I needed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The paralyzing food of the depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as goose liver paste, and Maryland's marshmallow soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from a plum pudding.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for the people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating the lay season.
"The bruises were very popular," Ziegelman said.
It was peanut-free, liver-free, poppy-pollinated.
They were made of the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe was smirking.
"It must have felt like a lead in the stomach," he said.
Years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like an eating-so-much-like-jaksat-picking table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The American people sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War, and the book A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
“At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery food species such as crumbs and boxes became the main foods, and the box was a “great way to use food stars,” mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a cost-effectively dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
During the study, Ziegelman also prepared an era dish for a book containing recipes, where fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Households from 1923 to 1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and respond to the challenge of converting muffled spaghetti and carrot-like lumps into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic makupos.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat the cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “provided not only one of Washington’s toughest, but also the worst-made, food.”
Many of the paralysed eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, for example, how she could not throw away food.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
The dessert had no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all plunged their spoons into a sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sang one and the other.
Sounds like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: “A little bit of chopped walnuts could help.”
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal costs in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. Attorney General has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to a lawyer’s fee for a lawsuit against Merck & Co Inc, a drug manufacturer involved in the hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in fees after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, followed by a US judge who discovered Merck's abuses, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman, the U.S. betrothed judge, said Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it had received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can significantly improve over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over Manbij, ruled by ISIS
U.S.-backed troops have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing-winged prisoners who were held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's allied force, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book, which reported on his career at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice president, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, have published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter, announcing a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit was completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his transactions, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem by posting an online video on Friday showing prominent Republicans urging Trump to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: he has published his tax returns,” he told the audience.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has an ongoing audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not “fearing” the tax collector’s office, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and sparklers boost elephant protection in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering to human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, along with the American Nature Conservancy, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use nonviolent four-step ways to protect homes and hundreds of homes without hurting the animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...tools, we’ve seen a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include showing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth, and with a sparkle, after which the condom is wrapped so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When a condom is ignited, it bursts, bursting, and bursts the chili powder dust into the air.
One click is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last means is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes a Berlin hotel that removed Israel’s landmark number at the request of Arabs
The French Jewish filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel’s country code. According to the employee, this is due to the “requests” of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the film Shoah about the Holocaust, dismantled his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During their recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of country codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Kempinski Bristol, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to call Israel via its own telephone system.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker talked about it at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was "shocking at him."
The hotel’s prescription specialist said it was “a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s number,” the employee said.
Israel’s German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case “a great injustice,” reports Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
“We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shameful is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski Hotel simply "gave up" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Fear," said another publication, which pointed out that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what had happened “inaccuracy” and “forgave” Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
“A clear command not to include Israel in the quick-selection list was never made,” Kempinski’s representative said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the heading number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students showing their mind
On Thursday, students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, where students gathered to protest against reforms in the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to disperse the student population, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
Sao Paolo’s governor, Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, said that fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the demonstrators took off as a group to support President Dilma Roussef, who was arrested, while the country's Senate voted on his charges.
RT Business: trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71%
After the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Following the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Naturally, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bi-directional cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth of the trade was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia for the first time.
“It is safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian fighters in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Skotitti Callum Skinner hit the finish line with British cyclists grabbing a bicycle gold
Callum Skinner from Scotland praised the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night when the British team's three champions defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Roy, a legend who was proud of the young man, as he competed for the victory by winning a favor from the New Zealand team.
Four years ago, the United Kingdom won the shock, while Hoy won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing themselves in sixth place at the March World Championships in London, although Hoy has since ended his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of special dispatcher Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches in relation to the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made the Olympic record on time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British triple won a duel on gold.
After his own tour, Hindes was a bit behind, but Kenny pushed the team to the top, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving at a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “Comparition is flattering.”
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain’s rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten cycling races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are waiting for a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (on that apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoy this one.
Team racing is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the knight's value."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owai Doull were the fastest four-man, four-kilometer teamback ever.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 gold record in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time runs, when the officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed in world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take control of the central part of the Olympic Games and achieve a whole host of medals.
After a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio Games.
There has been a drama in the background, the least of which has not been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and temptation, as well as the end of the race for big people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night of the race at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that the now legendary British reputation could once again be true.
The future of the Portland meltdown is questionable due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victorian aluminium alloy, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory’s owners is closing a distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows a decision made earlier this year by the Victorian government that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, due to the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelt consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum alloy plant in the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three other owners to conclude their contract.
The majority of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity needs for the meltless will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“That’s why AGL expects the contracts to yield results in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already "pre-emptively" reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the agreements “will not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the smelt in operation or secure the supply of electricity from the smelt.”
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert both to the Portland meltdown in Victoria and to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants leave the market, it will be a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of Vogue in September.
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the desired September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for problematic cases Rob and Caitlyn, and which was accompanied by everyone’s favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest, forgot the cover of his sister, but ended with a classic twist: they also planned the cover.
It's a cliché of almost every children's television series "birthday episode" (Seacrest chants the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-drawn bunny), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to a new era of Kardashians with Vogue’s place in September.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have reached Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own category.
Vogue’s September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee book than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page last year had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so eagerly expected that for the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Previous women on the deck have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebs that act as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of his generation, fell into the first category, he would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are justifiably talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, Beyoncé’s cover model last year has been one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be a bit of a nuisance.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of this moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But running in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all of his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications found behind the payment wall.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she took to LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a reality TV star.
Community Legal Centres Turn 160,000 People Away Every Year
The most vulnerable of more than 160,000 people will be expelled from the Community's legal centres every year as the sector prepares for the impact of additional financial cuts on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the Community's extremes are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“The legal centres of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government is cutting funding by 30% in June 2017, which means thousands of defenseless Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on both the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government implemented its pledge to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was sued after an employee was threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign’s chief of operations in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit brought by former software trainee Vincent Bordin in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Brodini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that “it wouldn’t happen.”
Chief Earl Phillip "takes out the pistol, puts his right forefinger on the trigger, and pushes the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bodini heard that at least four other people had had similar experiences with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
“We don’t need to launch weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked anger when he told the public in North Carolina that “people of the second increase” — which usually includes gun owners and gunners — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his word out of context and that he did not support violence.
Burdini’s challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for careless control and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comments.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported Phillip had recently left the campaign.
His call request to Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is against Bodini by Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we do that again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the London 2012 Games, some will come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3> 211 billion, both leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented an infrastructure investment program of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion on time and on budget: from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is one of them.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play about blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass an ad-blocker program are "cat and mouse games," said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update program filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the code of its websites would be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's been circling a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of round-the-clock struggle between an open-source ad-blocking community and its circlers has been going on ever since ad-blocking was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much sorrow advertising blockers have become to the industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, which is nearly four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is after ad blockers on computer pages because mobile ad blockers don’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads are still generating enough revenue to make Facebook consider such an action worth investing in.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “advertisement mindset” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem,” a Facebook representative said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why instead we’ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway after suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was left on a highway under several vehicles in the early hours of Thursday, in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a “desperate act” and lay in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, the police said, appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation," attorney Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
“It remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It will be up to the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases, where there was a person walking on a dark highway, it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released on charges of negligence on the death penalty after he hit and killed a man who lay on A! Road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had gone out of the way, the court was told.
The court found that the police, responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabited once.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’s past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether Venus could have had a hot, water-free surface and the ability to fill carbon dioxide with its atmospheres at some point could have been earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthy atmosphere, and it could still have swirled slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect it from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of being 30 per cent dimmed by the sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sunny sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth’s current ones.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus probably had to be inhabited once in a while, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach's nest
Patrick Roy resigned from the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of hockey on Thursday as a reason for the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/director Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have been doing my duty as Vice President and Chief Coach for Hockey in Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During the summer I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey matters must be fully in line with the vision of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a central division victory, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
The North Sea oil workers’ labor struggles due to wages are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly on drilling rigs in the North Sea led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the process to resolve the current dispute," the joint statement read.
We will hold several full-day meetings in the next few weeks, starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent labor action, which they say will be the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut fees for North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the necessary space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off their payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with allied leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's largest North Sea labour disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian star cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete list of the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds and how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born around 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
At its peak rotational speed, these adult stars are ejected from large amounts of star winds.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the larger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘balet’ of the players, we see that slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating star properties at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that comprise both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiadians in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
