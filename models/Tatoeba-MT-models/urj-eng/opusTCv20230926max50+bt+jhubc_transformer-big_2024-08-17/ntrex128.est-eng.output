Members of the National Assembly of Wales are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been dismayed by the recommendation to change their term of office to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the beginning of a plan to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One member of the National Assembly, a member of the Labour Party, said that his groupmates are concerned because it rhymes with the words “Twp and Pwp”.
To explain to readers outside of Wales: the word daft in Welsh means navel, and pwp means kaka.
A member of the plaque said that the entire group as a whole “is not happy” and has offered other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Party said his group was "responsive" to the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
For explanation: In Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to that of Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are called, of course, is made by the members themselves.”
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into proposals concerning the name, which broadly supports the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name “WMP” but the participants in the public poll most favoured the option “MWP”.
The members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft law on amendments in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly shall remain with the members themselves in the debate on the legislation.
Macedonians to hold referendum on changing the country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum will be held with the aim of resolving the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents the claim to this territory and has repeatedly objected to the EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that changing the name is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because Harlem churches are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there used to be one bar and one church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one else.”
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people stay every day.”
When it comes to churches, however, he worries that the money from selling the assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “earlier or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not give a helping hand to the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis <0xE2><0x88><0x92> Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black congregation, who had worshiped God so far, took over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of the 125th Street shopping street of Harlem, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by the fire, but when members of the Johnson congregation planned to rebuild the building, they adopted a carnival or a clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and heir to St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the lion “the bells of the poor people.”
However, the expert who played the title of the Mayer gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world’s first ever championship, played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger one at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by secular church leaders, others by the bishopric, has been played in St. Martin’s Church in recent months.
In July, the church’s presidency, or the governing body of the church, made up of secular leaders, complained in writing to the bishopric that the bishopric “is trying to pass on costs,” although the presidency was not even linked to the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the actions of the bishopric.
In California, shark injured a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters
Authorities say the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into California for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s rescue herds and then swam in with others to help him get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting the lobster, but “then it was understood that the boy shouted, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
“The whole of his collarbone was bare,” Hammel described the sight he saw as he approached the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water and say, ‘There’s a shark in the water,’” Hammel added.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken on a plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The shark species that has been attacked is still unknown.
The rescuer and captain, Larry Giles, told a news conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was determined that this was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, from Casablanca to Swamini, for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury takes over the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, creating supermarket-like beauty shops with expert advisors.
As part of a significant push to the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion, which is on the rise as the sales of fashion and home goods continue to decline, the wider range of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, bringing them into use in other stores next year if successful.
Beauty products are being invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the previously allocated shelf space for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
Available product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also provide more space in brand areas such as those currently available in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket is re-launching its make-up line Boutique, in which most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test exclusive sales licenses at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second will be opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Buying online and switching to buying small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe has said sales outlets are starting to look more and more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight off low-cost chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
In Sainsbury, Argos has put sales outlets in hundreds of stores, the same with sales outlets in Habitats, as Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and medicinal products departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with an argument about how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its 281 sons to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxurious skin care products to the range of its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the surrounding environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our range of brands meets every need. However, the approachable environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trading, which can change old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left “infuriated” when TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned a $11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is short of time for the brand of home goods and clothing.
A couple of businesses have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of this morning TV show announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den’s star Peter Jones in a rage, stepping out of their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources told me that Jones was “sorry” when a television star girl admitted at a tense meeting at her business headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to devote herself to the brand of homewear and clothing.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for his vacation home.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure her distant future, so she thought she would deal with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left it all in complete confusion.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the launch of the product line.
Marlow’s headquarters have a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that leaving one of the UK’s most paid celebrities on this Morning TV show could cost the company millions, because products ranging from sofa mattresses and candles to clothes and home clothes have invested a sizable amount of money and could also lead to the product being introduced later.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and his wife Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby joined Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
One of Jones’ close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard talk, "because of what we fell in love with"
Trump joked about the criticism that had been addressed to him in the news for a comment that some people consider to be “worthless to the president” and over-positive towards the North Korean head of state.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his “newsman’s voice”:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s withdrawal from nuclear weapons.
However, the nuclear non-proliferation talks have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the U.S.’s “corresponding reaction” to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
He said the United States would continue with pressure restrictions.
Trump’s inspirational speech was much more enjoyable.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now everything is very good between us.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the repatriation of the remains of American servants.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get to this full-top stadium, it’s better if we have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In order to eliminate the consequences of the Lomboki earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international help, so the stories are a little complicated,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children brings together a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palus in order to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid delivery.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly poorly prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although Aceh has built shelters for tsunamis, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palus probably increased the number of deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is also quite challenging at the best times.
Natural disasters make the logistics there even more complicated.
A hospital ship stopped in Lomboki to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palus, but it takes at least three days to arrive at a new accident site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the fragmented infrastructure in Indonesia a central part of his election campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr Joko is also pressured by the tensions in Indonesia among the most partisans, where members of the Muslim community have turned to a more primitive form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands left their homes on the streets due to Christian-Muslim fighting using machetes, bows, arrows, and other original weapons.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge beats Chelsea at the gate
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, fidgeting in the 89th minute of the game at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 meters from Chelsea Gate, when his team led 1 : 0.
He hit the ball to the left of himself before hitting it in the direction of a distant post.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over with the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq will give the ball as much as possible forward, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I hit him with no thought at all.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0, thanks to the goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute of the game.
In this game, the Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before turning around in the middle field and rushing to Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick feed in the middle field.
He then created a beautiful airstrip, leading Hazard to the penitentiary.
Hazard got through the defense and scored the ball with his left foot in the direction of a remote post from Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play for the Napoli Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague on Thursday at 3 p.m.
Indonesia's Tsunami Deaths Rise to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the National Disaster Board said on Sunday morning.
A large number of people were trapped under the rubble of buildings that had collapsed due to a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after stabbing a woman to death
The murder investigation began after a woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with a puncture wound was found at 07:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man has been arrested.
The police are calling on people in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is only quite early, but I would ask anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they heard or saw anything suspicious.
I would also ask all taxi drivers, especially those whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged female friends came to the scene, asking questions about where the woman was found in the morning.
The investigation is underway, and the police said they are informing the woman's close relatives at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was stunned when he heard about the incident.
Residents were told that getting into their house again could take hours.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was in tears at the scene.
He always said, “It’s horrible.”
At two in the afternoon, there were still two police buses in the closed area, and a third one right next to it.
A large number of police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 using the keyword 30 September log 247.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument to be commemorated as the cause of the “rewrite of history” controversy
Removing it would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts in the Taliban style that man’s inhumane patrons did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as a stupidity and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell’s memorial in front of Westminster Palace to remain intact.
Cromwell did not plunder the pictures himself in the English Civil War, nor did he tell others to do so.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell man was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historical description of the person to whom many people still believe should be honored.”
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people viewed Cromwell’s parliament as a defender at the end of the 19th, rather than today, of external pressure and, in this case, of course, of royal power.
Whether this is accurate coverage is an endless historical dispute.
What is certain is that the struggle of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as the Lord’s Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Chinese Farmer Trimmed to Death with Killer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer on the market in southwest China who killed a man.
The man, who was identified with the name Yuan only, was found dead and covered with blood from the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, near the wild boar market, with the injured artery, reported the South China newspaper “Morning Post” on Sunday.
The pig keeper was manufactured on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China to vaccinate pigs in its barn.
He had reportedly come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the man’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the surrounding area was open.
He said that the seagull had a great bloody mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 249,47 kilograms of ore had been bullied to the death of the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were completely bloody and bruised,” Wu said.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market Thursday morning at 4:40 am to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are reportedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms was nailed to the tractor of a Welsh farmer until a man’s wife scared the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs usually don’t attack, but because of the taste of their blood, they may get dizzy.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious Maracrats, whose purpose is not to injure.
You just have to respect them enough,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tailwinds bring massive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken, moving across the northern coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, Rosa will bring rainstorms to northern Mexico and the US southwest in the coming days.
At 5 p.m. on Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a first-class hurricane with winds blowing 136.78 kilometers per hour, 619.59 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure atmosphere is emerging over the Pacific, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it begins to divert deep tropical moisture to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa arrives in Mexico on Monday, where it rains up to 25.4 centimeters.
Then, in the south-west of the country, the reactionary tropical moisture with the approaching low-pressure atmosphere will cause extensive strong rain showers in the coming days.
At times, the rain that fell between 2.54 and 10.16 centimeters causes dangerous sudden floods, floodwaters, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes precipitation to increase to about five to seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres of precipitation will occur in certain regions of the southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to the dispersion of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
You should not walk in the desert if there is a risk of tropical rain.
Strong rain can cause canyons to turn into high-speed rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by windstorms and volatile dust.
The near-low pressure sometimes brings with it fierce rains in the coastal areas of Southern California.
A total rainfall of over 1.27 centimeters is possible and can lead to lower flooding and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The scattered tropical rain lights will approach Arizona late on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, and the rain showers will widen on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Strong rains arrive at Four Corner on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. is forecast to experience major temperature fluctuations caused by Arctic cooling, while tropical temperatures remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday’s weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, they will try to recover a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern United States is expected to start in warm October with a wide range of temperatures of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, from the southern plains to the north-east of the country.
In New York City, 26.6 degrees of heat are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday via six TV channels the proselytizing confessions of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who allegedly accused her of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, in which broadcasters stopped broadcasting conventional broadcasts to reflect the last minute turns of Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake prepared a deal with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk with his head and tried to rip off his wife’s clothes at the high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems in calculating the number of people who are watching the transmissions in the authorities.
For comparison, this is about the same size of the audience as the football finals or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel’s opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers at a full-day session, Nielsen said.
With 3.26 million viewers, ABC was second.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high even after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a statement from the office of a moderate Republican saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning after he had been subjected to a riot by protesters, trying to go to a court of law with an elevator.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and was transferred directly to CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the state?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the sitting of the Legal Affairs Committee before the elevator closed.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected the live broadcast several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to refer Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate Assembly for voting.
But Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s accusations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of political play
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who criticized his plans to leave the European Union, “in a political game” with Britain’s future and harming national interest.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on May’s “Brexit plan,” saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should build tariffs on each other was “completely brainless.”
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested and placed in prison for a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, adding that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, a CBS-owned television channel WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer said the man’s bailout was set at $350,000 ($308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday that caused a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugees Operational Team, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the people living in the area for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
Joe Alleva, LSU sports manager, thanked the area’s law enforcement authorities for “establishing care and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98-meter-long man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
The average number of games in his previous season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team had been “hit” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“That’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano bursts ashes over Mexico City
The ash that erupts from a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater resumed operations that resulted in 183 cases of gas emissions and ashes being recorded within 24 hours.
The centre covered a number of noises and tremors.
The images shared on social media depicted the ash-covered car windscreen in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake devastated central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police face clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the clash of pro-independence protesters with the riot police. Thousands joined the opposing protests to celebrate Catalonia's opposing vote to withdraw.
The group of masked sequestration fighters, held back by the riot police, attacked the last eggs and powder paint, creating a thick dust cloud on the streets, usually full of tourists.
R<0xC3><0xBC>selusi also emerged later when the police had to use the squats to control the fights.
For several hours, supporters of independence who sang “No Forgetfulness, No Forgiveness” clashed with pro-state unity protesters who called “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries received medical care during the demonstrations.
The tensions continue to be high in the area of independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which was still celebrated by Catalans in favor of separation.
The voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although the turnout was low, as those who opposed the withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent voting in front of polling stations throughout the region, leading to violent clashes.
The proponents of independence had stayed in front of the polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a demonstration with his wife in favor of separation, said he no longer had the hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent country.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry out with joy about the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important but small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the independence of Catalonia to maintain their condemnation this year, as a number of the most prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their part in organising a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a demonstration with his mobile phone to support the police, said the dispute was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“A candidate for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested after a car raided the house
Three men between the ages of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was repeatedly raided in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a bow arrow could also be fired.
Menga's strike gives Livingston a 1–0 win in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston wins
The promoted Livingston raided the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games, during which he was the manager of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Menga blow proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in seconds.
Gerrard will not win in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, eight of whom will be down.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded its invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston loses the chance to get rid of n<0xC3><0xBC>r's visitors
The Holt team should have been leading long before the goal was scored, as their direct style of play caused Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts sank in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit Craig Halkett over the top of the gate.
Hosts calmly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems for guests in certain places.
And this is also the way the determining gate was struck.
The Rangers unleashed a free kick, and Livingston had the opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers had mostly possession of the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, making the goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor repelled Scott Pittman's strike and Lithgow brightened in another team effort at Livingston.
The blows constantly reached Livingston's penalty area and were consistently fired from there, and two penalty shots were directed away, one for Halkett's Glenn Middleton substitution attempt and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, surpassing expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and their players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt must be honored for the way he has hardened the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worthall on their hind legs throughout the game.
The Rangers were inspired.
Regardless of their intermediate good level under Gerrard's leadership, this was little of it, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be incomplete: reaching the home side took place only once, which could serve as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (29 September) there were both smiles and a cloud of worry when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police referred to security by banning the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds protested against Erdogan, a large part of whom were Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show a split attitude towards the guest: some Turks living in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise the man as a self-governing ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist who hit a car in London was killed.
The collision took place on a fast-paced road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and the help came to the ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometers from a Saturday crash site on Childers Street, where a driver who ran to the rider escaped from the scene.
London police said the authorities were working on identifying the man and informing his loved ones.
At the event, traffic is closed and buses are rerouted, drivers of motor vehicles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartini prison: Six prison officers injured in riots
The prison authorities reported that six prison officers were injured in the riots in a highly secure men’s prison.
The riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time and have not yet ended.
One of the wing’s concentrated riots involving eight inmates has been attended by expert riot police.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Special training prison workers have been called to solve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartini prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartinis has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, a riot police was called into prison to silence the serious unrest in which prison officers were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Sudden Floods
The tropical low pressure does not hit Arizona often, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week, as the retreating hurricane Rosa moves across the U.S. southwest desert, leading to the threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already organised a surveillance of the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfalls.
Phoenix State Weather Service said: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure level within a radius of 321.86 kilometres from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfalls of 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres, which can reach up to 15.24 centimetres in the restricted areas of the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other desert areas in the U.S. south-east, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Plain, rainfall is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching up to 10.16 centimeters in restricted areas.
Rosa rains can be a blessing to areas that tolerate sudden floods, as the area is suffering from drought.
While the floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be beneficial, as drought is prevalent in South America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona’s population is affected by extreme drought, the second-largest drought, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses California’s peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still on the hurricane level with the largest windshields at 6.43 kilometres per hour, is currently 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a rate of 19.31 kilometers per hour north.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore a little quieter.
Rosa is expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with a tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of precipitation in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwestern part of Sonora, rainfalls of 7.62 to 15.24 centimeters in total can be expected, sometimes up to 25.4 centimeters,” said weather.com.
Rosa then heads north over Mexico in a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure force moving across Arizona and reaching south of Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is the very strong rain showers in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rain lights can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of a planned murder after a 16-year-old boy with a puncture wound was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
The victim was taken to hospital in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records in the case.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered” the Democratic Party under “truth and hatred.”
“Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a rallying speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “beared” during his appointment process under the Democratic Party’s “truth and hatred.”
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, rebuffing sharply and emotionally the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified on his charges at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “America saw Kavanaugh’s glory, quality, and courage that day.”
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most esteemed lawyers of our time with an impeccable background in public service,” he told a crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m actually running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and stop.”
The first main ballot on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, Republican party leaders senior CNN said.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were drowned when the giant waves invaded the beach after a severe earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come to the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when, during the rainy season, they created six-metre waves on the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the way.
Tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their own thing on the beach, not running away right away, thus remaining victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs and houses with it, sweeping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving on the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 centres.
Air photos published by the Disaster Management Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The remains continued in the coastal town on Saturday.
In the region with 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released after a severe earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times higher than that of a nuclear bomb that was destroyed in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city on the long and narrow bay could increase the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as “excellent” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be higher in the coastal area 300 km north of Palus called Donggala, which was closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggaa “are completely incomplete and contain no information,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy that can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur cartoons on social media can see a man on the upper floor of a building who panicously warns people on the street below against the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which prevented communications in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue work.
The military has started sending transport aircraft to help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed in the rest until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami increased by over 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggai safely reached the city of Palu, where they were hiding in the stands in their office courtyard, they saw devastating sightings on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said you saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While the relief forces vigorously began disaster relief operations, some complained that workers from large-scale foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Palusse.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and assistance may be sent from abroad only if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international aid, but that’s not yet declared.
When the second night of Palus arrived after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing people were still filled with the hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful cases that ease the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of a sewer well.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman trapped next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of Indonesia’s national ice hockey team, trained two missing ice hockey players for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior librarian, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon talked about how, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel spread among the community of slum shadows, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t arrive,” he said.
Thieves took 23,585.88 euros during the execution of the ATM at Newport on the Lavees
The thieves stole 23,585.88 euros from a Brink employee in Newport on the Levees ATM on Friday morning, Newport Police Department said in a statement.
The driver emptied the vending machine at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, writes a press release, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the thieves will be asked to contact Newport Police by phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes its new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when the change was announced on Twitter, the man wrote, “Engine Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her concert “a time of emotion,” said the author of the show.
In addition to being an acronym for the man’s current present name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” West said earlier, discussing the name of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is us.
I changed my name to Kanye, which means “this one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper playing with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used its name with and without a dash of thought, with large and small letters.
Mexican politician AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use an army against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that “never use an army to control Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people while the left-wing student movements were being held throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free state universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a generally official AI strategy.
At the same time, last year, China unveiled its plan to be a maker in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Redoubleling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won America’s best Othello player. Later, he was a member of the Microsoft Research Board and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
“U.S. scientists need to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“China is not the one who takes over the intellectuals; they are companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant researchers from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help the US support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published its next generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences distributes funding to people working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a unified Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it had started funding the $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation currently finances over $100 million a year in AI-related research.
At the same time, there has been no change in US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote to change country name in referendum
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from ratifying its membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a requirement for that territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries made an agreement in June on the new name of Macedonia, but nationalist opponents claim that the name would harm the national identity of the Slavs in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he was not going to take part in the referendum, and the campaign of non-compliance has raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% turnout rate required for the referendum.
The referendum asked: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in a statement.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of the Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no irregularities reported as of 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Macedonia’s capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote in the Macedonian referendum to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising a chair in front of the tents for those who would ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join up head-on, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and gain the integration of Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments in Macedonia at an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think a large majority supports changing the name because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
The results of a poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are planning to take part in the referendum, which is below the necessary electoral turnout.
A poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
Failing a referendum would be the first serious blow to the government’s Western policy after the government took over in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes for the goal through Brighton's defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's defenses, securing Manchester City 2–0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his gate hit in the 65th minute of the game came in ridiculously easy.
Argentinian attacker passed the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders before he reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the border with Brighton's penalty area.
Then he threw the ball to the left of himself, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the net.
“Aguerol has problems with the feet,” said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
“We told him he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the gate at the time.”
However, Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial lead in the Premier League fight.
The gate was struck in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in this game clearly in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball beautifully to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling further.
The Sky Blues created the ball into the net just before it slipped out of the bounds.
Manchester City will play for Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a joy-breaker against Rockies
When the Nationals were away from the finals, there was no reason for a new start.
Scherzer hopes to make Colorado Rockies land on Sunday, but only if Rockiesel, who runs the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in NL West, has a chance to make it to the final.
Rockies guaranteed at least 5–2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing with this audience and another team in the atmosphere in Denver is probably at a higher level than any other game I could expect this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have not yet named an opening player on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined towards Scherzer’s food in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be 34th feeding, made a warm-up session on Thursday and fed on Sunday as usual.
This right-handed Washington player is led by 18-7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks 300 and the favorable odds of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump calls for a rally in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event in which I don’t run, but I’m actually running. That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible extremist group of democrats, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means. You will see their wickedness and dirty game.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything and we don’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “stand up and stop.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wrong, wicked, vile, and false.”
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who shouted loudly at the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Ee, ah, what?
No, no, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a big union.
It is unacceptable to those who express their opinion.
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour MEPs to be told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing my opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because he was strongly opposed to Judaism.
In my case, the convicts condemned me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues, on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party’s statement stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, my eight-year experience as a local Labour Member with Friday evening meetings is exactly that.
As of today, unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most meetings, and the promise to be “be kinder and kinder” in politics has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different viewpoints are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged who is acceptable to the party board.
The co-worker with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would otherwise never agree with, whether national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I stand up in public, no matter what I am actually talking about, it will be followed by condemnation on social media, inciting my recall, ignoring party politics and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
This is not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow workers, because the comments that I am addressing are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those of my fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views of this policy area is how abuse levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association, and every initiative of “incredulity” or amendment of electoral rules will make the party narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “then everything will be fine.”
But I didn’t have to do that in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the carelessness of the Thatcher government, which had literally left my large school classroom on the brink of collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services for those who need it most, acting both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
It is by no means possible that anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is meant for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting for what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have tilted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully fun Tennessee first league game.
They are now the only unbeaten team in the top ten of the table.
Finally, it was a high level of team protection and better risk taking, which led to home team victory and coach Peter Murchiel has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “I respect Ayr, they used their options better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute of the game, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over by Warriors, gave Melros a chance to make Jason Baggot a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's headland with a penalty strike just before the end of the half-time, reaching position 17-5 in favour of Ayr at the end of the half-time with a single event.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which took over Baggo, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken off the stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr further increased his head start thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt, which was broadcast by Climo.
Ayr's chief executive, Blair Macpherson, was then on a yellow card, but again Melrose's player Bruce Colvine's attempt to broadcast failed after intense pressure.
However, the home field team gained strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to stop Climo from hitting the line without a ball, MacPherson put the ball down behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed the ball on, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe tried to cast David Armstrong and sent the side guard Gregor Henry away on the fifth attempt of a team playing on the home field.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to step into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named director of a recognized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC television series he writes and plays alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming season of the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan will make a living after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to step into Glasgow’s “a thriving restaurant business.”
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a sea border hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean again
Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags fly over the official buildings.
For naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, there is a slogan: “The sea is our right.
Restoring it is our duty.”
In Bolivia, completely without sea borders, the memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, is still alive. The same vivid is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of momentum, unity and calm, and the country is naturally looking forward to a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A large number of Bolivians from all over the country look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of intermittent discussions in order to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, is at stake by Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no power to give up the territory of Chile and has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
Just six months after hearing the final statements, the decision of the International Court of Justice indicates that this was not a “complex case,” said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And further away from the further causes of Bolivia, the past four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of sea access has been abducted by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zarate said.
Morales’ warlike beauty speech has lost all of Chile’s remaining goodwill, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s ruling was unnecessarily urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most famous presidents of Latin America, uses the sea issue to express political resentment.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not be released until the U.S. can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by its competitors’ leaders at the Singapore Summit.
He comments at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be re-starting a nuclear diplomacy impasse more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
According to Ri, these are air castles, according to which the U.S. continues its restrictions and refusal to declare war on Korea will cause North Korea to give up.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards armaments.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, scepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the weapons that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Nights bring a series of massive headgear to the viewer, brought to the shoppers on the shopping streets in their neighborhood
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage a series of bizarre super-large headgear that blinded the Paris Fashion Week during their 2019 summer season.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to fashion show.
Valentino's top work was an over-packed beige hat covering the heads of the models, decorated with a wide border resembling feathers.
Other super-large items of clothing included scarves adorned with jewels, a magic hat and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing so at exactly the right time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had folded mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high-end.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with air pipes and glasses, while the other one resembled a melted ice cream tube.
And if you continue with the giant moorings, you're lucky.
Moegurs predict that super-large headgear can also reach shopping streets near you.
The super-large hats immediately follow La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide straw hat seen in the heads of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created a largely impractical hat on social media, sent another great piece to the fashion fairs – a beach bag of straws that is almost as big as the model wearing bikinis.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffias and a white leather band was the top piece of the 2019 summer collection of Jacquemuse La Riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for super-large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence rankings and continued to do so in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and shared success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students study all over Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that is able to design and implement a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be well-known and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it will come to his mind.
When you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s recent exam results show that at the top of the tables there are languages with the highest rates of passing exams among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital life skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the subject options are in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find job vacancies, 17% of respondents said they lacked language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future work.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming indispensable in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choices made, acquiring a second language gives a person a real advantage in the future, as language skills are life-long.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of respondents do not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, the funding of language learning is important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A large number of schools tend to focus on classic modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that languages are crucial for the future of the country in a globalised business environment, which is why they must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Private schools continue to provide young Scots with choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Exciting admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in a pre-season opening game in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the number of play minutes still needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” Walton Lakers’ official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a numbered number of minutes.
After a training session last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games to warm up at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump’s West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first campaign event scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote will stand until Trump elects to be appointed to the free seat of the Supreme Court, he will seek to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control in Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s tonight campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 East Coast time.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump will probably talk to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh about this week's sessions, which became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while a Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main goal of the campaign series is to help gather new momentum for Republicans facing complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign manager said the aim of these five events next week was “to encourage volunteers and supporters when Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority of those in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Controlling Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump is heading for a fast election campaign season diving into as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said in a statement.
This evening’s campaign event, planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get a glimpse of the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
On Saturday, it’s the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican presidential candidate in West Virginia, who is leading the rankings based on polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team gets nervous about the competition, keeping hopes high before Sunday’s solo games
After three one-sided sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point of the pendulum is a perfectly fictional concept in sports, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where do they think is the turning point now?
“They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think it can be considered a turning point in a small way,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because four points are being managed and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don’t have enough wind to sail, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomase, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been a treadmill for both tii and grin and shows an example.
These shouts of victory from the throat became louder and louder with each round, overshadowing the defining putty that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were down with the two.
His putt, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's faith that the Americans are not yet out of the competition.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
This is the only thing that players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas after the last two days are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s strange but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the Bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into such a noisy crowd as back and forth reinforces the belief that the players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no player as far as Fleetwood or Molinar to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, the story of the glory of Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero of the morning, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the first nine dug a Spaniard and a Swedes into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out in August.
Four-balls and even games are extremely engaging to watch close-up just because of the interaction between couples, the advice given to each other, the advice not received, and the way the way can change in an instant.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and has taken the lead with a strong lead for the last day, but this session of the Quartet showed that the US team has a nerve to fight, in which some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe to lead the Ryder Cup on the last day 10–6
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a good lead, taking the lead in the United States from 10 to 6 after Saturday's four-balls and doubles.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinar led a two-winner struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the lost cup in Hazeltine, ruled the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance in the doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to maintain the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after a weekend like this, they are the second pair to win four points in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeauveel even more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a casual glow, but now lost his 29 four-balls and 19 doubles, winning seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who had retired in four-ball for the morning, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson to a doubles game, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the first and third place in the world rankings.
Europe did not succeed, although the race was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Triple-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points as a benchmark for Americans on Saturday.
They won a solid 2-1 victory in four-balls over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning the doubles Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, losing two openings.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going to singles games, although as owners, Furyki only needs a draw to preserve the cup.
While in second place for two days, after a Sunday counterattack, it seems like they won’t succeed.
North Korea says “no way” they won’t make themselves unarmed unilaterally due to lack of trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea has taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the United States responding,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security security, and in such circumstances, we are in no way willing to make ourselves one-sidedly disarmed first.”
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea will be rewarded when it takes step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the President of the United States and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards a “non-nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has called for an official end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a relaxation of the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The U.S. calls for a “first-ever nuclear non-proliferation” and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their goal forcibly, even against a declaration of end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that restrictions push us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions will exacerbate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between three Kim and South Korean leaders, Moon Jae-ini, during the last five months, and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, were one party to the nuclear disarmament issue, the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that turning to the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Wicked President” Trump called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but added that there is still much to be done and that restrictions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said he lacked a timetable for this, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s restrictions must continue vigorously and without failure until we can fully and definitively confirm the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an effort to prevent the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for “gangsterlike demands” in just a few hours.
North Korea promised to dismantle missiles and a nuclear complex at Moon’s meeting this month if the United States were to take “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that, under “appropriate measures,” he meant moving towards the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn How to Rest Enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture where caffeine rich people learn through night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academic excellence of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
According to Charles Czeisler, the designer of this course, a Harvard Medical School sleep doctor and Brigham and a professor at the Women’s Hospital, it is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired by the creation of the course after she gave a speech on the topic of how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told about this now, in my last year of school?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - it made me a cardboard box," he told Telegraph.
The course, which came for the first time in the study programme this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the University, said the university decided to take a course in the study plan after it was found that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the working week.
The one-hour course covers a number of interactions.
Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light on how sleep deprivation affects athletic outcomes and the importance of the practice of sleeping.
The second part explains to participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, along with the interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily established practice.
“We know this doesn’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, there is still pride in night learning marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring sufficient quality sleep time should be the student’s “stealing rod” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps to fight weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger state, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, having attended one of his classes in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a cross-campus course.
As a next step, he wants all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for both sleeping and waking, and to be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting caused by “blue light” as it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gate defeated Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bad guest game result when Dolly Menga's shot, sent from the side by Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 win to Livingston.
The Ibrox side was hoping to win their first guest victory since February, when they defeated 4-1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, leaving eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's head of Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before the semifinals, and the Rangers' poor readiness could not recover from it.
The Rangers are therefore in sixth place, Livingston is in third place, down to Hibernian with only one goal.
For Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, because their attacker Calum Spence needed a head wound treatment after he was hit with an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that led to the Ayr and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, however, went on to do the same with Liv 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been happy with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored the goal already in the second opening minute, when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half-guard didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-angled punch in the back of the post.
Rangers did gain control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player’s complaint.
The Rangers managed to score only two hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's main strike or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While Liv’s 34th minute release may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Once again, the Rangers could not contain Jacobs' deep heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball with Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted in a break, switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent. This shift almost paid off when the edge player split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits those where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow hit him from a corner with a big arch.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again applied for a penalty strike when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and READING ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From this science base, Geiger's counter became the basis of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Watches, where the main roles were seemingly improbable to cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear the nucleus of atoms emitted from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Don’t say it’s going to pop!”
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which bears his name, continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” traitor cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” traitor cells and kill them
The vaccine will teach the immune system to know as part of the treatment of fraudulent cells
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing these cells in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein common to many cancers and are injected back into the body.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine to teach the immune system to detect fraudulent cells disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers, and then they are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our findings show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of many types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach in which patients are taken into immune cells and trained to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with a supporting tribe of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat on the SNL live show.
It didn't go very well.
You will receive a whistle-blower in the Saturday Night Live studio towards Kanye West, after his confusing speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same post in 2020.
After his third song that night, which was named Ghost Town, and where he wore a hat with the letter Make America Great, he started to fight back against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
While this episode didn’t go live, West’s loudspeakers were uploaded to comedian Chris Rock’s social media.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West's post.
West also complained to the audience that he had quite a hard time behind the scenes with his hat.
“They were laughing at me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there, hat on my head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowned in a place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His comments fired the audience at least twice and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person published: “The whole studio remained in a state of death.”
West was on the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, because the singer’s ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the song "I Love It", which, at the time of the performance, he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one brave soul: TODAY, YOU PUBLISHED A REPRESENTATION TO LOVE.”
But the host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “who it is, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to honor (by buying my music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who, in my opinion, believes and disseminates a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he is now “former Kanye West.”
She is not the first singer to change her performer name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly divorced music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Belfast restaurant stabbing murder trial charge
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by a public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington does not approve of the masculinity of the trophy
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role as Jon Snowina HBO in the violent medieval fantasy series Troon.
But the actor (31) puts down the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be harsh.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) of the Troons, admitted that he felt “strongly” that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly that we’ve gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of the masculinity of the fan, because it shows superhuman characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be exactly what they want to be when they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
“Something has obviously gone wrong for the young.”
In a poll, he also admitted that after the end of the series the next summer, he would never take part in any of the Troon games, saying that he was “on the same side with his battlefields and horses.”
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard has been involved in the resurrecting of True West, a story about the filmmaker and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing about the game of the Troons.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the beloved character of Kiti's character Jon Snow in the award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased exponentially to 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been caused by sex, thus changing the past.
HIV has spread in some parts of China via infected blood transfusions .
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are related to insufficient sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking the GOP senator’s data, saying it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. Senators to the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by the “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Wrongs, lies, and even more detestable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The published information allegedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both of Utah).
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-minded websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to Waters’ office and provided information about the members of a Waters employee, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are compromised because of their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly evaluated on the Internet, including one by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial comes from anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has a feeling that is not appropriate for a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They need to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important when it comes to the truth,” he said.
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about their fraudulent allegations.”
“We will do everything we can to find out who the criminals are,” he continued, “and to make them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The Spy Parade of the Underarmed Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to seek Brexit in all new British films, and it seems particularly appropriate in Johnny English’s comedy parody series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Is it humorous to joke about how obviously stupid we are in the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, who is incompetent with a rubber-eyed face, has been given permission to do things again in his paw-like way - and that this wide comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is a secret agent who, despite his bizarrely pretentious smoothie-glamour, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little character who gave the tone to Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also based on the traveler and the internationally mysterious Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which left only chaos behind.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this last J.E. movie.
I liked the approach to Johnny English's helicopter when he wore a medieval armor and he wore a helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s talent for making a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer a self-confident comedy.
This humor seems to be more for children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s cunning adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s dark films Beanina.
There is an eternally current assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has penetrated Britain’s highly secretive online network of spies, exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thereby creating a great disappointment for the local agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and struggling character who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character perfectly, but there is not much in the manuscript to work on.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English will be flown back to Whitehall for emergency information and reunited with his former longtime partner Bough, who will be played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the shame of his Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kur<0xC3><0xB5>lenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerously charismatic tech-billionaire paw, who claims to be able to solve all the British computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their wild odyssey: hiding themselves as waitresses, they put a fire on a French restaurant; they create chaos, secretly restraining Volta’s luxury yacht aboard; and English initiates a genuine disorder when she tries to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta’s house.
This last section does not use any brakes, but as cute and tempestuous as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV make-up attached to it.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I caught myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party denies drawing up a plan where Britons work four days a week, but are paid five days a week
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has considered a pivotal plan that foresees the British working four days a week, but will be paid five days a week.
The party wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to the employees, giving them one additional day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend — but they would get the same salary.
According to the source, this idea would fit in with the party's economic agenda and so the state is going to be biased in favour of the workers.
Thursday’s working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that employees can take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the draft review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but Thursday’s working week is an effort that matches the party’s approach to balancing the economy, both for the benefit of workers and for the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “Four days of working week are not party politics, and the party does not discuss it.”
Vice-Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to withdraw power from the “showed leaders” and “profit-earners” of utilities.
The plans of the Vice-Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain their full participation, because the Labour Party could make “deductions” in connection with perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of private equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes to see if FBI Kavanaugh's investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the Bureau could influence the termination of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, co-host Scott Pelley of Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the hearing, and I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, firm, and unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be bald.
“I am confident in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and it can only be changed in a bombshell,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all whom he called could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music event with a tremendously impressive audience of celebrities and an equally impressive goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival now sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn not only enjoying such singers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true goal of the event, the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers that hopes to end poverty, constantly increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if they have 12 more years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action or is it just another click trick where people feel they are doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters in an effort to achieve a number of different goals.
According to the report, these measures have helped world leaders to inform about the commitments and policies of more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-implementation partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “helping children make full use of all their abilities,” promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historic footnote to social injustice,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 activities calling for improvements in maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project called The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
In response to one FAQ on its website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult path – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements we face, we are confident of our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers who will perform at this year's event in New York City, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval “block” to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its naval force if necessary to prevent the capture of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s participation in Syria, especially if it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to transfer energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has this opportunity, with the help of our navy, to ensure that maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement had been turned over to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, boosting and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to expel the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “capture” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been repulsed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president in midterm elections.
At the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and that includes the first lady,” she said.
“After November 6, I am seriously considering running for president.”
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump’s actions at the Town Hall, saying he “takes the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m seriously worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and its Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Friday: “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think he should run for office in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters thought the senator shouldn’t run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a proposal.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported the possible application, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it will officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruiting from Iraq in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are going to return to,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of his son “an elephant in the room” and, in connection with his son and other war veterans, said that “they will come back a little differently, they will come back with punishment, they will come back wondering if there is enough respect for what has been given to the state by soldiers and pilots and all other military personnel.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, interference in a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon in a drunken state.
18 states and the District of Columbia contest new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and regions issued a brief statement in Washington, D.C., on Friday to support the challenging policy of the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been published.
The woman said her accomplice “and her violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence in order to apply for asylum.
Prosecutor General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “disapproves state, union and international law for decades.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle,” the court said in a brief statement.
Lawyers also said in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the United States would harm the U.S. economy, saying they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “demand the necessary workforce.”
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The purpose of the shelter was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her fever at the evacuation center of the town of Palu, who was sacked with a baby boy.
“Every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There is not enough clean water.”
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out the broken things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder pain, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
The tears filled his eyes as he recalled how a strong earthquake shook his fifth-floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“I had time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are not in danger.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “bullying with advertising”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement under U.S. daily news about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state's largest-selling newspaper - after China was accused of interfering in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what U.S. officials described as a new phase in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
China’s countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa because they supported Trump’s Republican parties, experts from China and the US have explained.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China’s largest agricultural exporter Terry Branstad, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article by Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing advocacy ads in our free press.”
“In spreading our propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s precious freedom of expression and the practice of free journalism, putting its paid advertising on Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in Beijing’s street kiosk and there are no real differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans will alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute attempt to investigate the FBI was sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday—they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” senior adviser and state representative Karine Jean-Pierre told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated “November is coming!” at a demonstration in their Senate corridor, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to move on to Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic Indulge and internal bias are going to get out of the schedule,” unofficial political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among the female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters aged 18-29, who often do not like the president and do not vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans confirmed they would move forward.
“This has become very confusing for the GOP,” former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put in office, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve treated him,” U.S. leader Guy Cecil said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided who believe in Ford and Kavanaugh after the testimonies, but with a little more support for the first.
YouGov’s new survey showed that 41% of respondents believed in or likely believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Last week, Ford swore to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web’s inventor plans to launch a new internet with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched an initiative to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company that builds Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an extraordinary interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “to rule the world.”
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal online database” or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all available in one browser at the same time.
Its personal online data collection makes it unique that the user can choose who can access this information.
The company calls it “personal authorisation through data”.
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to bring resources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-purchased security platform, some developers hired to work on a contract project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change once all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published in the Media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the memorial stone of a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church in England to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought his honor on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglis and Leaucourt.
However, he died four days later through a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons opened the memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genetically symbolic” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning fight.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, “through a very thick fog and gunfire bullet hole.”
Later, he rushed to the assault line and carried it forward with “the greatest galacticity” before rushing alone to one of the machine gunners and knocking out three opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when there was only a little over a month left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I am always grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood’s rival youth band.
Michael Vann said he had “a very great honour to participate in this parade,” adding that “the presence and support of so many people shows that the true hero is appreciated.”
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but they only saw Pigtail Peppa
Imagine that you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, but this main event won’t be shown to you.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six main cards, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night long.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were left with their mouth shut because of the appearance of Peppa on the screen.
Many were not enthusiastic about it, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see this struggle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to children’s comics as “some kind of sick joke.”
“It’s government regulation that at 6:00 a.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellatori’s senior vice president for marketing and communications when asked about the transfer.
"The Pigeon Peppa," yes.
Bellatori’s president Scott Coker said they plan to work on their schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about replaying now, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. Sunday morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn’t, it was the government’s rule.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We show a reference - as we usually do - instead of six fights, we tried to offer more to the fans, and we just went over time.
This is a terrible situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels “Undervalued” About Sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic diver, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone is not like him.”
While attending Lauren Laverne Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Also, becoming a parent changed his attitude toward winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was not so important anymore.
You can get a regular long-term broadcaster Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to his illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley told me that she felt less valuable as she grew up than the others, because it wasn't socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings that I am not worthy and feel different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" worth, and did not disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double bronze Olympic champion has become the leader of the highly respected LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he talks about it because he is lucky that he can live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "said to him as a surprise."
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “total outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Father, you can’t sit in the front row because by then you’ll be gone,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually finished breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving into the home crowd in front of the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling about it,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympics and still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was removed from the game at Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday doubles game and four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, a five-time winner split his day into two, being a cheerleader and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct striker, not even at the peak of his career, is a 48-year-old particularly suited to play in a narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long rough course punishes constantly lost blows.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinar in his ninth race, who has joined forces with the novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If the Americans, who are behind 12 singles at the beginning of the game with four points, start out fiercely, the Mickelson race can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he had nothing else to add.
“He fully understood his part today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He is a celebrity and has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but it went like this, and we had to choose such a path.
He wants to be outside, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday as the most played player in Ryder Cup games.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional mental contribution.
“He’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
He offers much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup’s great lead at the beginning of single games can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Danish made a public appearance at the 1997 Valderrama competition, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, a five-point lead was held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the finish line, it had declined dramatically, winning only a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 : 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You even remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very little,” said Bjorn in the picture after the 5:3 win at Class of 2018 on Friday and yesterday’s 10:6 at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points written down.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we focus on it.
I’ve always said, I’m focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who our opponents are – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush into things.
Tomorrow there will be completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow I will read about my personal performance, and so it’s something else.
It’s nice to be with a opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you need to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, you have to go and do it yourself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes his players will act better personally than with the other players except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's winning team, before becoming a part of the defeat when Europe defeated the "Medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything in their game on the last day.
“We will have 12 important games tomorrow, but you will have to start fiercely, like in Brookline and like in Medina.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the average races.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the pitch in a way that makes us feel like this is going to be a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the race, and he is facing the best of the best against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in that order because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of single games.
Germany's new warship is back on track
The latest high-speed German navy ship should have come into service in 2014, replacing the old Cold War war warships, but this will not happen until the next year due to faulty systems and the increased costs of snowballs, local media reported.
The introduction of the new Rheinland-Pfalz high-speed cruise ship of the Baden-Wurttemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transfer problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are replaced by obsolete Bremen class cruise ships.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealing technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sails should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, persistent delays mean that high-end warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
A failed F125 cruise ship appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after it was received.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important “software and hardware shortages” that made the warship unusable if it had been used in a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships are managed by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the senior Bremen class's high-speed crew.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to incorporate future innovations.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, which weighs 7,000 tons, is probably twice as heavy as the class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It has been said that it amounts to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the newer high-speed jets are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the capacity of the German navy will be reduced.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the navy had actually “run out of ready-to-go ships.”
The official said that this topic has grown over time as a snowball because the old ships were removed, but the replacement ships did not come.
He regretted that none of the speedboats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
A study by researchers at the National Trust in Scotland tracks traditional soprano peppers in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-tailed and Daubenton leather mice.
Special recorders are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field research using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of the call of bats and the activity of the species.
Then a habitat map and report are created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the mortality rate of bats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical processing of some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Skin mice aren't really blind.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, reviews and sometimes even save.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only special bat reserve in the area of Threeve in Dumfrie and Galloways, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
“In Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still much to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need.”
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance on the property, as the unintended destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Skin mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them.
Scottish officer Elisabeth Ferrell has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected allegations of rape against him as an “insolence” by saying that people “want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She has reportedly paid a woman €330,643.10 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
Referring to the Instagram live video of its 142 million followers after hours of accusations, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “disgusting news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
"What we said today is a fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a lucky man and I’m fine,” the player smiled.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel in connection with “the disclosure of an unacceptable suspicion of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral harm corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor reportedly went back to the player’s hotel room, where he allegedly was raped, according to documents filed by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good man,” of whom “one percent fail.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple’s sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an extra-judicial solution because he was afraid of “cash” and was concerned about “public humiliation.”
Now, a 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution, as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved the giant Juve to Italy for a transaction of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK could regret car manufacturers leaving forever
The United Kingdom would “twelve this forever” if it lost its position as the world’s automotive leader after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would be temporarily suspended at a manufacturing plant near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossings without Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avens, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the production process at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without an agreement, with concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
Toyota’s production line works as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement reached on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store more than a day’s supply at its Derbyshire plant, so production has to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future EU relations was “exactly calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution that will allow what we want, and not only to take advantage of the current success, but to take full advantage of the opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain package.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, a representative of Unite’s trade union, who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From our own experience we know that if jobs disappear, they will not return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed by another week as the fight against Brett Kavanaugh, the highest-ranking candidate, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein follows the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who investigates the interference in the Russian elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy general prosecutor and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence, has sparked rumours in Washington for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of interception devices to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want Rosenstein to be fired, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a collision with an interrogation of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave sensitivities.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep the press informed, as always.”
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information hours was not a result of deliberately disillusioning TV journalists, although he added: “I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president will do more questions and answers than any president before him,” he said without adding evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen how we’ve done it over the last few weeks, so it’s happening during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated, perhaps, why, before gathering in front of journalists, he was on the loose and sometimes in a strange appearance.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter, with the UK leaving the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs related to the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued on the way towards the decisions expected for this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie performed an emergency surgery after Saturday's head injury and defeat 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the season.
“He fell sideways and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen while on the sidewalk before he was placed on the stretcher to be taken for further inspection from the field.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no details yet on the type/range of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, was in his first season in Tennessee State after his arrival from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help the homeless on the basis of new Tory plans
This step undermines Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Temple tax is levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes it will create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax rate if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
Movement is considered an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The temple tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, directing additional money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The additional fee - which is in addition to this temple tax, including the higher levels set two years ago for the second home and re-scheduled purchases - can be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when buying housing.
Many of the country’s prosperous regions – especially in the capital – have become “climbing cities” thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will come just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high if they buy land but don’t use it, and urged May to abandon affordable house quotas to improve Britain’s “housing shame.”
Corbyn has announced a reform of the eye-catching housing economy, including rent control and ending the nuisance of innocent people.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised that as Prime Minister I would commit to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is not right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, have the same ease of buying homes as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland.”
Jack Ross, Sunderlan’s chief executive, says his “final goal” is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish (42) is delighted with the challenge of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached Class B and that was the limit,” Ross told the BBC’s Scotland show Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in Hampden, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come when I am successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear for such big and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success is when I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Champions League,” he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I only see myself as a success if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, having previously been Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts’ senior staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third level and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academicis.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled when he took over Alloa.
“I truly believed that leadership was more appropriate for me than to play.
It seems strange because I managed, got a reasonable income and enjoyed some peak moments.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still experience it with the stress and pressure of my work, but management just seems more correct.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable now than ever before in adulthood.”

According to the study, the best time for a pint is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of pubs in British trouble, but more pressure has been put on restaurant labels.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, representative of CGA: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June when the turnover of pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants went even harder.
In June, the decline of 1.8% in restaurant trade deteriorated even further in July.
Drinks-based pubs and bars trade the most successfully and the restaurants that try to please the least.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurantkeepers.
Apparently, people just wanted to go out and drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month, while the sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant labels continue to fight, although the decrease in sales of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businessmen, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some necessary relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand-related institutions.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 groups of activities with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion and is a benchmark for the established industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some of whom are 11 years old, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasists found the growth of the leaves of the “lost Insta”
News Raises Fear of Posting Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic account” to show their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create secret social media accounts they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 gymnasists found a significant increase in “taken Insta” accounts (reference to the image sharing page on Instagram).
The news raised fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic account” designed to show parents and made acceptable to themselves.
One of the discoverers of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret newspaper found that a teenager invited others to rape him.
The Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured into creating accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes a spokesperson for athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most respected athleticist, and Chairman Ian Beattie described what has happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting him to lead,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
An American who won four gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres and now shares his opinion frequently on the BBC was unable to walk after a transient ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I recover and if, to what extent, only time will tell.
I’ve worked hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertising, which compares breastfeeding mothers with milking cows.
To celebrate the presentation of the “world’s first silent-wearing breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer-oriented technology company, published an ironic music video-like advertisement to showcase the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
The four real mothers dance with the cows in the barn filled with hay and sing: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
The verse repeats: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has generated contrasting opinions on the Internet.
Video viewers with 77,000 views and thousands of comments disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the backs of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that they steal children from them within days of birth.”

Another commenter said: “Consciously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of mothers who keep them?"
Someone added: “It’s a totally inconspicuous advertisement.”
Part of it's for advertising, and one woman thought the story was overjoyed.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping my milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but let's take it as it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” wrote one.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement (often in their workplaces or toilets) for mothers who pump themselves and feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they have all danced in bras with non-observable pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women who pump breast milk feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes, and does not stand out from the breastfeeding brace, giving women the freedom to move, keep children, and even walk outdoors while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritating introduction.
With a comparison of female expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar key an extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This is not the first time the news has covered the Elvie pump.
At the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children, the designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the stage.
Thousands of children of migrants quietly went to the tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children in custody has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult with the help of sponsors for the establishment of children.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents, and they are afraid of violating the possibility of staying in their country, for this they require the right of custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other domestic adults could provide fingerprints and data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, admitted to Congress that the agency had arrested a dozen people who requested financial support for non-attached minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ household members are illegally staying in the country and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So we will continue to track them," Mr. Albence said.
In order to deal more quickly with children, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested.
Many defend their legal content before the immigration judge by videoconference, so as not to come.
Unfit for release is quickly expelled from the country.
According to the asylum workers, and based on reports published in recent months, the longer the child stays in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulty may be caught by two eyes due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to a tent city without leaving enough time to get used to the feeling or say goodbye to friends could create a trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to come home to the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegally under the pretext of countering terrorism and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the assembly.
Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy war until we have cleared the entire area of Syria” from both terrorist groups and “any foreign force that is illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he blamed the incomprehensible fears that prevent the arrival of refugees for spreading part of the western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them look after them,” he said.
“They are politicizing something that is merely a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is no end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create the last rebel base in the Idlib buffer zone, has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread invasion of the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would hit the Nusra Front fighters linked to jihadists, including Al-Qaeda, who would be "defeated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to persuade the new Committee of Government and Opposition Members to plan the post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for the election soon with the first meetings.
Moualem called for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if the dismissal and scandal had not previously ended his presidency, as is likely to be desired by liberal viewers.
Which, of course, would be the “most exciting end of the presidency.”
Currently, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hourly ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” 3.5 million cable has kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“It’s the tension we’re involved in because we don’t understand it,” ABC’s head of the drama “Designated Survivor” said about the secretary of government, who will become president if the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, has another theory.
He remembers a pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The leader told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said he was making me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not as shown on television, rumours in Washington may be fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and to the families and the global economy of immigrants who want to reunite.
Staying away from the subject is only the luxury of the privileged viewer.
But a six-hour expert talk show about Bob Woodward’s “deep background study” for his book “Fear” and Paul Manafort’s $13,225,73-paying jaana cowhide Bomber jacket (Washington Post said about it in a “high self-confidence inflatable garment”), and Stormy Daniels’ pursuits regarding Mr. Trump.
I will never watch Super Mario again.
“One of his activities, which may seem like a reality show, is that he shares something every night,” said Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO Brent Montgomery Trump, the creator of the show “The Panther Kings” with the passing actors and the props of the day’s plan (still nominating with the NFL, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't miss a single episode or you're out of time.
This week, when he met Fleiss, his home on the north bank of Kauai was 80 degrees warm, but he had crawled into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not give up watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Legal Committee and how the Supreme Court’s fate hangs on his hair.
“I remember how we did all kinds of crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money flows are moving elsewhere to the most acute White House mid-term election
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania’s 17th division receives a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of the congress district, receiving two dominant companies in the same place.
This led to the re-election of the forehead of the Pittsburgh division from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second division last spring in extraordinary elections.
Lamb’s opponent is Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the previous 12th division of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January, making the old districts divided into non-constitutional electoral districts, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have unleashed a campaign in which financial departments of the largest political parties beat themselves with money - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a snap victory in the much-watched March 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District emergency elections.
A Republican has been around for decades and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the region.
Political opinion-makers have given the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback to Washington.
Mr. Trump met with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere and owned a Panama hotel until partners threw out the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama decided to recall American leaders for a diplomatic mission, as ministry spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, was to be punished, including for drug surveillance, development and economic stimulus.
The penalties proposed, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a continuation of a similar meeting last year that was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and end the debate on any El Salvador punishments.
Diplomats say Vice-President Mike Pence will now be evaluated, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the positions of the government.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of what had been said by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates on the need to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke about the need to remain anonymous.
Study history
Next, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump’s possible administration of justice, on which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is related to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report to this institution as if he were going to speak again to the electorate and perhaps even to his peers.
There are a lot of aggressors here, and I do not want to point out that it is inevitable that Trump or his European counterparts should be expelled.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West would have stopped him and supported Czechoslovakia in M<0xC3><0xBC>nich.
We were upset and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-year killings.
History revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What will we do if Trump launches Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that he made a proposal last year for a secret recording of the president and speculated on his incompatibility with that position.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term elections if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter holiday.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once took over and used our embassy home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me a tail of candlelight on a table with a hammer.
With such a legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will organize Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which followed earlier this month an impressive match against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become a Group G of the European League.
Knee injury did not allow central player Graham Dorrans to play the game against Villarreal before the first appearance of the season in 2 :2 draws, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something, and we left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was usually a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but because the people support us, then I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, thanks to this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good sense of guts.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the previous season behind and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
But this should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare for the care of your family if they do not know your wishes beforehand.
Collaborate with your advisor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financial insurance policy to help cover these costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the money you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles from the very beginning.
Worry about your health care credentials to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will follow your wishes at a time when you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee in relation to your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so that you are ready if necessary.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place.”
Men were shot several times in Ilfracombe
The men were shot several times with an air rifle when they were on their way home after a night out.
In the '40s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the shooting at about 2:30 p.m. as a random act.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the link has been broken, the rescuers have received no information from the Donggala Regency north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala regents is an area that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The number of residents of the Regent, which is an administrative region under the jurisdiction of the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morawal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit Indonesia's most populated Java island south, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province, was hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Sumatra's islands - the island of Mentawa, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's Regent Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person tried to inform the police about alleged crimes, Palin took a phone call from her.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su's investigation facility and is being held against a $500 unsecured bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was “not guilty under any circumstances,” the news network said in a statement.
Palin faces three A-class misdemeanors, which means he can be expected to face up to a year’s imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanour punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, the police summoned his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference in a domestic violence crime report and possession of a weapon, all in a drunken state.
His girlfriend said he punched him in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palini in 2016 when she tied her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, a result of her service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake followed by tsunami: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the edge of Sulawesi city centre, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social media, videos show the moment of an earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the shores of the city of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors apply for a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having been killed in a terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people. This rare sentence has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, both pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to a death penalty application in the southern area of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm.
In both cases, court documents indicate a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury brought a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight murder charges, along with extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors for organised criminal offences, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s actions as “horrible, cruel, and detestable.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
The five victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death of the New York South District Court.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple was executed after conviction in a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, an indigenous Uzbek, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
The police said he had told the investigators he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to carry out ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
Police said he also wanted to display the flag of ISIS in his hospital.
In a 22-point indictment, he has not accepted the guilt.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defence counsels, said they were “clearly disappointed” in the ruling.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty will prolong the trauma of all those involved instead of the life sentence that accepts the guilt without the possibility of release,” Patton said.
Previously, the Saipov Defence Team asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
According to Tory, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army” during today’s Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to feel the “hotness” of Eurosceptics because one of Theresa May’s own parliament members recommended that they lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative deputy of the House of Commons, said on March 4 in Birmingham that the UK would “be out now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
However, Mrs May is facing the problem of reconciling her deeply divided lines, which was stressed by conservatives in favor of staying in town, joining her anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track among the supporters of Brexit, the remnants and the EU attacks.
The Allies called for a continuation of the deal with Brussels, despite a counter-attack, and for the Eurosceptic and liberals to choose between their package and "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted “to give up the Chequers plan.”
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"It's his responsibility that we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: “I stand outside for Brexit, but we have to abandon Chequers’ plan.”
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory’s Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that politicians at the meeting should be made to feel “hot” when they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let that happen.’
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, on the verge of betraying Brexit, uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the national army of this country that gave us a victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the remains marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering held at the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved the slogans of “Tories Against Brexit” after setting up a group this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they had with their party's application when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who say that IT systems can be deployed and all the technology can be brought to Canada and more, to smooth border crossings, to cross-border unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete mess.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the West Massachusetts Town Hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for election in November against GOP’s state representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that in 2020 he might be in opposition to Trump.
Saturday afternoon’s event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall after Trump took office.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, that is, the forefather.”
LSU Sims shot in custody
LA Police in Baton Rouge said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference around 11 a.m.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help to identify the man in the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died in the wake of it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247 sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the previous season, 10 of them in the original set, with an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 boardballs per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after team record gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the order of the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position the first two times and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to boxing stops and left the Hamilton group behind in close traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing station later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead after being side by side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner side free after the third corner tried to protect it with double movement.
Max Verstappen started the competition at the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round for his 21-year birthday.
He then led the race most of the time, driving towards the finish line with the rubbers and passing Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, taking fourth place.
He eventually drove to the boxing station on the 44th lap, but failed to speed up in the last eight laps, which gave Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen a fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a good job all week and was a real gentleman passing me by.
“The team has done a great job of having one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday gathering for the incident that she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, but instead commented on what is happening in the Senate, which shows that people are “false, disgusting, and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is currently happening in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see anger and angry, mean, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer to the question, “Did you leak the document?”
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Wait a minute.
“We leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added with the senator’s face.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about Kavanaugh’s charges and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill said: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep the confidentiality, and according to his request, I did.”
But his denial did not suit the president, who commented on Saturday’s gathering: “You know, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see this evil and disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to drive over to gain power and control," the president of the media said.
League: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the Belfast Giants at the rematch of the Friday elite league on Saturday, losing to Dundee 5:3.
The Giants set out early to lead the game with two goals from the goal of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the Vikings before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee before the gates of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third loss for the men of the elite league Adam Keefe. They came to Belfast on Friday night to win Dundeed as of 2:1.
It was the fourth meeting of the half-season, of which the Giants won three previous games.
The opening gate of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauvilier was dubbing for the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan returned the home team in the first third of 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the gate in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured the Giants to lead before the first break, slamming the second goal at the end of the first third of the night.
On the home field, the players regrouped, and Bouchard put them back to the level, slamming the numerically overwhelming gate at 27:37 a minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second third of the game, securing a victory in the last third of their team's attack zone.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
A pilot dies to save hundreds of people from an earthquake
An Indonesian airliner was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom have been missing.
The area is plagued by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung's colleagues escaped from the fluctuating air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure a safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the same time on the runway.
He then jumped out of the tower thinking it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to another city's major hospital.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, before the helicopter reached Palus.
“We were extremely sad when we heard about it,” the spokesperson added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may increase to thousands, according to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said: “The number of deaths can increase because the bodies of many victims are still under the rubble and have not been saved.”
Six-metre waves devastated the city of Palu, where mass burial takes place on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency aid brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we can’t tell what they can find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work night and day to complete all the evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready for that?” said CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin airline claims one man has disappeared after a lagoon plane crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from a plane that sank safely, the airline now claims that one of the men was missing when the plane crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find a single male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to the passenger’s details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when landing at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was crossing the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying at very low altitudes.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in a belt-high water to an emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew were panicked and screaming and that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on a nearby well also helped rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares a schedule for the night that the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office closed a case on Saturday about a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence data as an expert observer.
He pointed out to the jury how he used cell phone calls to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night the girl died, which contradicted the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said Tellis "wrong because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before the girl died.
The phone records showed that the fuckers had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“She deleted the girl from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is planning to make its trial call on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is A Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to combat the negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from the very beginnings of solving its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently gained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York babysitter sues for racist message in a couple of lawsuits
New York City’s nanny sues for discriminatory dismissal after a couple of messages she received accidentally from her family, complaining that the nanny was “just another black man.”
Couples deny that they are racist compared to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her displeasure when she learned that Giselle Maurice was black when she first got to work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIII, SURVEILLANCE MUSTANICAL.”
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice after understanding her prodigy, claiming that their social nanny, an African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino in her place.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal he wants to receive every day for the next six months in the amount of $350, and for the same work he was initially hired to do but without a contract.
“I want to show them to look, so do,” he told The Post, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the claim that they were racist, saying that ending their employment relationship with Maurice was a reasonable act because they were afraid that after the girl was insulted, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” his wife Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you give your children to a man with whom you have been rude, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on, come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you go against someone like that?”
It’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are severely criticized for their behavior and thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born right after the book was adopted, said: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He said his father, inspired to write a children’s book about a little toy, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was due to his father’s death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and wasn’t a proud man,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling when your child achieves something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not exactly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When he landed, his daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they don’t think she’ll survive,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said my daughter would die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
See you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now all systems began to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I kept my head down and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadi on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Woman's Postcards Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who lost their loved one’s claws of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine.”
Despite this, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with himself.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her husband's mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or was depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It tears a wound into the whole family.
It's gonna rip us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair while the FBI begins an investigation
“I believed that if we actually got something he wanted — a limited time and scope study — we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “fall out” in the midst of a permanent blockage of partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate this?
Their reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6th. If Republicans do not do well as expected, they will be appalled in their intentions to become the leader of the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and secure Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of troops "decreases" under Kim's government
South Korean legislation has said the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Ministry of Harmonization, said that their number had declined last year compared to the 2011 troops (2706).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean servicemen have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest national border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China takes troops as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back home.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they promised to work in general towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for lack of progress in sanctions.
“Untrusted by the United States, our country lacks security, and in such circumstances we do not in any way agree to make ourselves unilaterally first-armed,” Ri told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was unfit to be a judge of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the opposition leader of the House of Representatives, called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said the man was temperamentally unfit to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi gave an opinion in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
“I inevitably noticed that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, while describing his family and high school years, he was almost screaming from time to time and was left speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the committee, calling the accusations against him the loss of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election as “a grotesque and coordinated reputation killing” organised by angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man did not qualify as a Supreme Court judge because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with their statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to dismiss him if Kavanaugh was confirmed if Democrats were to get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying so much – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he’s also not fit in the court where he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act (the Health Act – the translator’s note) or Roe v. Wade (the legal precedent for abortion – the translator’s note) because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“At the moment, there is no time for a hysterical tilted person to become a judge and wait for us to say whether it’s not nice,” Pelosi said.
Women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, an overwhelming hatred of months and years, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He went on to say: “I got help from a woman who was somewhere in the chair; she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was saying, ‘You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially accepted as the output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I found myself once crying with indescribable rage, when an older woman – a strict leader I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me from the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never show them how to cry,” he told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you’re sad and it gives them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, then congressman of the Democratic Party from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a hunt for Monkey Business, and the campaign ended, deeply annoyed Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was someone else to join.”
Someone said it's like "Snow White and Seven Thumbs."
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was late in raising money, and he vowed not to run if he didn’t get a total of two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave him only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he made a speech announcing that he would not launch an official campaign, feelings — gratitude to the people who supported him, irritation to the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to the voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism — were overcome by tears in his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the press’s reaction to him.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war can be beneficial for Beijing
The openings in the US-China trade war were discouraging, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the long-term gap between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning wave this year, imposing taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has responded the same way every time, most recently with tariffs ranging from five to ten percent to $60 billion in value for American goods.
China has vowed to let the U.S. respond by shot, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink soon.
To withdraw from Washington would mean surrendering to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing is doing its cards right, a trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that lead to the loss of control of the economy in another country is in fact much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by bystanders,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asian research at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready to Return Refugees
Syria says the country is ready to voluntarily return refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation is now more stable and secure in the country’s territory thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore normality to the devastated areas of terrorists.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country voluntarily to return to the country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was happy to accept aid to build a devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at Le Golf National Golf Course near Paris in France with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown once again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team received the 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had been in the middle of the entire tournament, took a lap on the par-3 track in 16 waters, handing over the victory to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shines in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have won the tournament in the current 1979 format with a result of 5 : 0 : 0.
For American Jordan Spieth, the result was 5&4 by Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranking Dane on the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, beat Ian Poulter with 2 and 1, who might have been the last to win the Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder's veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It’s a team spirit and I’m glad I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after Europe won.
He gives the torch to his compatriots Jon Rahm, who won 2&1 on Sunday in a single game with American golfer Tiger Woods.
“I am extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record career in the Ryder Cup in 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 Grand Prix titles, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team struggled to find fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by the team: “I’m proud of the guys, they were bleak.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a great job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to get your hat up.
We played better.”
New information on water blooms: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general decline in the concentration of flowering algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more fragility in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating declining concentrations.
The extent of the waterfall is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there have been fewer places than last week.
Waterslides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration in Pinellas County on the coast or on the high seas, Hillsborough County on the low to high seas, Manatee County on the background to high seas, Sarasota County on the coast and offshore on the background to high seas, Charlotte County on the background to medium seas, Lee County
The provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to receive reports of respiratory irritation.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in north-west Florida last week.
