Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were reluctant to propose that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm came after the Assembly was called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, the representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title can make them a laughingstock.
According to one Labour MP, his group is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words “Twp” and “Pwp”.
Not for the benefit of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple, and pwp means poop.
A spokesman for the Plaid party said the whole group was “unsatisfied” and therefore suggested alternatives.
A Conservative MP said his group was “open” to changing the name, but noted that MWP was just a jump from Muppet.
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as in Yorkshire English the letter "u", i.e. MWP is pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the draft law introducing the change of name is as follows: “The final decision regarding the addresses for the nomination of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members.”
The 2017 law governing the government of Wales allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member (Member of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
Members come up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the Commission’s structures.
Members will be able to make their final vote on the issue of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing the country’s name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to mark the end of a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also known as Macedonia.
Athens has long said that it is essentially a territorial claim under the name of its northern neighbour, and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO recruitment request.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the change of name and thus does not take part in it.
However, proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that they must make for their EU-NATO membership.
The Harlem churches were in a difficult situation, and the bells of St. Martin were also silenced.
“In the past, as I hear from the older ones, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“People are in a different kind of company these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the community lounges where people go every day.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of ecclesiastical wealth will not redeem the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be held back in the same place from which they started.”
And, he adds, residential buildings will be placed in the place of the churches, the community of which will also not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further delay the closing of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these homes will join the parish.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Temple in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
It was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin Church was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for his boycott of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street, or the business owners who refuse to sell black products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order a community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin’s Parish, proudly referred to the bell game as “the bells of the poor.”
In July, an expert who played the bell game said that the bell game was “a cultural heritage” and “an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world to be performed by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who turned 18 years ago to the greater bell game of the Riverside Temple.
Merriweather said that St. Martin did not sign anyone in his place.
In St. Martin, a complicated situation has emerged in recent months with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved partly by the secular leadership of the church and partly by the episcopal office.
In July, the governing body of the parish, the parish council, turned to the episcopal office in writing, objecting that the office would “transfer the costs” to the council, although the council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the parish complain of a lack of transparency around the office house.
Shark Attacks 13-Year-Old California Boy During Cancer Attack
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during a cancer attack on the opening day of the cancer season, Saturday in California.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed that a boy was screaming for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, "He bit me!
He bit me!”
“His shoulder was torn apart at the sternum,” Hammel said, describing what he saw when he reached the boy.
“I began to shout to everyone out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water,’” he added.
The boy was taken by air ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in a critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that it was not among the species that were dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's expands into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's expert would compete with sellers and big-sales-style pipe stalls with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its ever-increasing growth in the British beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in fashion and household goods sales, the chain is testing larger-scale piperesands in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will also appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the piper line is due to the fact that the stores are trying to recharge the previously occupied shelf surfaces of televisions, microwave ovens and household items in different ways.
Sainsbury's said it will double its offering to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is offering for the first time.
But previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be placed in a larger area on brand-specific stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also relaunches the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan – these are now being sought by more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop also tests its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the other opens in Birmingham's Selly Oak this year.
As online purchases spread and food shopping habits shift to small local trades, wholesalers need to make greater efforts to lure customers in.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to its mixed stores, as the store chain is trying to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened Argos classes in hundreds of stores, as well as some Habitat classes – a move that has had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the chain of stores to lift the wrinkles of the beauty and pharmaceutical classes has failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of the revenues of its department stores ended this.
The new strategy was born three years ago after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in its 281 store to Celesio, which operates the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by changing the look of our pipers.
In addition, we have also recruited qualified staff who will advise the interested.
Our range of brands serves every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location provide an alluring power that takes the shopping experience to a new level.”
Peter Jones "bombed" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, has left after television presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn 11 million important agreements on her lifestyle product distribution business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the True brand that sells homewear and accessories.
The companies of the two celebrities were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby pulled out the match at Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she left their promising lifestyle-based business at the last minute – to focus on her own extremely lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones “was a tramp” when television’s saviour, at Jones’s headquarters in Marlow (Buckinghamshire) on Tuesday, announced during a tense meeting that his new contracts totalling <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million had not left enough time to devote to their common brand, Truly, which was selling homewear and accessories.
The two celebrities had previously been compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and were expected to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island for a holiday home.
According to one source: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was supposed to deal with this in the long run, and that will give him a living over the next few decades.
Being out was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the start.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods for sale."
According to experts, the departure of this Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions thanks to the huge amounts of money invested in a range of pillows and candles, clothes and homewear, and possible slippages.
It can also mean the end of an old friendship.
For ten years, Dan Baldwin, a three-child presenter and husband, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product face and take over Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on what happened last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones’s] business.”
Hard words were spoken, "then we fell in love"
He joked about what kind of criticism the press would have for his statement, which some people might consider “unelected,” and for having said so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
Trump asked Trump in a funny “newsreader” voice.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
Kim would also like to meet for the second time after the first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed North Korea’s nuclear disarmament as a huge step forward.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been thwarted.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees it, the United States does not have a “appropriate response” to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions for pressure.
Trump said in a campaign speech that he was more optimistic about.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
We were supposed to be at war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost there.
But now the relationship between us is very good.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim were positive – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s not hard to behave in a self-important way, but now there’s not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, and only about two hundred people are standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Indonesia has hundreds of dead tsunamis and earthquakes on the island
Indonesia has refused to help international aid organizations after the earthquake in Lombok.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be evacuated, a national disaster has not been reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid.
“In a number of cases, it has been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the creation of a Paluba-spatial relief team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are currently carrying out an assessment of the situation in the country to see if international aid agencies are involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared for the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami resorts have been built in Aceh Province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
Although there was a tsunami signal in place, the apparent lack of a tsunami signaling siren system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster that required human life.
Transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best time.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has placed the development of Indonesia’s knock-on infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not saved money on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now facing budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president must also confront the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had died and tens of thousands had to be evacuated because of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell on each other in the streets with bush cutters, bows and arrows, as well as other armaments.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool has a huge equator goal against Chelsea
At the Premier League match in Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in the 89th minute with his goal, but they did not lose to Chelsea.
The team lost 0-1 when Sturridge received an injection from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea Gate.
He put the ball to the left and started a huge kick in the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high over the sixteenth and went towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally reached the net above the seeding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there’s always someone like Shaq playing the ball in advance, so I tried to put myself in the best position possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took it off, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led to 1-0 in the semifinals after the Belgian star, Eden Hazard, scored a goal in the 25th minute.
Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball with a corner to the blues, then managed to break off the midfielder and rush into Liverpool Square.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> took a quick turn and got the ball back on the midfield.
Then, with a beautiful handover, he started Hazard towards the sixteen.
Hazard ran the defense and finally sent the ball to the far corner of Liverpool's gate next to Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool will meet Naples at 3:00 on Wednesday afternoon in the Stadio San Paolo Arena in Naples as the next stop of the Champions League group matches.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London at the UEFA Europa League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami.
The number of Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency said on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and the six-meter-high tsunami waves that followed, several people were buried under the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu with a population of more than 380 thousand are covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in connection with a stabbing woman
The police launched an investigation into a murder case after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the people in the area to report if they see anything or are dead.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I still ask everyone who was in Birkenhead around John Street and may have seen or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask all taxi drivers, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to also contact us, because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends came to the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police are making a notification to the victim's relatives for the time being.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one could enter the building and leave.
When he found out what had happened, he could not speak.
The residents of the building were informed that it would take several hours for them to get back into the building.
One police officer told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
“That’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police microbuses were inside the cordon and an additional one was outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous 0800 555 111 and refer to the file on September 30, 247.
Cromwell statue is the latest victim of history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue could perhaps be a poetic truth, for which Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers destroyed England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with enthusiasm at the time.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "crazy," an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that, in the current debates on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue before Westminster Palace would eventually become a target.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of the image was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of Thomas, his ascendant in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning Cromwell depiction reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that many still believe must be celebrated today.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many people still consider him a defender of external pressure, which external pressure in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this picture is accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
But it is certainly certain that this conflict, which erupted in the middle of the 17th century, had an impact on the further development of the destiny of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And as Lord Protector, we should celebrate and commemorate his achievements.”
Killer pig injured Chinese farmer to death
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and injured a farmer on a market in southwestern China.
His last name was only found on a man identified as Yuan with a bloodthirsty scab next to a pig on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Kujzhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a breeding plant in Xining, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of J<0xC3><0xBC>nnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said that the mouth of the giant cannibal in the pig was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig marta really killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and torn apart,” said a relative named Wu by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to stop harming others while the police were investigating the tracks on the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the man’s death.
Although it is not common, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in Massachusetts and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales pushed a farmer to the tractor until the man’s wife was alerted.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually prone to attack, but can become aggressive by the taste of blood.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
“You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Heavy rains in the southwestern region of the United States following Hurricane Rosa
Hurricane Rosa is weakening, as predicted, as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck at 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone emerges over the Pacific Ocean, heading west towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, a tropical storm will flood the south-west of the United States with heavy tropical humidity.
The storm could bring up to 25 cm of rainfall to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity meeting with the approaching low-pressure masses will cause heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, precipitation of 3–10 cm can cause sudden floods, floods filled with debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can cause precipitation of between 5 and 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, precipitation is expected in some parts from 5 to 10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is especially not recommended to walk in the desert.
Due to heavy rains, canyons can turn into rushing rivers, and storms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and clouds of dust.
The upcoming low-pressure masses may occasionally cause severe rain on the coast of Southern California.
Rains of up to 1.5 cm are possible, which can lead to minor floods with debris and even slippery road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Tropical showers can be seen in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Mondays and Tuesdays the rain will cover a wider range of areas.
The heavy rain spreads to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as polar air masses cool down, but tropicals remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is about 10 degrees.
In the coming days, even the summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States, the weather is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the south of the Great Plain to parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
The long-term weather forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the highest-ranking judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate was not resolved, and broadcasters were forced to break the regular broadcast due to the last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona managed to get a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Courts Committee that he was 100 percent confident that Kavanaugh was arrested at a high school party at the time and tried to undress him.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
The testimonies were seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC viewers.
The numbers of other channels that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people who watch the shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many spectators are used to being either the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, which featured experts in support of Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day’s audition.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement saying that he would vote for Senator Kavanaugh, he was shown on CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as a crowd of protesters greeted him on an elevator trying to attend a court hearing.
For minutes, he stood eye-catching while the crowd scolded him, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“Here I am,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted, “You have the power to do what so many women don’t.”
Flake only said that his office issued a statement, and then, before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the committee hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, he was seen live hours later, as the committee votes on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be extended to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority called for.
Flake was convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and later other senators.
Flake's decision was correct because it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s accusations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political play
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, alongside May’s interview, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the idea of dealing with the customs of Britain and the EU is “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims at Louisiana State University (LSU).
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on charges of murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said in a statement.
The police released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and announced that Sims' glasses had fallen during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and they had Simpson's DNA on it, broadcast on the WAFP channel of the CBS network.
After Simpson was interrogated, police announced that the young man admitted to shooting Sims.
According to a report by Advocate, the bail was set at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge County coroner on Friday, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police for the help of the escaped criminal team, the state police forensics lab, the university police and the residents of the area in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “obliged and persistent work to find out the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a LSU basketball player.
Sims scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the news of Sims’ death had “slowed” and “shocked” the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like this will happen,” Wade said.
Volcanoes flooding Mexico City with ash
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After increasing volcanic activity in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash removals in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several grunts and quakes.
The pictures on the community portals in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, cover the windscreens of cars with a thin ash layer.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of Mexico’s capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico’s central region in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with the police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s divisive secession referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint dust at the storm police, so the streets crowded with tourists at other times were now covered with dense powder paint.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a rubber rod.
“We will not forget, we will not forgive” slogan-scanning pro-independence groupings and pro-unit protesters behind the slogan “Living Spain” faced each other for hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were arrested for minor injuries during the protests.
The tension continues to decline in the area of independence, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by the Catalan separatists in a referendum on 1 October.
The electorate voted with a huge majority in favour of secession, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting in polling stations with aggressive actions.
The pro-independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not end up on the regular route.
According to 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist demonstrations with his wife, there is no longer a chance for Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I have seen my parents take pleasure in voting for us, but now our case has been compromised,” he said.
Although the regional elections of December last year succeeded in achieving an important, even a narrow victory, it is difficult for the Catalan independence parties to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are waiting for the court to judge their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent proclamation of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police, the conflict was fired on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he says.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who has been awaiting pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for next year’s European Parliament elections.
“I can best reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents if I take part in the European elections as a candidate,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrest three men driving their car into a house
Police arrested 33, 34 and 39-year-old men who drove their cars to a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. in the British summer time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
They may have even fired a number on the car at a given moment.
Menga scored 1–0 on Livingston’s Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
Livingston, who got into the first class, was a big surprise to Rangers by adding Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been the coach of the ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference, as Gary Holt's team went to a dead race with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrards, therefore, remained without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they face the first-placed Hearts team, with eight points behind them.
Before that, however, the Rangers are expected to play a match against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its divisional defeat series to six victories, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet been out with the team.
Livingston has missed a number of situations in the face of an imprecise team of guests
Holt's team could have gotten the lead long before a single goal in the game, as their attacking game caused the Rangers little trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense of the opponent, but he pulled the attack too far, and Alan Lithgow's attempt proved broad after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's cross-legged ball in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure that they would be able to disturb the guests in fixed play situations.
The decisive goal was born out of exactly such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it and found it in the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers were in possession of the ball, but domestic defense remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly’s gate was barely compromised.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow lost his goal to another free kick from Livingston.
The cross-sectional balls entered Livingston’s sixteenth consecutive year, but the defenders avoided them every time. The attacking team did not receive two penalties: one for Halket’s entrance to Glenn Middleton as a substitute player, and the other for handing over.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Penomenal” game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni from Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston gave me a phenomenal performance, and he dropped the beards.
The players played excellently one by one, and they were past expectations.
The team members and their playing style have hardly changed since they came back to the top, but Holt’s efforts deserve a lot of recognition, as the coach has been very keen on the team since his arrival.
Several players have brought their best form.
The two team captains played a huge role with their well-organized defenses, and Menga was a regular upheaval between Connor Goldson and Joe Worthall.
The Rangers played without a vision.
As well as being well-known at times under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to bring it to that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the domestic defense once anyway – so the Rangers have to get together quickly as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found mixed reception in Cologne
A pleasant atmosphere and cheerfulness characterized the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s divisive visit to Germany to improve the relationship between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside of Turkey.
Police have banned the gathering of 25,000 people before the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters of the president have appeared to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including a number of Kurds, expressed their disapproval of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policy and the German government’s decision to accept the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations exemplify the divisive nature of the President’s policy, which some German citizens of Turkish origin celebrate as a hero, while others see it as an autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: hit by a bicycle car and lost his life
A cyclist lost his life when he collided with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic road in the south-eastern part of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the attackers tried to help the cyclist, but he died on the spot.
The collision took place just a few months after another biker hit-and-run hit on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
London police said police are still working to verify the identity of the man in order to inform relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus lanes make traffic more difficult, and the authorities advise that motorists should avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison guards injured in a riot
Six inmates were injured during riots in a heavily guarded man’s prison, the prison board said.
The riots started at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have not yet been curbed.
In order to deal with the situation, the competent authorities led a special corps called "Tornado" to the site. Eight inmates are involved in the riots, who were pushed back into a wing of the building.
The members of the special corps suffered only minor head injuries, which were managed to be performed on the site.
A spokesman for the Penalty Enforcement Organization said: “A specially trained prison guard team manages the situation in the Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
In our prisons, we will not tolerate violence at any level, we will hand those responsible to the police and they can expect further imprisonment to be charged."
More than 500 convicts are detained in the Long Lartin male prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In October of last year, special forces were also needed to help bring down a serious riot, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a sudden flood (but the situation in drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depression, but this is what the state is expected to expect at the beginning of next week, when the remnant of a hurricane named Rosa sweeps through the desert southwest, drastically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparedness from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeastern regions of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rain.
The Phoenix meteorological service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within the 200-mile radius of Phoenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
Hurricane Katrina (1967), for example, approached the border of AZ 40 miles away.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50–100 mm of precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the south-western desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, etc.) 25–50 mm of precipitation can be expected, but in some places 100 mm can fall.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning floods, as the area is currently hit by severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on the south-west regions struggling with droughts.
“According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by a minimum of extreme drought, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It remains hurricane-force, and on Sunday morning, bringing up to 137 km/h of wind, it is about 600 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and will be heading north at a speed of approximately 19 km/h.
The storm in the Pacific Ocean will encounter colder currents and will lose its power.
The coast of Mexico is expected to reach again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rain can be expected, which significantly increases the risk of flooding.
“On average, rainfall can result in 70-150 mm precipitation from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm precipitation at times,” reports weather.com.
Rosa then travels north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona’s border on Tuesday, early in the morning, in the form of tropical depression, to sweep through Arizona, to the south of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The biggest threat posed by Rosa and her remains will be extreme rainfall in Lower California, Northwest Sonore, and the desert areas of the U.S. south-west,” the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening fork floods and draught flows in desert areas, and mountainous areas must be kept from landslides.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 4:00 a.m. local time, an injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to a hospital, his condition was “stable”.
Police said a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old men and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset during the night.
The authorities ask the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone record of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh had to suffer the “bad temper and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“Whoever votes to judge Kavanaugh will vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh’s candidacy meant that the Democratic Party “had to suffer its displeasure and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had committed sexual violence against her decades before, as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood up to his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans could see with their own eyes” Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and fearless character” that day.
“The votes cast alongside Judge Kavanaugh are votes cast alongside one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, who has an impeccable public service record,” Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as covertly referring to the importance of Republican voters taking part in the interim elections.
“Only five weeks will separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not going personally, but I’m actually going, he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats were following the tactics of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in a tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of deaths is rising
Many were swept away by the price, and at least 384 people died when the huge waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the nearly six meters (18 feet) high waves reached the shore at dusk, swept many away and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning was made yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, didn’t run away straight away, so they became victims of the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency (BNB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come in by itself, it drove cars, tails, houses and everything else from the shore,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the shore.
There were some who climbed to the top of the trees from the price and were saved, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
Air footage of the disaster published by the agency shows a number of demolished buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Further aftershocks shook the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (BPPT) said it had released about 200 times more energy during the earthquake on Friday than it had from a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions could strengthen the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was “significant”, in the disaster thousands of houses were destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured persons has been 540, and they are looking for another 29.
According to Nugroho, the number of injured people and the damage caused in the area called Donggala, which is 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, could be even greater, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is “completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, announcing that the organization’s experts and volunteers are on their way to the disaster-stricken area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse,” he added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday that it had not informed the public about the Palut tsunami, but the management said the waves reached the shore during the alert.
In one of the amateur videos shared on social media, a man tries to warn people from the upper floor of a building with desperate cries about the impending tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, carrying cars and buildings.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages, making communication around Palu impossible, making it harder for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army sent relief cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate relief work, and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under the tent poles set up in the office courtyard, but during their journey they encountered signs of terrible destruction, Dosheba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“It’s very bad.”
While relief teams were preparing for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign professionals with extensive experience in this field were unable to travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, any aid, aid shipment and personnel coming from overseas can only be admitted to the territory of the country if the location of the disaster is declared a disaster-stricken area at national level.
This has not happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international relief services in, but no announcement has yet been made.”
On the second evening after Friday’s upheaval and tsunami, I ask that the friends and family of the missing continue to look forward to their loved ones being among those whose miraculous escape brings some light to the dark atmosphere of the reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who was stuck in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held in Indonesia earlier this month.
In addition to the missing students, other students also resided at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what has happened is a great emotional burden for me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paragliders, for hours he desperately tried to reach the contestants at WhatsApp who were attending the beach festival.
In addition to the messages, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 abducted while filling up a ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 of a Brink’s employee, who was filling up an ATM with cash at Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the NYPD.
The driver of the money truck just emptied a bank machine at the entertainment center and was preparing to fill it with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man “approached his Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the police statement does not include the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who would provide information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the NYPD by phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The creature that was formerly called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while, and this was the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change of name was announced before Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release a new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande is replaced by Ariana Grande, who, citing “emotional reasons,” resigned from the show, said the producer.
The new name is not only an acronym for the current artist name of rapper – it has previously been revealed to be of religious significance to West.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier when talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you and I and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and from this it became just Ye, which symbolizes the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are.”
Ye is one of the famous rappers who love to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he will now prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether or not his name should be written in the same letter.
Mexican president vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised that he will never use force against civilians in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of student demonstrations in the bloodbath.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops in the square opened fire on participants of a peaceful demonstration, causing the deaths of some 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans – providing monthly financial benefits to students and planning to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organisations.
The U.S. should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for research in this direction, Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employer of artificial intelligence solutions, has said, who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced plans to become the world’s number one AI developer by 2030.
“Duplicate the cost of AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US, and the next breakthrough in the AI field is imminent,” Lee said.
By doubling research funding, the chances of the U.S. taking the next big step in artificial intelligence could double, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China’s most important MI-related companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later served as a member of Microsoft Research’s management and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology contests previously announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would take place, as it would be possible to find new future shapers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the state support they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that degrades scientific leaders, it’s big companies,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several large university skulls to work in the AI field.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could also greatly help the U.S.’s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s national science base provides support to academic staff in a similar way as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (MI) where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
NSF currently spends $100 million a year on supporting AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which was planning to set up a National Security MI committee, has not taken further steps in the cause for months.
A referendum to change the name of the country is held in Macedonia
The people of Macedonia voted in Sunday’s referendum to change the country’s name to the “North Macedonia Republic”. This move would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece that prevented the country from accepting its EU and NATO membership application.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is in need of a similar Greek territory, so far it has vetoed the country’s NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments reached a deal on the new name of the state, but national sentimental opponents said the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia’s Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation rate needed for a valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Do you support the country’s NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, together with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, as one of the countries that have emerged from the rubble of Yugoslavia, to have a chance to become a member of the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have stated that they feel that the result of the vote is binding.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to change the name.
According to the State Electoral Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate so far reached only 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which led to 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children because we have our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopje, the capital city.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted in favour of the name change in Strumica, in a referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the Parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for the boycotters of the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we would like to join with pride, with a raised head, and not through the maid’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be accounted for by investments in Macedonia that the country with more than 20% unemployment needs.
“I think the majority will support our case, as more than 80% of the country’s population basically supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He added that the “yes” vote means “insurance of the country’s future”.
According to a survey published last Monday by the political science research institute in Macedonia, 30–43 percent of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to a survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, a 57% participation rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least one vote more than 50%.
The ineffectiveness of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government, which came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player earns goal by scoring full Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took a close look at Brighton’s defenses, and Manchester City won a 2–0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass on the midfield as the first step of the attack, and
Hanging between the three Brighton defenders, he reached the open ground.
Then four green fields surrounded Aguero.
He cheated on a defender and then ran off to a close to the sixteenth in Brighton.
Then he went to the left for Sterling.
The English striker had already returned the ball to Aguero, forced to finish the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of the gate of Brighton's sleeper, Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
We agreed to play 55 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
With Sterling's action, he managed to get the blues to the initial advantage in the English championship match.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, when
The Aguero in Brighton got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played with the ball for a while before starting Sterling.
The Blues had just been able to put the ball into the goal before slipping outside the base line.
The City will play in Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, with Hoffenheim's team in the Champions League, starting at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
As the Nationals team missed the opportunity to get into the after-season, there was no reason for them to make a real effort.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, can’t wait to play against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance to play the game. Rockies has a match advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
Rockies secured at least one comforting spot with their 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still waiting for you.
“Despite the fact that we no longer have a chance, we can stand up against them in such a way that in Denver, the mood of the audience and the other team is expected to be on the roof right now compared to the whole year.
Of course I want to be on track like this!”
The Nationals team still has to choose the starting player for Sunday, but according to the news, in this situation Scherzer will be the pitcher.
For Scherzer, who took a throw training on Thursday, this will be his 34th start on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player this season has 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 parts.
Trump campaign in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation around the Supreme Jury candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters taking part in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones – I’m not going personally, but I’m going basically, so I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can use any means to regain power, evil and malice.
No matter who is harmed, no matter who is trampled on in order to have control, they have power. That's what they want, control and power, but we don't abandon ourselves."
According to the president, Democrats are using “resistance and obstruction.”
“They have seen all this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “an angry and malicious and dishonest and a liar.”
By name, he mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's judicial committee, after which he heard a loud disapproval of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what is it?
No, no, no, no, wait – all with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last of the long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has been treated in the same way for his unwavering stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Moreover, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which ironically are precisely the issues in which Jeremy also disagrees with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday stated that they wanted a “acceptable and productive meeting.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, however, today the tone has changed, and the promise of a more “moderate, courteous” policy has been forgotten, even if it ever happened.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate divergent views, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether the party’s leadership is acceptable.
This trend started not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have been waiting more and more recently to turn their backs on my individual opinion and to take a stand on things that I would never agree with, by the way, on national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, no matter what I actually said, they start to squander on social media, they demand my replacement, they criticize the politics of the middle, and they tell me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
This is not just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments I receive tend to be confined to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow politicians, who are forced to stand up for sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have renounced diversity, and with every motion for “incredulity” and every amendment of the electoral rules, the party is becoming more and more tolerant.
Over the past few years, many have advised me to hold back, not to be so outspoken, and then “everything will be fine.”
That’s not why I’m on a political path.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because I was so outraged that the Thatcher government neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed, and then I fought for better public service for the most in need, both as a local councilor and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done anything else in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was absolutely clear to everyone what political positions I was representing and on which topics I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also businesses and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
My most important message, however, is not for the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of substitution or political purpose will discourage me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.

Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr unbeatenly hits the top
Two late attempts have slightly modified the final result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s deserved victory at the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only unbeaten of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unrivalled defenses and superior use of the situation, the Hungarians and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to meet many challenges in our games so far, but we are still unbeaten, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has taken much more advantage of his situation than we have.”
Grant Anderson’s attempt to score a Frazier Cliffo point in the 14th minute made Ayr an advantage. Thanks to a yellow card from the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors, Melrose would have been able to make the difference, but Jason Baggot’s attempt was not a point.
Climo used a penalty to infuse Ayr's defense, just in the middle of the half, and then a single-person experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result in favour of Ayr.
Melrose began the second half, selling Baggo to Patrick Anderson, reducing the team’s downside to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and had to be taken off the pitch, and in the sequel, Ayr further increased his advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt, the beers of which were reaped with Climo's help.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose was able to stop Bruce Colvine's attempt in the superhuman world, breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for removing Climo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold it, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kick off and sent Gregor Henry down to try his fifth attempt at home.
Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be moving towards the hospitality industry: it turned out that he was at the head of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC’s popular series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the next ninth season would be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow’s “flowering hospitality industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no coastline, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the naval command in La Paz, decorated with sails.
There are ocean blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Bolivia, which has no coastline, still has vivid memories of the lost shore, which was captured by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, and a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the strongest for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice’s ruling in October, ending five years of negotiations.
“There is a ball in Bolivia that fills people with the spirit of belonging and peace, who are waiting for the end in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the basis of the hope that the Hague Court will stand by Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table after decades of rapsodic attitude so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president, who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election, may lose a lot of weight with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and that it would not change the situation much if its decision were beneficial to Bolivia.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to judge Chilean territories and has also agreed in advance that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling was issued just six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Zarate Paz, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the past four years have not helped Bolivia, but even pushed it back.
“The issue of the sea exit has been turned aside by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
Because of Morales’s hostile rhetoric, the Chilean remnants of goodwill are gone.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually quick.
For Bolivia, Monday offers a “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to “come out of a 139-year dispute,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the marine debate to forge political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment gives us an opportunity to see that it’s time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made to the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore summit.
The comment was made when it appeared that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was able to resume the frozen nuclear talks more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
According to Ri, I “want” to believe that the continued sanctions and American obstruction of the Korean War statement will ever be enough to put North Korea on its knees.
Washington vows to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism surrounding Pyongyang’s commitment to disarming the arsenal, which is probably considered the only key to the country’s security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows feature the huge headgear that will soon appear in the top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the day, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their 2019 spring/summer collection, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
The hats, which cannot be called practical, made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-raising works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with feather-like, wide claws and almost completely absorbed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories appeared gem-filled watermelons, a magic hat, and even an pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a man’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks, even just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouth sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a diving mask, complete with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a melting can of ice cream.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, then you're lucky.
According to style analysts’ prediction, huge caps may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of La Bomba, a 60 cm wide straw hat that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which conquered social media, behind a little practical hat, presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, which is almost the size of the swimsuit model that follows it.
The dark orange rafia bag – decorated by rafia bojt and with a white leather grip on top – was one of the highlights of Jacquemus’ 2019 Spring/Summer La Riviera collection on the Paris fashion week.
The star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that next summer huge hats and beach bags will appear in top-class clothing stores. The designer has created an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. Looking at the latest outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed in 2018, which is only further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in institutions of this kind, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers, and the position they occupy as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and implement customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it will get to their head.
But if you speak in his tongue, it will come to his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have achieved the best results from foreign languages.
68 percent of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher grade A (results above 85 percent).
Based on data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students received a higher A degree from Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved A.
These results also show that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as essential knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as chosen subjects have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics in both independent and other types of schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Vocational Training Commission found that 17 percent of employers found filling vacant positions to be difficult due to a lack of language knowledge.
From this we can see that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to enable young people to pursue a successful career.
As more and more workplaces expect knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career you choose, if you have studied a foreign language, you will gain lifelong knowledge that gives you a clear advantage.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to applicants who speak multiple languages.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which 4,000 adults were surveyed in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were not well enough in any foreign language to be able to speak to others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent) of the respondents.
This is why it is important to focus on language education for children.
Speaking in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, which, if equipped, can help them to apply for more important jobs as adults.
Every school in Scotland will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you will be able to learn several elective languages at independent schools, and you will be trained by educators who are experts in your field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It is not difficult to see that, in the current global business environment, languages are still vital for the future of a country, and education must reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools offer choice, diverse and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron presents in San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
They don’t have to wait long for fans who are sitting on needles to see LeBron James take the stage for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play for the opening game of the preseason Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you'll spend on the track is still questionable.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited amount of time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were for Lakers in the six-game preseason.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the preseason to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will start a long series of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This will be Trump’s first of five rumoured events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that a vote has been postponed to confirm the Supreme Court candidate for vacant seats, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the upcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when votes run out in November.
When does Trump’s event in West Virginia begin tonight, and where can I follow it online?
Trump’s speech in Weeing (West Virginia) will begin at 7am on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s gathering in West Virginia can also be followed online via YouTube’s live stream.
Trump is likely to be involved in this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, which was particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate’s confirmation vote was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the primary goal of the sudden increase in the number of events is to help Republicans before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the five events next week were “activating voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to defend and increase the majority that they currently own in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“To be able to control Congress is so critical of its political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are facing a tough campaign period,” a campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
The Wesbanco Arena event in Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco, Wesbanco
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who according to surveys is not in a favorable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to engage personally to better participate in surveys,” said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team struggles with full shoulder width in front of Sunday’s individual to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup was very much needed for the Saturday afternoon four games.
The swinging shirt of luck and momentum here and there is a sport concept that is quite airy, yet every player believes in it, especially in competitions such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had six-point driving, and they have only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball right here,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, with four points, Europe is still leading, and there are twelve more.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they have finally received a small back wind and can draw encouragement from many things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His lofty shouts of victory became louder and louder as he moved forward with the round, hit and matched with a critical swoop in the fourth game, with him and Thomas being double down after two.
The decisive roll of the game resulted in a similar cry of joy at hole 15, a kind that can make the viewer believe that everything is not lost to the American team.
“You just have to dig deep inside yourself and only care about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for the players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trace.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair of the Ryder Cup, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but adorable couple has brought four out of four, and it seems they can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not perform above par on a Saturday afternoon, and on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning, the last nine stages.
Thanks to this series, as well as the dynamics between them and the audience that supported them horribly, they have become the standard for Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure Europe’s victory on the Le Golf National track than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win in different holes at the same time.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the fourth hero of the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once and twice with two strokes above the par, the Spanish and Swedish reached the first nine holes, pushing them into a valley where they had no chance to climb out of it.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-player matches are extremely fun to watch from a close-up, thanks to the interaction of the pair. You can observe what advice you give, what you do not give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage over the last day, but this section of section four has shown that the American team has the necessary courses to fight, although many of them have been missed, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after finishing the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday with a result of 10-6 against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari doubles led the race, winning two victories against the infirmary Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, who is trying to win back the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the ever-failed American team in the four-ball games of the morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. faced greater resistance during the fours, bringing two matches, but they couldn’t make the difference either.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a series, while he and Molinari, who are referred to as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After defeating Woods-Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau in a strong 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes still stuns his talent, but lost 19 of his 29 matches to four-ballers and four-players, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning during the four-ball season, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and was defeated in the fours 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third place in the world rankings.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this pleasant, windy day, south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do this with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory against the Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball team and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 ratios after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice did a team recover from the four-point handicap in individual races, although a draw by Furyk's defending team is enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being only the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems quite improbable.
“It’s impossible for North Korea to unilaterally dissolve if you don’t trust your negotiating partner.”
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and there is no way that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant and generous steps” last year, e.g. halting nuclear and missile tests, closing the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and scope of application of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
“Without trust in America, we feel that our nation’s security is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is impossible to break down unilaterally and first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment at Washington’s resistance to the idea of a “phase-out” nuclear disarmament, which, according to the scenario, would receive North Korea’s rewards for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed significant, however, because he did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a powerful US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim promised to work on a “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s integrity.
North Korea is seeking to officially score by the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States believes that Pyongyang must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not allow strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increases pressure by sanctions to force its will on us, and they also protest against declaring the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can force us to kneel is a dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relief sanctions only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump would be planned, but was specifically addressed by the US President at the UN earlier this week.
The minister said three meetings had been held between Kim and South Korean President Mun Dzein over the past five months, adding: “If the country affected by nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the United States, then the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate.”
Despite this, Ri’s speech sounded dramatically different from last year’s UN General Assembly when he said that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, “the evil president,” called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened “total destruction” in North Korea last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but he also noted that there is still much work to be done and the sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit was imposed, meaning “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps taken so far.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday: “The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must be strictly observed until the actual, final and verifiable nuclear disarmament has been achieved.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with R<0xC3><0xAD>v during the UN General Assembly’s recess, and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been very successful.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making “gangsterlike demands” hours later.
At a meeting with Munnal this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States “takes the necessary steps.”
Kim’s “good steps” would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the steps that could lead to normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to rest enough
This year, a new subject at Harvard University encouraged students to sleep more, fighting against the ever-growing macho culture of caffeine-heated all-night learning.
An academic came to the conclusion that students from the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, which he believes was the first such training in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard College of Medicine and practises as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why do I only now face this as a senior?’”
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised him,” he told Telegraph.
The course, launched for the first time this year, provides students with an overview of how appropriate sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and sports performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and director of the university’s health service, the university decided to start the course because during the seven-week period, the students were found to be extraordinarily incapacitated.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and why bedtime routine is important.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons to encourage participants to rethink their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of our students.
But we think they have the right to this knowledge – just as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which it is considered a performance to learn through one night continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students result in more and more problems caused by sleeplessness.
Sufficient and quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to protect them from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain to starve and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year Harvard was the first to take one of the professor’s courses.
He said that what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to start training at university level.
He hopes that as a next step, graduate students will also be able to participate in a similar degree program before settling in the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning for bedtime, an alarm for waking up, and get acquainted with the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily distract them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult for them to fall asleep.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb, Steven Gerrard, crashed his team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxians tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 win in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard lost his second defeat to Gary Holt as the manager in 18 games, leaving eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the halftime, and the unmotivated team of the Rangers was nowhere near a match.
While the Rangers went down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, just behind Hibernian because of the goal difference.
In addition, Rangers may face additional difficulties after the coast sign Calum Spence's head injury caused him to need medical attention due to an object likely dropped from the guests' stands.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that entered the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup with Ayr's sweep.
Livingston entered the field with the same 11 people who took a point from Hearts last week, and would have been happy to watch his perfect team suffocate their opponent’s game wherever they could.
Although the Rangers led the ball possession, Livingston did more with what he got.
They could have scored a goal in the first two minutes, when Menga started Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed at Team Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a penalty at the fifteenth minute when he clashed with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the first two semi-finals, but the former ibroxian goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Liv's attempt at the 34th minute was against the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers lost a ziccer forced by Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield did not react in time when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga well for easy ending.
Gerrard decided on a break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game when the extreme Morelost jumped, but the stunning shape of Kelly was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to play a game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halket swept up the long balls in a row.
Holt's team could have forged a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor held the net well and struck Jacobs' position before Lithgow pulled him out of a corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he got hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson was not convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
A detail of our "Sunday morning" almanach: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago...the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could lead to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which featured odd cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is this miracle?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. It can be used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put this headset on, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, it's a bit bumpy right now."
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in his invention.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
Thus, they are able to "see" the protein that accompanies a variety of cancers. Treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
Part of the method is the extraction of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to "see" the protein HER2, which is a frequent contributor to a variety of cancers; then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of multiple cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and “teaching” how to attack cancer cells has been used successfully in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West’s SNL role in the MAGA cap culminated in an abusive tiara supporting Trump.
It didn't go too well
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent statement in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would apply for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, in his Make America Great Again Cap that night, he began to speak out against the Democrats, and again stressed that he supported Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, he asks, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’”
“If I were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Matt Damon opened the SNL show with a parody in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh made a mockery of his testimony before the Senate Justice Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's talk was uploaded to social media by humorist Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by charging.
West even complained to the audience that he had been stabbed behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
They're intimidated!
And they said I was in a sunken place,” Washington Examiner said.
West continued, “You want to see a sunken place? I’m going to wear my Superman cape, because that means they can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His appearances were accompanied by whistles from the audience at least twice, and SNL actors seemed embarrassed, according to one eyewitness to Variety: “The whole studio was silently silent.”
Westet was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
West asked questions when he performed his song I Love It dressed as Perrier.
Westet, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, assured his support in a tweet: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR BECOME TO WORK.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “self-sufficient, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided not to reward anyone (by purchasing his music or fashion items or by supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he owns and distributes an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
"But we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and now he is “the creature that was previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His rapper Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course, the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
Belfast Restaurant Delay Accused of Attempting to Kill
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant has to stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, Star of the Game of Thrones, finds exaggerated masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow's Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent, medieval fantasy series, he often takes a sword.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, stressing that in the sight of such heroes, little boys often feel that a hard action is needed to assert respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, he said he had “taken something aside” and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of exaggerated masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie, said she felt it was very important to remedy the problem.
“I personally am deeply concerned about this matter – how did the depiction of masculinity become so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What have we taught men in their childhood about the problem we are facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculinity, since the shows often feature very masculine characters.
As he continued to think, he added: “What was born with us, and what are we learning?
What does the street and TV say to young boys that make them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because it clearly shows that something is wrong with the young men.”
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season closes, he will not be included in the Game of Thrones series or sequels because he is “already fed up with battlefields and horses.”
As of November, Kit Sam will play the lead role in the remake of his film Shepard True West, which is about a producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor said the best thing he got from the Game of Thrones was his wife Rose, whom he met while making the series.
“I met my wife on the set, so I owe my future family and my life ahead of me to the series,” Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China’s number of new patients increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, this means more than 820,000 people.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to previous cases, a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually infected.
The disease has spread at a rapid rate with the transfusion of blood that had previously been infected in some parts of China.
Health officials, however, said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of such cases has since declined to nearly zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men end up marrying women due to the country’s conservative values.
The disease spreads in these relationships in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
The Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines since 2003 as part of a program to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff members leaked data from Republican senators and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Los Angeles Democratic Representative, the allegations in question were spread by “extreme right” experts and websites.
“Written lies, lies and even more lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information released was allegedly based on the address and phone number of Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was posted to the Internet on Thursday. The publisher’s identity is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee for sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState say the source IP address can be linked to Waters’s office, and data has been reported from a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill writes.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false,” Waters continued.
– My staff member has no responsibility for leaking information. However, his or her right to anonymity, protection of his or her personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously false.”
Waters' statements on the Internet were quickly criticized, including critics Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“Based on this, it seems that Waters does not have the blood pressure required for the position of representative.
If someone is suspected of something he has not committed, he cannot react to it in anger.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
You need to stay calm and calm.”
Waters’ reaction was like that of Judge Kavanaugh, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had informed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies” about false charges.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified,” Waters continued, “and that they are legally held liable for any act that endangers or harms any member of the crew.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's spy comedy paralyzing
It has now become a tradition that we are looking for references to Brexit in every British-related film, and there can be no exception to this in the category of action comedy/parody franchise under the name Johnny English, the first part of which, Johnny English in 2003, the second part, reloaded by Johnny English in 2011.
Will the sarcastic satires parodiing ourselves become the new export product of the British nation, in which we are living by our own apparent paralysis?
It’s so certain that Johnny English, a gritty, rubber-faced, incompetent man, had enough ammunition for another return – it’s clear from his name that this comic character was created so that crowds of viewers from non-English-speaking countries can laugh at it.
Johnny English is, of course, a shattered secret agent who thinks he's attractive with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes of Mr. Bean, and sometimes of the guy who contributed to the performance of the headliner of the 2012 London Olympics by pressing a single key.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, who left chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and when he arrived, the rotors clung to his helmet for a few moments.
The comic vein of Atkinson is well established in the film, but the humor of the film doesn’t really work, and even seems superfluous, as nowadays, the “serious”-sounding franchises like James Bond films and Mission Impossible series have the courage to touch the instrument of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me Johnny English’s hilarious, unlucky adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The film’s starting point is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal hacked into the British spy network’s super-secret online network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest horror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last nail in the coffin of the self-righteous and divisive prime minister whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors outline that since it was discovered that all active agents were involved, he would have to set up a retired agent for the job.
This retired agent, of course, is Johnny English, two-handed, who has been working as a teacher at a prestigious school since his retirement, but unlike the curriculum, teaches children to espionage – there are funny scenes here, of course, as he describes the basics of espionage in English in some way called “Rocksuli”.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he reunites with Bough, his former long-suffering arms carrier, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and married the captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always up to his ears – played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
So the two-handed Batman and Robin pair of His Majesty’s National Security Service are back in action and confront Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly being networked by a charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is playing it.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as a waiter, then smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury yacht in the midst of an incredible upheaval, and English will truly free the hell out of trying to get to know Volta’s apartment using a VR headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end, but whatever the fun and the turnaround, it may be too much of an impression of a children's film.
The end result is quite mediocre.
As with other Johnny English films, I have the question: Can the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day work week while paying the British five-day pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan to introduce a four-day working week, all with workers working for five days' wages.
The party claims that it wants workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution, so that CEOs would give employees an extra day off thanks to increased revenue.
According to the plan, employees would get a three-day weekend while taking home the same number as before.
According to the sources, the idea would be “fit” for the party’s economic program, which aims to bring the language of the balance sheet to the workers’ side in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Trade Unions Congress, so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
One of the Labour Party’s senior officials told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party’s program that would tilt the balance to the workers in the economy and also fits into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned with the promise of a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Last week, shadow finance minister John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution affecting the economy at a Labour Party conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to recapture power from “faceless directors” and “beneficiaries” of the regime.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of water companies would not recover the full profits they deserve, since a pro-worker government would make “deductions” as a punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he plans to make workers members of the Board of Directors and set up Inclusive Owners Funds, which would group 10% of the shares of private sector companies into employees, which could also earn 500 important dividends a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy revealed on 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote on Kavanaugh’s election to the Supreme Court will be held at least one week later than the original date. The question is whether the outcome of the investigation can dissuade Republican MPs enough to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the case broke out, after the charges appeared, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
His answer was clear and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete-proof.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and I need very serious accusations to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the allegations,” Graham said, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, will begin in New York on Saturday. At the festival, world stars will appear to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival is being held for the seventh time, and tens of thousands of people are expected to attend the Central Park Grand Pázsit, where participants will not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also be able to draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eradicate poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest group aimed at eradicating poverty by actively involving more people in the fight against poverty.
The concert is free of charge for those (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or “acts”, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in achieving its goals in the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clicktivism” when people feel that they have made a meaningful contribution to a case by signing an online petition or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, according to the data of the Global Citizen, more than 19 million “acts” have been carried out by the project’s supporters, which have served many different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to the separation of world leaders from poverty policies and commitments of $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that they came from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid out or collected during fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the money raised had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors that aims to “help children reach their potential.” The organization pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, social injustices and malnutrition can be banished into the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in more than 5,000 actions, the government has allocated funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions published on the Global Citizen website is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eradicated?”
According to the Global Citizen, “It will be a long and difficult journey in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we also achieve our goal because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also perform at this year’s New York event, and the hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. deploys naval “block” to prevent Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, adding that Washington Examiner would use the Navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering the market, and Russian energy would not reach the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s active presence in Syria, particularly in relation to Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Interior Minister, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure with its navy that maritime routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of a non-profit event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group, by the way, defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran, and noted that these are essentially the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned in roughly the same way economically: by using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, while calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing to Russia’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why the Trump administration’s senior officials, including the president himself, are urging Germany to put a stop to the “incorrect” pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is against the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we are of the same opinion that energy should not be used for pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt by the Americans to convince him was backfired, as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Association (BDI) after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts “considers seriously” to run for presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday after the mid-term elections that she would “consider seriously” to run for presidency.
Warren confirmed at a city meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was considering starting.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and fix a poorly functioning government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
“After November 6th, I am seriously considering starting for the presidency.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's Massachusetts voters don't think Warren should run for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Analysis Center at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of voters in Massachusetts who voted for Warren “a good chance” say the senator shouldn’t run for the presidency, while
32% support Warren's candidacy.
According to the survey, the majority of respondents, 38%, and 48%, would support Deval Patrick’s previous presidential candidate.
The 2020 presidential election included the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders in Vermont.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to start by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's Meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after enrolling in September
Arrested Monday night for domestic violence
“What my son is going through, what he is going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are going home with,” Sarah Palin told the audience at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin’s son called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that his son, like other war veterans, “returned changed, hardened, and constantly pondered whether he had due respect for the service that his comrades, pilots, and all other members of the army had done for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, and Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police, said in a report that Track Palin had committed domestic violence with a gun and drunk.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen Member States and Washington D.C. also support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy, according to which those fleeing gang or domestic violence cannot be granted asylum.
Representatives from 18 different Member States as well as Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is attacking politics in court, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace vs. Sessions, which was initiated by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been made public.
The plaintiff’s wife claimed that her partner and her “sons of violent crime” were mistreated, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications to the United States come from, as violence by criminal gangs and domestic violence is a constant problem in these countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy has withdrawn a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.’s Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “has ignored decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“According to federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter reads.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that a policy against immigration would harm the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest levels of jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“A right to asylum is a right to leave your country because of racial, religious, national affiliation, persecution for the sake of belonging to a particular social group or political conviction, or because of a well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the problems people face every day around the world, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of deaths doubled, rescue teams race against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as a feverish little boy calms down at the evacuation center of the disaster-stricken Palu.
The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water.”
Some of the residents returned to their homes to rescue them from the soaked stuff that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are not able to provide people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with broken spines and shoulders, were taken to the Palui Military Hospital. Patients were provided outside the hospital building due to high-strength aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the fifth-floor hotel room in which he and his wife and daughter were occupied, and he trembled in a devastating earthquake.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I was stuck in the walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family came to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of threatening the country with propaganda
The U.S. Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to his advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest-selling newspaper, while accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6.
Trump accuses Beijing of attempting to interfere in U.S. elections, some U.S. officials say it is a new stage in Washington’s increasingly powerful action against China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which more and more tariffs are imposed on each other’s imported products.
According to US and Chinese experts, Chinese tariffs imposed at the beginning of the trade war as a response aimed at exporters in countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for several cycles, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses, as the state of Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is even more sensitive to our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government takes advantage of the highly respected American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all reflect the Chinese people’s different and different views on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that “one of China’s most prestigious newspapers refused to bring down” his article, but did not name it.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters with Kavanaugh scandal before the mid-term elections
Analysts say it may fall to her mind that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate, in the cross-beam of sexual harassment allegations, and that she may lose support for women voters in the run-up to the mid-term elections.
The incident sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, in a Saturday article on The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake at the last minute would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for MoveOn, a newspaper based in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning, some protesters in the Senate corridor complained that "November is approaching!" because despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, the Republican-controlled Justice Committee, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an incredible extent,” independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg said in a statement.
“Many people say it’s already been very high, and that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the precarious female voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years old), who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, the analysts assumed that he could retaliate with Republicans if they continued to stand for Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he accuses the Supreme Court nominee of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was grounded on a gross soil,” NBC News said earlier this week, according to Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee.
“It’s not just about the committee vote and the final vote, it’s about whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about how Republicans handled the case and how Ford behaved,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. Director of Democratic Elections.
It seems, however, that Americans are quite divided on whether Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony is true, and Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford's.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony in full or rather, while 35% of respondents at Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied about his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed Ford.
In response to Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is Kavanaugh's other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford took an oath to the Senate Justice Committee a week ago that Kavanaugh was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when both of them studied at Yale.
The inventor of the internet will launch a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “to gain control of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application with Solid’s technology allows people to create their own “personal online data warehouse”, also known as POD.
This can include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online repository is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access his data.
The company calls this “the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data”.
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company’s mission is to provide resources, processes and the right skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not asking Facebook and Google if they want to introduce the full-changing technology that would turn companies’ business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post published on Medium on Saturday that Inrupt “is sending commercial energy and providing an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
Berners-Lee changed the internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been involved in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet in recent months.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I’m definitely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates minister serving in the First World War
The only Anglican pastor to receive the Victoria Cross is celebrated in his hometown 100 years after his heroic act in World War I.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned the honor during the attack on Bellenglis and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest honor of the British Armed Forces.
The memorial was unveiled by two grandchildren at a Saturday ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolic” that the monument was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s honorable act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal on September 29, 1918, “in the midst of heavy fog and fierce artillery and machine gunfire.”
Later, he hurried to the front line, and with “exceptional heroism” he was at the head of the battalion, and then he stormed a camp cannon detachment on his own, destroying three of its members.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper was shot by Reverend Bernard Vann – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never get to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said 72-year-old Michael Vann.
After a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann also crowned the Memorial Stone.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to play a role in the ceremony and added: “The bravery of a true hero is demonstrated by the number of people who express their respect for him later.”
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206 broadcast, instead receiving Peppa pig
Imagine that you've been up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206, and the broadcast is missing.
There were 13 clashes on the San José show, six of which were broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 at night as part of the main competition.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, the English spectators were surprised to see Peppa pig instead of the match.
This was difficult for many who stayed up until the morning hours because of this confrontation.
The children’s cartoon instead of the MMA game was dubbed by one of the fans as “some kind of sick joke” on Twitter.
“According to state regulations, this kind of content can no longer be broadcast by the channel at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President, Communications and Marketing at Bellator.
"Yes, it's Peppa, it's pig time."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has promised to revise the schedule of the show in a way that will take UK viewers into account in the future.
“I think we can do it over and over again,” Coker said.
“But since it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is Monday for them, we can’t fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was switched on, a lot of messages were received, and most of them were not very friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we're talking about. We're dealing with a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of the previous six, there will be only five matches in the program – we really wanted to please the audience, but we paid off.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggles with a minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone at a young age because of his sexual orientation, but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the broadcaster that she was standing up for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent presenter of the long-lived show, has missed several months due to illness.
Daley, who was invited on Laverne’s first show as a “boat wreck,” said he felt “less than anyone else” because “socially it was not acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day it is the feeling of inferiority and difference from which I draw endurance and strength to achieve my successes.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” to not disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his role in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, has asked the governments of the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke about the matter because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and her 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter got married last year and said the age difference was never a problem.
“If a man goes through so much at a young age,” he said, “he was in his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in his own age who has experienced similarly extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy in June who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, according to Daley's own confession, was completely upsetting his attitude towards the world.
“If they asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had the tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t answer him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the first line anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I could not accept that my father was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt this was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of an audience at the Olympic Games at home, and there was nothing better than that,” he said.
Her first song, Heather Small Proud, helped her a lot in the Olympic preparations, and to this day she will still be a goose-skinned if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 local time.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by participating in his 47th Cup match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to win back his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays the record for the 12th time at the event held every two years, but due to his performance in four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday, Captain Jim Furyk sent him to the bench.
Instead of having five players at the heart of the events, as often as they had to fight for the victory of the United States, he now spends half of the day training his team, and tries to correct the mistakes that weaken his game.
At the top of his career, he was never among the most accurate hitters, so the 48-year-old player doesn’t really have a narrow track at Le Golf National, where high grass costs a very high price for a faulty hit.
And if the pitch itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact match of Francesco Molinari in the 9th game on Sunday, who won all four of his matches this week in the first Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans with a four-point disadvantage start strong before the 12 individual matches, then Mickelson’s match can be decisive.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, hugged me and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He is extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and the past week.
Basically, I didn't have two games for him.
I planned more, but in the given situation, we decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record on Sunday, where no one has played more matches in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series of Ryder Cups that are far below the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 wins and seven draws, but Furyk stressed that the presence of a veteran player has no tangible benefits for the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the games they played against him, and that’s good to see.
His presence goes beyond the strict sense of play.”
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup that holds individual matches, luck can easily turn its back on him.
The Danish player first appeared in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros won a five-point advantage against the Americans, and by the end they had just managed to keep a hairline advantage over the 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“We must always remind ourselves that, in spite of our great advantage in Valderra, we won only one hair, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally lost,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said after the victory of the 2018 class on Friday 5–3 and yesterday, leading to 10–6 at Le Golf National.
“It’s enough to think about the races of previous years, and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
Tomorrow you'll have to play with full force.
So come and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I am mostly dealing with 12 players in our team, but we also need to pay attention to the other side, who happen to be among the biggest players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who is proud of the team’s hard track performance, added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Then everything depends on individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It’s a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, you’ll find out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
This is what players need to understand to get the best out of themselves on the pitch tomorrow.
They have to break up with their partner, who will also have to take the best form.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent’s team, is confident that his players will perform better individually than in a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrection: Brookline was a member of the winning team, and then the losing team was on the losing side after the European team’s braving performance as a “miracle in Medinah”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asking him, “because he encouraged the players before the last day, Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re getting the best start in Brookline, as we’ve seen in Medina.
If one team really swings into it, it puts the opponent’s players under enormous pressure in the middle matches.
Accordingly, we have set the order and prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with taking the lead in his efforts to reverse the job and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided on the order because I think that’s how the picture is made from the beginning to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added.
Germany's newest warship has been postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war ships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it will wait at least until next year.
The inauguration of the all-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, the Rhineland-Palatinate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a spokesman for the army.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class frigates.
We know that it will be equipped with a high-fired cannon and a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-watercraft missiles and camouflage technology, including a signal damper that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that you need less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the continuous slippage of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may become obsolete as soon as they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The F125 fregatt was released last year, when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There is not much information about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentions a number of critical “software and hardware errors” that make the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are a major problem, as only 120 sailors will be served on the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships, which is only half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was extremely overweight, which worsened its performance and made it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as the German ships of the same class set up in World War II.
Apart from the faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial draft has calculated EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany’s maritime presence is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament’s National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the Navy “is running out of take-off warships.”
In the meantime, according to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-exciting process, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the outpourings.
He expressed concern that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Investigates the Secret Life of Bats
New research is being carried out on a Scottish-Highland estate, which aims to find out how bats exploit the characteristics of the landscape while hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behavior of single flying mammals, which could also benefit future conservation initiatives.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats, brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the sound content of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species is doing what.
The researchers also create a habitat map and report to help determine in detail how animal behavior develops depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for bats and which species use them.
This information will help determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the formation of meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other species involved.
In Scotland and the UK, bat populations have significantly decreased over the past century.
Construction and spatial development work disrupts the sleeping places of animals and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are a risk factor for them, just as they are exposed to flypapers, certain chemical procedures used for building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their night-time predatory nature, they rely more on their hearing when they hunt for prey than on their vision.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasound reflection, they can determine the exact position of insects as well as the terrains in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-place tests and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Three Estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
"Here, in Threave, they have a great place for bats," he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also stressed the importance of making sure that bats live there before renovating buildings, as the destruction of a single settlement could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitat is prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for help from the population.
He said: “There is still a lot of information we don’t know about bats, and we have almost no information about the situation of the populations of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape a “false news” against him, saying others want to use his name to “get into the public domain.”
The football attorneys are ready to sue the German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The Portuguese squad member and the Juventus striker were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to her, the athlete paid her $375,000 to listen to the incident, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said in an Instagram Live video with 142 million fans that the news was “false.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
“The things that have been brought together about me today are all lies,” the five-time gold-ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into public consciousness.
That's what happens.
They want to be famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added, accompanied by a smile.
Because of allegations called “unacceptable, privacy-infringing suspicions,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for compensation “for the moral damage caused to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete’s suite, where the man anally raped a woman, according to documents filed with the District Attorney’s Office in Clark County, Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent good boy” except for “one percent.”
On the basis of the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he said this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and made a visit to a hospital for his injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was “afraid of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the incident in question continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was just in front of a transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, the Italian giant Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret’ car factory loss forever
“The UK will regret it forever if it loses its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit,” said Greg Clark, the UK’s business minister.
He added that Toyota UK is “worried” by a statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily shut down production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jobs could be cut off due to delays at the borders.
The factory in Burnaston, producing Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I see that if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production shutdowns in the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also expressed concerns about the likelihood of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minik plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU member states.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the disruption at the borders could lead to production delays and spare parts shortages, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough spare parts at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, so production should be stopped.
Clark said his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was “fully designed to avoid delays at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions that will not only benefit from our current successes, but will also offer new opportunities,” the BBC Radio 4 Today said in a statement.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we definitely need to maintain our currently highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota was unable to tell how long production would last, but warned that the combined costs could worsen the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the plant in Burnaston and is currently representing the Unite trade union, the trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, we will never get back the jobs that are going to end.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a concrete and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, White House said.
“They can postpone another week,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump at a large-scale meeting, as the debate on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court candidate continues, the White House said in a statement.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian influence on elections, possible links between Trump’s advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months in Washington, it has been speculated that Trump will eventually run away from Deputy Attorney General, putting Mueller's independence in jeopardy.
According to this month’s report by the New York Times, Rosenstein was considering coming to the meeting wired to record a conversation with the president, and the question was raised as to whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and there was a rumor that he would submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who had a United Nations presence in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “not welcome” Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, which delayed the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a designated date for this week, but in the light of the high court cases, I see a chance of another one-week postponement.
It will soon be revealed, and I, as always, will notify the press."
However, some journalists were sceptical about this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked about this.
Sanders replied that the rarity of the press conferences was not due to his opposition to the “sensation-hungry” behavior of television reporters, but added: “I don’t dispute the fact that they are sensational-hungry.”
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and representatives of the press would take place more often.
“The president gives me more questions and answers than any previous president,” he said, adding that without supporting the claim, “we looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, “If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s better to talk to me with the light years than with the light years.
We often try to do this, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so instead of the White House press conferences, they can speak to the President of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly answers reporters’ questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, the press conferences held alone are quite rare.
Why, perhaps, can be deduced from what happened this week, when the president in New York made an unusual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the Health Ministry has addressed NHS Scotland’s EU staff in a letter about Brexit concerns
The head of the Health Ministry expressed his gratitude to the employees of the Scottish NHS from the countries of the European Union in a letter and said he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s expected withdrawal.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs of the settled status applications of EU citizens working in the decentralised public service.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exits continued, with the result of which a decision is expected to be made in the autumn.
The UK government is also working on a possible unagreed scenario.
I know what a disturbing time this could be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to help the healthcare ministry work, which also has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is also your home and we want you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
An emergency surgery was performed on the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, after he suffered head injury on Saturday after losing 31-27 in a match against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term.
"He walked to the shoreline and just fell," Reed said.
The coaching team and the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put it on a stretcher and took it to further investigations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he “has no further details on the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-old second-year student, spends his first season on the Tennessee State team, to which he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented five successful sets before leaving the field, so it will be at 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK, and with this additional revenue they would support homeless people.
This step would neutralise Corbyn’s success among young voters
The tax increase is aimed at those who are not taxed in the UK.
According to the Treasury’s calculations, this would amount to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year in revenue to support homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK, and the resulting surplus income will be used to support the homeless, plans to announce Theresa May at a press conference today.
The aim of the move is likely to be to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the UK, and the additional revenue from this will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current fee, which is calculated in addition to the higher fee charged two years ago to the second apartments and properties purchased for the purpose of spending, can reach up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects an annual revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens, causing a significant price increase, which makes the situation of first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become “spirit cities” especially in the capital, as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in taxes to help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
He personally considers large construction companies to be responsible for keeping property prices high, who have become accustomed to buying up and leaving land on a par. He asked May to cancel the quotas imposed on affordable houses and start something with the “home market shame situation” in the country.
Corbyn has announced remarkable proposals for housing reforms, including wage control and the elimination of evictions without good reason.
It would also give councils more power and opportunity to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my Prime Minister’s office to restoring the English dream and to making life better for each generation.
The real estate market needs to be resolved.
Britain remains open, as always, to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country, as well as companies with foreign interests, should be able to buy real estate just as easily as those working hard in England.
Dreams weaved from home have become almost inaccessible to too many people, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible.”
Jack Ross: “My greatest desire is to be the manager of the Scottish team.”
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s coach, said his “highest desire” was to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, with only three points behind the top-ranked.
He moved his seat to the Stadium of Light after successfully returning St. Mirren's team to the first-class Scottish Football Championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserve, Ross said on his BBC Sportsound show in Scotland.
“When I was a child, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
Now, however, I have a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
Sunderland's management position includes Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned about the need to follow the footsteps of such big names, and has previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I am measuring success at the moment to see if I can bring the team back to the first class.
If we take into account the structure and facilities of the club, it will undoubtedly be in the first-class league, he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I’ll only see my activity here as a success if I can get the club back.”
Ross’ management career began just three years ago, after working as a substitute coach for Dumbarton for a while, and spent 15 months in Hearts’ coaching staff.
He then helped Aolla recover after the team fell back to the third division and won the championship with St. Mirren on the edge of the fall in the following season.
Ross says he feels much more confident now than he has ever been in a career as a player, whether it's Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a decisive moment,” he recalled as the coach of Alloa.
“I clearly thought management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds weird because I did well, I had a really good life out of it, and actually, I had some really memorable moments.
However, players’ lives are sometimes very hard.
There is a lot to go through every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel best in my skin all my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Sportsound's Sunday, September 30th.
According to a study, beer falls best on Saturday afternoon at 5:30.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of the UK pubs in difficulty increased significantly, but the pressure on the restaurant chains is still very high.
According to the data collected, the income of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consulting firm, who compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny period and England’s longer-than-expected role in the World Cup, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced an increase of 2.8% in revenue, with the difference that there was an even greater decline in restaurants.
In July, the decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June continued to worsen.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell alcohol performed best, producing even higher growth than the drop in restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also adversely affected by the long-lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
People seem to prefer to drink at this time.
The revenue from drinks from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, while the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results follow a trend that has been unfolding since the end of April.
The weather and major community and sports events continue to be the main revenue factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual decrease in revenue of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only over time reveal whether the more moderate weather in August will bring relief in this area as well.”
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is widely accepted as an industry focus, collects and analyzes performance data from a group of more than 9 billion operators with 47 members in total.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children (up to 11 years old) has a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta-socials” is increasing
The news increases fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students said they had a “main” account that their parents could see.
One in five children (even at the age of 11) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta accounts” is rapidly increasing, referring to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students said they had an unsightly “head” account that their parents could see, but they also created private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page found a teenager’s profile saying “rape me.”
According to a study by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and 50% admit they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of HMC.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “sporter’s voice” in the Scottish Athletics Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said the sport’s decision-makers will be invaluable in their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am delighted to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sports leaders.”
The American athlete, who regularly speaks as an expert on the BBC, scored two of his four Olympic gold medals at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres, but was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary cerebral circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would take time to decide if I would be able to recover at all.
I've been able to recover completely, I can walk again, I'm going to agility training today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Mothers share online community with a breast-sucking advertisement similar to cows
There was a heated online debate about an advertisement by a breast pump company that compared nursing mothers to headgear.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first silent, wearable breast pump” and advertised the release of their product in an ironic advertisement that evoked music videos that showed the freedom the device gives to mothers who milk their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stable full of straw, while in the background you can hear the lyrics that show the following lines: “Yes, I’ve got my head, I don’t even have my tail” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t my breasts, but my breasts.”
And the chorus is like, "I'm pumping, I'm pumping, the kid's eating big, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm killing the girls."
The advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page quickly became a crossfire in online discussions.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed reviews. According to many, advertising is making fun of the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s very unsavory to advertise the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life to their offspring, but their wines are taken away from them within days.”
Elvie breast extractor can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment said: “Yes, it’s terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast milk to mothers who can keep their children?”
Someone else added, “It’s a completely insensitive advertisement.”
Others came to protect advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “very funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought it straight away if I were still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who milk their milk in their workplace or in a toilet, who feel “sheep” because of it.
It is not the dairy industry that praises or condemns.”
At the end of the video, the women show that during the dance, the discreet breast sucker was in their bra.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast milk sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires and tubes, it can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communications director, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
To point out the parallel between women who milk their milk and headgear, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps and to show in a funny way how our breast pump provides a feeling of freedom compared to that.”
Elvie's breast pump didn't get on the news for the first time.
At the London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother, Marta Jakubowski, stepped on the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children in custody has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can partly be explained by the fact that it is more difficult for them to find host homes due to the harsh rhetoric and measures of the Trump administration.
The recipients are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be compromised if they applied to receive the children.
This threat continued to increase in June when it was announced that parents applying for admission and adults living with them in a household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minors were arrested.
The office later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were unpunished.
“Eighty percent of those who apply for admission and those who live in a household with them are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are convicted criminals.
That is why we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear before the court within one month of being detained instead of 60 days, the social workers say.
Many people sign up in court via videoconferencing instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer detention takes, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the chances of violent outbursts or escape attempts increase.
According to human rights defenders, these risks are only increased by a larger facility, similar to the one in the towers, where the number of children makes it more difficult to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they don’t give the children enough time to prepare or say good-bye to friends before they are transferred to such a facility, they will make them even more traumatized.
Syria calls for immediate departure of US, French and Turkish "stopping forces"
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking in front of the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the civil war that raged in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who holds the deputy prime minister’s post, said foreign forces had illegally entered Syria, citing the fight against terrorism, and “they will be treated in the same way.”
“They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes.
He declared that Damascus “continues its holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence.”
There are 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, most of whom assist Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad as trainers and advisors.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were right for their return, and that only “some Western countries” provoked “irrational fears,” deterring refugees from returning home.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return home,” he said.
“They made a policy on a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a conflict zone around the last great stronghold of the rebels, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a widespread attack on the three million-strong province.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action would be directed only against jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-affiliated an-Nusra Front, which “must be eradicated.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the elections.
Under Moualem's terms, the Syrian government's participation in the committee, for example, considers it acceptable only to "review some articles of the current constitution" and warns all external actors against interference in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020 unless the hopes of many liberals come to fruition, and he will not end his presidency before a prosecution or scandal.
We can be sure that this will be “the most dramatic presidential final of all time.”
For now, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN’s main-time viewing has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its viewing to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers on the main show instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is the most watched cable TV show with its 3.5 million audience on the evenings of the most important news days.
“It attracts us like a fire because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Designated Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking mini-series of the Cabinet sits on the chair after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, said otherwise.
This is how a Boston taxi trip before the 2016 election comes to mind:
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” asked Scovell.
“He laughed,” the driver said.
This is the entertainment power of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington may determine the fate of cases such as Roe vs. Wade-precedents to reunite immigrant families and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do so, so as not to worry about these facts.
But it is no longer a part of responsible information when we stare at a debate show about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 structuring jacket (“the dress of embodied arrogance” as described by The Washington Post) or what the consequences are.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, I'm always thinking about Super Mario.
“It feels a little like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of the “Sleeping Stars.” On Trump’s show, the characters are constantly changing and new turns are coming every day (they go to N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss one part, you miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant 26 degree sunny time in Kauain, but he was still digging inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He could not break away from television as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing at the Senate Justice Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right.”

Both parties are pouring money into the tightest contests in the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties spent the money uncountably, after two active members fought for the same chair after redrawing the congressional districts.
One of the rivals for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th constituencies, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district boundaries had been manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties’ funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), were bidding almost on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the mid-March election in a tight competition in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional constituencies.
For more than a decade, Donald Trump has won the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The U.S. has been considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China and has withdrawn from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington had hardly responded to.
In June 2017, Donald Trump held talks with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization leadership team out.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recalled senior U.S. staff from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of their recent decision not to support Taiwan, a ministry spokesman said earlier.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including in the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have painfully affected the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
At the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence was also speaking, a clear indication, according to diplomats, of the importance the administration attaches to the event.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue convictions or take criminal measures.
White House spokesman John Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates whether Trump has obstructed justice in some way... and many facts have been made public.
Mueller's investigation allegedly includes whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who, after the voters, may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of insecure questions, and Trump’s fall is far from inevitable... just as it is not the case for his European comrades.
Serious decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how far the fight will go.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to assassinate Hitler, only waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The support was missed, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
At such historic turning points, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy will accelerate or slow down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been on the swing since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording conversations with the president and suggested that Trump was unfit for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported inaccurately on the events.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and, despite a credible sexual harassment charge, appoints a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question: will we vote in the interim election for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I trust it will not be so, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once sat in the building serving as an ambassador's home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a table bearing the sign of swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans at Rangers is confident before the game against Rapid Wien
The Rangers will host Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians can ensure their participation in the Group G of the European League after an unexpected draw against Villarreal in Spain.
Due to the knee injury of the midfielder Graham Dorrans, he was unable to play for the season until the 2–2 match against Villarreal, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can also set bolder goals for themselves.
“It was an important point for a great team against Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We believed that we were able to score points and we brought a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw.
They were better in the first half, and we connected to it in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their last game, but with our fans behind our backs, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys are enjoying the game, the workouts are good.
I hope that if we give it all in, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
Participants in the survey had an accurate idea of what age-related care they wanted, but only a small number spoke to their family members about it.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their elderly care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the issue,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take good care of you if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, you can choose where and what kind of care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on your future costs.
Get a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Funding can be done through a traditional old-age insurance policy, or a hybrid savings life insurance policy that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources for it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will cut the possibility of future litigation in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who will act on your behalf on health issues, supervise your medical care, and ensure that everything is done according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to manage your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and makes sure you pay your bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Let’s say that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please record this information in writing so that it is available at any time.
“It’s not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance.”
A man was shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he was on his way home after his evening program.
The victim in his 40s was attacked at Ilfracombe in Devon, Oxford Grove, where he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
The police described the shooting at around 02:30 local time as a “accidental act.”
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a major earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and a tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu.
The region's communications network has also been damaged, so no news has yet been received from the Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the centre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 residents had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
The capital of the central province of Palu, on the west coast of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
The Governorate of Donggala is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the Governorate, a smaller administrative region than the province, was about 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebs is characterized primarily by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis on several occasions over the past 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by a tsunami, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a huge sea-going wave began on the west coast of the Aceh province of North Sumatra, which launched a tsunami reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, killing more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s largest island, and the tsunami, which followed, claimed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake devastated near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-strong quake shook an island in the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra, and in some places created a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: Near-surface quake hit Aceh Pidie Jaya's governorate. The panic and devastation that ensued in the wake of her was in many ways reminiscent of the terrible tsunami of 2004.
The tsunami did not take place this time, but more than 100 people died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the earth, and thousands of tourists are stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin's son has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of having committed domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence, and resisted arrest, state police said in a statement.
According to the police report, when a lady's agent wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Prison for pre-trial detention, with a $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and replied to a question about his guilt, “He is not guilty at all.”
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, i.e. up to four years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he is also charged with a Class B violation, which could result in a one-day detention and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin is in conflict with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence and obstruction of criminal reporting, as well as possession of weapons under alcohol influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man punched him in the face.
Sarah Palint was criticized by several veterans in 2016 when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from Iraqi service.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday on the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The power supply and telecommunications systems have become inoperable, with the number of deaths likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebesh, north-east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
On social media, a number of videos of the arrival of the tsunami have appeared.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast of Palu at a ceremony, when the tsunami reached the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City, which claimed eight lives and has not been executed in the state since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving a truck rented from Home Depot on a bike ride on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, driving a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and was “intentionally” intent on causing injury, according to a statement from the prosecutor’s office in the South District of New York.
According to the document submitted, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder for extortion, which were used almost exclusively against organized crime, as well as the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditated intent,” prosecutors claim, and Saipov described it as “desperate, cruel, inhumane.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrichi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York last year demanded the death penalty for a defendant.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death for killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
In a federal case in New York City, the last execution of a death sentence was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was happy with his actions.
Said Saipov that the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea of an attack, according to the indictment.
Police said they asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovo, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
“In our view, the actual life imprisonment for confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved,” Patton says.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their defence.
Tory Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage said in a protest at the Tory conference that he would “call the army of the people into battle.”
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should feel the pressure of Euroscepticism after Theresa May’s party partner suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a non-executive conservative, told participants at the Birmingham meeting that the UK would have “left” long ago if Farage were Brexit minister.
It is a good example of the pressure within the party on May that the pro-permanent Toryk spoke at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a constant lavishness between the pro-Brexit and pro-permanent and the EU.
In spite of the negative reactions, his allies say he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can choose only among his package or “total chaos”.
Bone at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull (the exit means exiting) said that the Chequers start should be eliminated.
He suggested that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge of the negotiations, we would have quit,” he said.
Wellingborough’s representative added: “I will stick to Brexit, but the Chequers initiative has to be eliminated.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that the public mood had changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a pro-Brexit Tory representative, also attended the meeting and told the reporters: “That’s all I ask: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers initiative is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among party membership, and especially among activists who work in the field and have helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers and listen to us.”
He added: “Only the prime minister who keeps his word can keep his chair.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians “must feel the pressure” so they don’t dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, the people and our politicians, is at stake,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and today we’ve come together to send a message that we won’t let them do it.”
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We call on the people’s army to win over Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
At the same time, the pro-stayers marched to Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists flagged the “Toryk against Brexit” movement this weekend.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis was used by conservatives for security errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, an unimpeded border crossing and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren “considers carefully” to run for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would carefully consider running for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a West Massachusetts residential forum.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing to re-election in November against the state’s Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
For some time now, there have been speculations that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of voters in a residential forum since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to start the presidential election.
Warren said it was time for “women to play a role in re-establishing a misplaced government in Washington, DC, including occupying a supreme position.”
Arrested person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana said Friday they arrested a basketball player at LSU, who was suspected of shooting Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. east coast time.
Earlier, a video of the shooting on Friday was released asking for help to identify the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Sims, near Southern University’s campus, was shot dead early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shooting, which proved to be fatal,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told media representatives on Saturday, according to reports from 247sports.
Wayde intervened in the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to the interrogation that he was at the scene, had a gun with him, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without an incident, and he was arrested at East Baton Rouge police station.
At Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 matches in the last season, 10 starting points, an average of 17.4 minutes per match, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the world championship after winning a victory in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better position than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became immediately clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play a major role in the race.
Bottas, who started from pole position, started well and almost put Hamilton in trouble, as he defended his position in the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
At first, Vettel stepped into the boxing lane and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the midfield, which was supposed to be the final.
Mercedes stood out a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton preceded a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner arch free after moving twice as defensive in the third turn.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the starters, and by the end of the first round it was already seventh.
He then drove for most of the race, as he did not change tires to quickly reach the finish line and beat Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen in the hope of fourth place.
At the end of the 44th round, he stood in the boxing lane, but in the remaining eight laps he was unable to increase his pace, making Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>ne the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and she was a real gentleman when she was ordered to let her go.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting the first two seats,” Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that she did not leak the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, which accuses Brett Kavanaugh, a new member of the Supreme Court of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee, merely remarking that the things that are taking place in the Senate prove that people are “believing, hateful, and lying.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when they see anger, when they see people angry, disdainful, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak it.”
Well, let's stop for a second.
"No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to treat him confidentially and to treat him confidentially in accordance with his request.”
It seems, however, that his denial was not accepted by the president, who said at a Saturday evening meeting: “I’ll tell you what’s going on: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women by claiming that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by whatever means they may have.
They can see disbelief, disdain, they don’t care who they’re hurting, they have to run through to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the Dundee match
With his 5:3 Saturday win at Dundee, Dundee Stars competed for the defeat of the Belfast Giants at the Elite League on Friday.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants took a two-scoring lead early on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the Hungarians, and Dwyer then reinstated the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's handicap, and two of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's players in the season who beat Dundee 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 p.m. from Kendall McFaull's goal pass, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvilier doubled their advantage.
In the third round, Sullivan brought the home page back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt's pass at Cownie equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants could take the break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third.
The Hungarian team reorganised its ranks, and Bouchard again scored a human-interest goal at 27:37.
The combination of Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen take the lead to Dundee's second-third end for the first time in the game, and then took care of the victory with his team's fifth goal in the third half.
The Giants, which lost four of their last five games, returned to Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed in order to save hundreds of people on board from the earthquake
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who has lost his life while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many of them were stuck under the rubble in the town of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues had escaped after saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly bulging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pali.
He stayed there so that Batik Air’s 6,321 flight, which was already on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirai, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Paluba.
“Our hearts were troubled when we heard the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could be thousands, according to the country’s disaster relief organization, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to approach.
“The number of victims is likely to continue to increase as many have been trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves reaching six meters high destroyed Palu, where mass funerals are held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver assistance and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
There is little clean water.
The small shops were robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors in a race against time, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation tasks.
"Are you ready?" CNN reporting.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, in which more than five hundred and fifty people have died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a person is missing in a plane crash in the lagoon
An airline operating a plane crash in the Pacific lagoon, Micronesia, said a man had disappeared, although it had previously been claimed that the evacuation of all 47 passengers and crew had been successful.
According to Air Niugini’s press release, a man cannot account for a passenger on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to any additional passenger information, such as questions of age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after crashing into the flying water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing ground.
According to some witnesses, the plane took the landing route away.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others had been able to travel to the bottom of the sinking plane's emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, shipmen repairing a quay nearby also helped rescue the ship and transported people to the shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor told the defendant on Saturday at a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He told the jury how he used data from the cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of the woman's death, which contradicts the man's previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "false because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio called a negative view of the genre to the sheep by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social issues.
They want to return to these roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is he black again?
Dada in New York sues for dismissal of a party following a “racist” message
A New York nurse filed a lawsuit for the dismissal of a couple from discrimination after the mother complained in a message sent to her by mistake that they were using a “black” nurse again.
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the lawsuit to “stealing.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother with two children, expressed disappointment when, on the first working day of the new child care provider Giselle Maurice’s arrival in 2016, she saw that she was black.
“NEEEEEEM, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BLACK!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after waking up to his blunder, the self-imposed Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nurse, who was an African-American, did a bad job and was more of a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid a day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for reparation for the dismissal, and asks for a daily compensation of $350 for the six-month work he was hired to do, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the march, it can’t be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism that it was reasonable to stop using Maurice because they were afraid they could not trust him after he was offended.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone with whom, even if accidentally, he was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would anyone attack this?
“It’s not really nice to do that,” the banker added.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the public court has already quickly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a letter that has just been found, Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to imagine ourselves in the place of someone who reads for the first time before it is published.
It’s pretty fun to have this information now that we already know what a huge success Paddington is.”
He said his father, who worked as the BBC’s cameraman before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a little toy bear, would not have resented his work being rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was a bittersweet success after his father’s death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not at all conceited,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child taking something: we are proud of it, even if it’s not really our merit.
I think Paddington's success could be seen in a way like this.
Although he created it and it came out of his imagination, he always attributed it to himself as Paddington’s merit.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
On landing with his daughter, they rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“They called me regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they weren’t expecting him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I received a call from Nad in which he told me that in the next two minutes my daughter would die and I had to say good-bye.
I said goodbye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart slowly ran out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn’t leave myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others who did not care about the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I threw my head down, and my tears burst all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the plane.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew she loved my daughter very much.”
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put out postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook, and her smile caught everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always told me that his smile would put you up in any place.”
However, before his death, he gave up his work because he was “in a very bad state.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would create a domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards with the aim of “knowing people, there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t sit quietly, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who for years had lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend Mark, who had been a partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely down on Christmas Day: when the children opened their presents, he didn’t look into their eyes and that sort of thing.”
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge hole in the family.
He broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's Future as FBI Investigates
“I thought that if we could achieve what he asked for — a limited-time, limited-scale investigation — we could perhaps agree,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of “falling into pieces” because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters object to the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due only to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans are not expected to perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their men to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to make the decision to bring Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of dissidents "decreased" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszek cited data from the Southern Ministry of Unification and said that in the last year there were 1,127 dissidents compared to 2011, when that number was 2706.
Park said that closer border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for traffickers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the dissidents in the North will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them are heading towards China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China accepts dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, and their talks focused on the frozen nuclear disarmament talks.
This came at a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed on further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances it is unthinkable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" unfit for the Supreme Court
The minority president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, “hysterical” and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to his work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought unwittingly that if a woman behaved in this way at any time, I would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi explained in his response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Justice Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, heated with emotion, protested the rumors that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teenage years.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting, and his voice closed when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s democrats, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organized by angry liberals due to Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s behavior proved that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he has excluded himself from his statements and the behavior he has shown against the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he was in the position and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“All I’m saying is that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Court of Appeal of the capital.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would alter the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court and expect us to burst into joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep their hands on it.
It's a legitimate outburst, a rage accumulated for months and years comes to the surface, and you can't get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, right?”
“There was a woman who was working in a leadership position somewhere,” he continued. “She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique that, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
In part, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I began to cry in my angry helplessness, that a woman older than me — a cool manager I was always afraid of — grabbed me and took me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be satisfied because they’ve managed to upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-marriage affair at Monkey Business, and therefore dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, figured out that there was no reason why he could not run for the presidency himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted the new candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it “Hoshine and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the fundraiser, so she vowed not to compete unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He realized that some of his supporters gave men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“Did you think I would get a discount?” he asked.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, emotions were so overwhelmed by gratitude for the people who supported him, and frustration and anger over the system that made it difficult to raise money and reach voters directly, that his throat was cut short.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, referring to how the press responded.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
“Were you crying?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and while the battle was not yet nearly over, experts say the break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warnings early this year by imposing a tax on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new tariffs already affect a product worth $200 billion, effectively taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
Beijing has always cut back tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, most recently between 5% and 10%.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you wanted to get Washington to back down, that would mean you'd have to give up your waist in front of the demands, but public bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is good at tactics, the US trade war pressure could be good for China in the long run as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions that can drive any of the economies of the two countries into an economic whirlwind is far more serious than previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country that was destroyed in the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said that the state of the country is improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer thanks to the achievements in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to re-establish the integrity of areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and the self-imposed economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that there was no acceptance of conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at the Le Gold National outside Paris in a 16.5:10.5 ratio.
The U.S. has fallen for the sixth time in a row on the European stage and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, handing it over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in every corner, making him one of the four players who have ever achieved a 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was awarded 5&4 by Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, the lowest-ranking player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder-cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time with a career score of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stop.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia, who struggled with emotions, said after the European victory.
The baton is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 single on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 titles and is preceded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing results of U.S. team captain Jim Furyk’s team, he said: “You’re proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Take the hat off in front of Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, we will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to raise your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
