Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home victory at the opening - Savo Volley's second win
Hurrikaan-Loimaa, who had been on the medals of the Men's Volleyball Championship seven times in a row, started the season with the 2018-19 home victory, when Raisio Loimiu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
General player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most powerful of Hurricanes.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn’t happen, and then a call came from Loimaa.
We got things done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen played in Loimus, too, with support for Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra extra cash into the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medal pipe is, of course, a goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most powerful
Miro Määttänen was the most powerful of Savo Volley with 18 points, when the team knocked down the Vantana Ducks 3-0.
Our game was bleak, especially at the attack end, but luckily we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team,” Mätätnen said.
Antti Siltala, who started her career in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good feeling was left in the home opening.
Miro was a king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi Sammo, while Tuovinen was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most powerful Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen is once again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012–13 league spot exchange, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the opening prize of the season after losing the Tigers of Kokkola 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
Today we were close to losing, because we were in the fourth round at the loss of 17-21.
There was a win, and the fifth came at the same time,” Mikkonen said.
A few months ago, the most powerful Tigers in the finals were the 28 points scored by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
The countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland ranks number one in the world in terms of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says Lancet, a science magazine.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one statistic.
In 2016, the top scorer was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, the list found Taiwan.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked worst.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has pointed out that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Athletico in check, the local game ended with no goal.
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to the grandstands, and the Madrid local game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard, Courtois, managed to fight back.
Courtois played in Athletico for three seasons while playing for Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, FIFA elected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale scored the best goal in the real world, but his shot went past the finish line at the end of the half-finals.
After a break, Bale was switched due to a travel injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the title of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
U.S. Attacks on Abortion Law: A Powerful Document Explains Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected to the nomination of President Donald Trump’s candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh’s decisive vote will reverse a decision known as Roe v Wade that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has been over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of our country’s MPs.
Colleen McNicholas, a gynecologist, is the only abortion doctor in Missouri due to legal tightening.
The clinic’s armed guard says he’s defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
We move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Men's Association guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died from an abortion is enough.
The number of deaths in the United States was about 5,000 years ago.
The legalization of abortions was especially defended by the Republican Party.
In 1967, in California, the law on abortion was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began to invertively confuse religion with politics in favor of voters.
He was also the parent of his successor, George Bush.
Donald Trump did the same.
The document reaches the deepest point of the matter in the search for a basis for the politicisation of abortion.
When religious organizations in favor of racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
When writing this, the US is faced with a situation in which the president, who boasted with his sualine harassment but took the voices of the religious right with his abortion stance, has elected Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may be given the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border with major demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired at protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in Gaza’s border area on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded in bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an air strike in the border zone when protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it has begun to use force to prevent demonstrators from breaking down the border fence or trying to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in demonstrations in Gaza since March, when the Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 people are injured.
Protesters called for Palestinian families to have access to the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped on Palestinian kites and helium balls have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's top partner Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a rear-mounted fight in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the coat was clean.
I couldn’t believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to bother the referee, Ward, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes in jail when Santa was overthrown.
Ward showed a penalty shot, and Mario Vrancic shook the 1-0 goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship Series.
The previous was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The work tasted good again for Puk.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created paint scenes and fought tirelessly.
Norwich had a fifth match in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win tube behind it.
Pedophiles’ help service was filled immediately from reservations - in Finland about 40,000 people feel interest in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for people who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The SeriE project, jointly by the Foundation for Criminal Services and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood and appointment times were quickly booked in Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, Yle explains.
However, these will be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a shame to many.
The majority of those who see paedophile emotions in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate a normal life,” says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump won the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest winners of the prize based on betting odds.
In the background, Trump’s role in getting North Korea, at least on a speech level, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The most popular winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreans is significant, as last year the gap was still hysterical.
Yet the reward of Kim, who has been armed with nuclear weapons for years and who has led his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Winners of the Nobel Prize will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent award for peace.
If the award is not given to those involved in the diplomacy of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become the world’s leading expert in their field.
Mukwege’s work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying byproduct of many conflicts.
The United Nations Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that 331 nominees will be awarded this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump wouldn’t mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked her at the White House if she thought she deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often awarded recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and the multipolar world order – precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the award was awarded to three American politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Remuneration of Trump would therefore require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like consuls and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja on the first road took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, the tunnel area traffic was cut off both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened because there are drivers on the road sock and they drive how it hurts, the on-call firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT recently.
At the time, the highway was driven in the wrong direction only after a while.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Transport Safety, is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for compelling reasons.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, you cannot start to compromise traffic with hastened solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially forbidden, as is making and cancelling a U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where in addition, the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” says Heiskanen in a statement.
Fans of Ilves would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught in the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans, carried by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere, would have liked to remain on the ship to continue the triumph even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove away from its route late on Saturday evening and stayed on the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the buddies.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them to the port by the fire department and take the bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s buddy was due to the fact that the surface of the water in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the closest bus sign was covered with block marks, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No mention of a collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi, shortly after the ferry route had crossed the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, catching the bottom has not caused any leaks or impressions on the ship, and in this view the cruises of the ship will continue normally.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship was towed off the shallows.
To be sure, we are still going to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage,” Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, scheduled for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the cruise period of the ship will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The Rescue Department received an alert about the incident on Saturday night, shortly after noon.
Ambulances were alerted to Viila Harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Daily firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather harsh wind.
On the night before Sunday, Pirkanmaa Rescue Service announced that all passengers on board had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transported by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s Judge Candidate Accused of Harassment and Drinking May Not Be in Top Office
Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well miss the job he is looking for, says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Institute for Foreign Policy.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person in office.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for a judge has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
It would fall into the Democratic camp.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party camp in the upcoming mid-term elections of the Congress.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The nomination will not be held for every presidential term, as in the United States the Supreme Court judges will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at around 70-80 years of age.
Some Republicans have doubts about the name.
As usual, U.S. Supreme Court judges will be screened, Aaltola says.
While Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI’s further investigation, Aaltola says it can still bring up something important.
Yes, it might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are believed to be suspicious of Kavanaugh’s nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and the Republicans to lose.
Woman Recognizes Salisbury Suspected Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on the photographs, the woman said it was a military intelligence operation with Anatoli Tshepi, working in the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier that they had exposed one of the men suspected of poisoning to Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that men’s current identities were covert identities.
The BBC team travelled to a village near the Russian-Chinese border near the Far East, where Tshepi grew up.
A woman living in the village identified Tshepiga from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from British police photos featuring a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepi has been awarded the Russian Hero’s Medal of Honor in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said earlier in September in an interview with Russian TV that they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Old people throwing bags in the health care reform
Now a living example has been given of what the change limit for social reform, as defined by the Sipilä government, means in practice.
My birth municipality Vaala’s social services are produced by the Oulunkaare municipal association, whose health service director is former Regional Director of Attendo, who was elected in 2016.
Leaders of the municipal association warn about the change limiter.
If the cost of health care is increasing, the state aid will be cut in the future.
Municipal decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the inpatient care and a small unit of memory-disabled patients in the ward of the health centre.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots to be treated as "homes" next to the health centre.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left of Vaala did not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a good public event with a lot of relatives, close friends and also delegates from other parties.
I introduced to the Social and Regional Planning slides how the municipality of Vaala treats the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a local councillor, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again brought the designers of Oulunkaar to their backs.
Sote preparers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about service vouchers, but they do not tell us what level of care they will receive or what staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the end of the day.
Without a nurse?
The health centre’s facilities are closed because there is no doctor’s night care.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the stake shows how the officials in the centre run the delegates with incomplete information and the delegates are pushed back against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the centre party clears out the residents of Vaala, for who remains in it without security to live voluntarily, if there is a chance to move away.
Is there an all-embracing slogan in the centre that the whole country is considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens grand mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe’s largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the shores of the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, he read on the protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During a visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
The supporters of Erdogan had also gathered in the vicinity of the Great Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of mosques from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild their relations, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disagreements between countries on issues such as human rights.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he had joined a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that is different from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan’s German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Slovakia charges three journalists for murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by police during the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected that the murders were related to Kuciak's investigations.
The incident and Kuciak’s published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing error, Sunday’s Karelian will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in scattered areas where the distribution of co-boxes has to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra newspaper bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will interview, among others, Vesa Heilala in her upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio about her upcoming space trip, which she booked with Virgin Galactic in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight, which took place in 2014 and which required death, things are in place.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his flight will be scheduled about a year after the first departure.
The flight lasts for 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about the upcoming flight on his website.
At the same address, he also background his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Journey and saw the Star Trek series on television.
We've seen Star Wars, and that's what I thought.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a great host.
Manchester City continued its loss-free course in the Premier League when it crashed its home field in Brighton on Saturday, 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero are the guarantors of the sixth victory of the reigning champion team.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth goal of the season from a close distance to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at the back of Brighton's goal in the 30th minute.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero raised his own score to five when he and Sterling cut the Brighton defense to pieces with the 65th minute of the game.
Argentinian was able to easily place 2-0 end-reads on the penalty spot.
With six wins and one draw, City leads the Premier League with 19-point catches.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one game, is only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers for its next three-year term 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected president of Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen was elected vice-president of Häme.
The Board of Governors was elected with 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Association announced on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural pursuits to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Council in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year action goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Council says in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6> and surprised Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu was asked if she believed that releasing Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the end.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not think that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen would hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen has been one of his first images.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
“I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The race starts at 2 p.m. in Merceden Valtteri Bottas.
The evening magazine follows the moment of the race.
The football championship of the A- Youth Championship became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the round started at 13:00, the starting points for the championship competition were clear: FC Lahti Academy had enough points against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the last round, Ilves, the second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the Lahti residents.
However, the Lahtinen championship was confirmed in practice even before the start of the tournament, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player, it would not have been possible to start the match.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of the players is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-young SM-series, the P20 series and the men’s 2nd block C.
Vasa IFK has played against the fall of the season in the second place.
On Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno, according to the rescue department, luck was involved
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno at Story Varantie on Sunday at 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue service said.
Good luck, the statement said.
According to the Rescue Department, the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo is looking for new ways to reconnaissance: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments have already been carried out, activities planned abroad are not wasted
According to Supo’s chief executive Antti Pelttar, the scouts have been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million in the budget would be permanent.
The premises of the Finnish Defence Police (supon) located on Helsinki Ratakatu are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Suppo’s co-founder, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shocked by a video in which she sings in the topless - campaigns for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now he’s campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, AFP reports.
The song is the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I voted for The Divinyls’ worldwide hit to remind women to do regular self-checks,” Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of the color of the skin, anywhere in the world.
Early detection is all about a and o - it scares many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first,” Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.

The Korpelan alley runs out today: This is how it all ends
All good ends in time.
Today, the Korpela alley run, which has been quite popular, is going on in Finnish country drama.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode for the first time on television.
The peaks in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no follow-up to Heikki Luoma’s and Jukka Mäkinen’s series.
In the final period, Jaska’s and Mirku’s relationship takes another big leap forward, and I think Jaska’s mother will be the first to guess what’s to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, in the light of recent events they are quite romantic, but then once again Laiho appears in the patterns.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
Yet no one knows the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, can hear amazing news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which will bring the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings, the new episodes of Sorjonen will continue.
Korpela's all-rounder today on TV1 at 21:05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people want to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth going to infect others, as the disease can be contagious, even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear on the hive.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says Prevention.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when a person does not have symptoms.
The virus is transmitted already the day before the symptoms begin and from then on from five days to one week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when a cough stops and there is no more fever, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast a return to the gym slows down recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, put them in a handkerchief and throw the towels in the trash.
Is it painful to move?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
“You shouldn’t put your fingers in your nose or mouth,” Poland said.
Also, sneezing is limited to the mask.
How to avoid infections?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats mission tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Ice hockey players and misses are often linked together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 Miss Finland crown for her co-workers.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian, and her father is Russian.
His father’s Russianness Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for my Russianness.
I didn’t have any friends in Pertunmaa,” Alina says at the unveiling of the Miss Suomi semi-finalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the missionary found new friends and the everyday started rolling as desired.
When I was 15, I thought I was an adult, but when I thought about it afterwards, I really wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar from the Pelicans ranks.
After a career in the SM-League, a hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived for almost a year in a distance relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and make a career for me, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, our trust works well, and the good thing about the distance relationship is that it’s the initial spark that keeps us going all the time,” Alina said in a statement in May.
With continued growth, with joy, death on our knees
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s resilience.
Yet there is little to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are sought, but the theory of the economy also encounters major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought a standard of living to ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, for a few generations, from which we could only dream.
However, the long-standing overcapacity of the Earth and climate change are causing this market economy’s stone base to deteriorate threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night at the Sitrator in Kannmäki at 4 a.m.
The man who was born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and the other, born in 1968, was less severe.
The older men have already left the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing is investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect related to the incident.
Events are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Interin's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match in 1-1th grade in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and happily lifted the ball over the goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the foreign saga, the Mariehamn people reached the two points of the Turku Ball Club.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized by Mariehamn’s head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not start the fight that he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily the paint from Turku brought us more into the game.
Home team Inter's head coach John Allen said the game was in control, but the score was once again a source of pain.
One defense mistake took us to a full point, Allen regretted.
We were the best again!

The newspaper showed its underpowering skills, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä’s strong underforce game came out when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä scored Michael Raffl twice.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on the show due to drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug pools, where some are suspected of using drugs and some are involved in sales, for example.
The newspaper denied that it had committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer journalist who closely followed Flyers, said after the match that Lehterä is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom will be in the NHL.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second round Lehterä struggled with underpower, pulled the defender against him and pitched Raffli, who was waiting for the goal in front of him.
For the second time, the two teams scored at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team’s coaching leadership to decide if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of that.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” Vaakanainen said in an interview on Boston’s Twitter account.
He played for Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Vili Saarijärvi, a flyback defender, scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team defeated Toronto 5-1.

New Image Shows Change: World's Strongest Man Loses Ten Pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, is undergoing a spectacular transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the world’s strongest man for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories a day and weighed 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were 5XL in size.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing harm to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for the world's strongest man victory by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram in which he poses his active career in a much slimmer condition.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kg.
Hall wrote that he is now training five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was Haf<0xC3><0xBE><0xC3><0xB3>r J<0xC3><0xBA>l<0xC3><0xAD>us Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rnsson, who is also familiar with the TV series Game of Thrones.

Restaurant ship M/S Tampere rushed to the karle in Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly stuck on a rock"
Inland watercraft M/S Tampere ran late Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The Rescue Department received an alert about a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past twelve.
The 30-metre-long ship M/S Tampere has crashed and is firmly attached to its bow on a rock,” Matti Willman, chief firefighter, said in a statement.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, the day-to-day manager Jari Nieminen told STT after 1:00 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to Viiala Harbour to receive evacuated passengers.
From Hämeenlinna to Tampere, the ship had, for some reason, drifted away from its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police will find out the cause of the incident.
Daily firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather harsh wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently the ship doesn't leak.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check what is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is currently a restaurant vessel with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-Managers Demand Unpaid Rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius’s fight against Erkan Teper is a shadow of money dispute.
Tonight evening Sanomat reported on a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkola, in which Helenius receives unpaid manager fees of over 80 000 euros, including interest on late payments.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to reconcile, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done,” Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomi.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the Evening Journal, explaining the events in the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies the obligation to pay the required amount.
According to Vastinen, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was literally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly, it was assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only receive the income they arranged for him.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on wage work, and it would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius,” Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Vastinen, Helenius would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he said the proposal was poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never once had a relationship with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an “unidentified but substantial” decline in the work of the manager.
This year, the same claims have been raised.
Helenius considers the subsequent activities of Helminen and Kokkkila to be cowardly, the reply states.
Today, Helenius meets the IBF heavyweight challenger list at Erkan Teper in Stuttgart, the seventh in the IBF heavyweight series.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-range radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The runner’s death notice was published in the Sunday Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement states that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
She said she had said goodbye on Facebook earlier, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a well-respected person with fast hookers and fun stuff.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehousekeeper.
We met Erk then.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I progressed to making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor at every party doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable, and I saw how big a fire he had on entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got directly into the skin of her interviewees.
He was a very kind man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärki in Fazer record label in addition to his journalistic work.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work, in which he had a unique style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and became known to numerous listeners at Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The Alliance describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full translation", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in balance sheet".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning and financial management of our operations has been disrupted throughout our organization, Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and in addition, the return on world cups was maximum in the past competition period.
However, in the future, the management of costs must also be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the back yard of the hospital Please in town on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of the people in the hospital area was a 52-year-old pal, Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the yard of the Army Hospital in Palu, Dwi Haris lay, who has suffered injuries to his back and arms.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the start of the earthquake.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I was probably crushed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
“I hope they are safe,” Haris told AP.
Small shops are being robbed
At the evacuation center, the 35-year-old baby’s mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her hot baby.
He described the atmosphere as tense in the city.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many Please residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo lodges.
Even if the house was somehow erect, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners who were in prison, please, escaped after the walls of the prison collapsed.
It is estimated that there were about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were enraged and set on fire in prison after the guards had ordered them not to go looking for their relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first, an army C-130 transport plane landed on the ground, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow limited access to the airport.
The pilots have to land on the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, a long rainy area spreads from the west, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain mostly comes in the form of water, but we can expect to see snow or snow in central and northern Lapland.
The frosts of the night before are not repeated, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control quite effectively.
In the west, you can temporarily visit the side of the frost,” said Ville Ilkka, an on-call meteorologist.
On Sunday, the rainy area will retreat eastwards during the morning.
In the south and west there are pores or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures are moving up to the height of Oulu at 10-13<0xC2><0xB0>C.
The initial week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave alarms are in place in marine areas.
There are no actual autumn storms to be expected in the coming days, but otherwise there will be a typical autumnal variable weather.
“It’s autumn that’s starting to get serious,” Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final is not on TV.
On IL-TV you can follow the red carpet glamour and telegram of the Miss Suomi competition.
On IL-TV, the entertainment editors of Iltalehti pull live broadcasts from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from Billnäs square.
The broadcast will start at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday with ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs Square in Raasepori.
Before the start of the final, you can watch the atmosphere on the spot on IL-TV live stream.
The live broadcast starts at about 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a lot of Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, the well-being entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni Kauppi Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen from Seiska.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the mission.
Russian father Dimitri and Indian mother Svetlana believed in the success of their daughter in the Miss Suomi final.
The parents of the new Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed her daughter’s first moments at the end of the crown.
They were sipping in the audience from Pertunmaa and were planning to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erik all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get tense, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that as a child Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty she had to be a missionary.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
The parents’ wish was for Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Suomi competition.
That was the case, and in the end, Alina still wanted to do a bachelor's degree before the missions.
Last year, we asked him why he didn’t participate, but he wanted to finish that entry.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He plays a lot of sports and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be on the show, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing hockey in Japan, and he couldn’t get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between young people will last a mission year.
Yes, that is the intention!
My parents wanted my daughter to visit soon.
It's been such a long break from the visitation because of the missions.
I'm sorry, even though there's been messages.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband once gave me a speech in which he suggested it to the story I developed as a person, says the Estonian comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator in Brussels for economic and legal affairs until after her fourth child, the family became a return immigrant ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I remembered what I would do when I was a big child.
Then in 2014 came a comic.
Pippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix from a young age.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these organic manuscripts started to come into being, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawing artist, but I couldn’t get her involved until summer 2016, when I donated Viivi using a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strippers, and then I had to start trying for myself, laughs Piippo, who says that the record was a great incentive for him.
A hard drive is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper,” Piippo tells about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
The scripts are constantly popping up, but usually I don’t make them all at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the current comics of the newspapers, including Scott Adams’s Dilbert.
The members of the organic hut are an L-themed reindeer mother with a salad-hairy softness.
Other people include the Man, the Piss and the Twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a forced bull, even though the organic burrows sometimes get in the way of things.
Piippo says he reads his series with his husband and children.
After all, it’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’re drawing and say that’s what I’ve done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe
Indonesia’s hero of the earthquake is 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthony Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely transport a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake-affected island.
The young man was in charge of the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city, please, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
When the others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to control Batik Air from the passenger jet runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was watching and cracking.
Eventually Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the arrival of the helicopter, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight was released into the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered over Europe’s end to the trade war: “We need to look at the next tweet.”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director-General Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first meeting that, while the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is still a great place to play.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation also with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the market reacted harshly to the Italian Government's clear presentation of the deficit budget on Thursday night.
Next year’s deficit will be more than 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loan stock is problem loans and more than ten per cent of unscheduled loans are unscheduled loans.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to again exceed its commitments in relation to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet another crisis, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead to a new economic crisis in Europe.
Another problem facing Europe is the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
The difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just over a year.
The debate about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have been eloquent in the speeches.
“I don’t care if Finnish names are included,” Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further on the matter.
HS’s super-popular Black Box shows will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the week beginning.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale at the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage tell a long-prepared true story that has not been published in any HS medium before.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe, and a telling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing the evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the museum.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring season 2019 Black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also be held in Tampere and Turku.
At the time, the presentation will have a different content than in this autumn evenings.
The missing mushroom maker was found thanks to a "pre-cautionary experiment"
Finnish police’s drone expertise is at the top of the world: “We’re being questioned about trainings”
According to the head of the University of Applied Sciences, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the missing sponger in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, head of the University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and said, among other things, that “through unprecedented experimentation and effective education, we are also the world’s leader here.”
Drone is quite a new cape, and even more so in police duties.
There is no record that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We are asked about training.
Increasingly
Himberg points out that finding lost in winter conditions in Finland is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, lost was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are supposed to be trained more.
Already now, the drone is being used a lot in police missions, and its use will become more widespread and increasing in the future.
That’s what I’d say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones for accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence.
For example, it is already necessary to check a region a little further away, which may be feared that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary inquiries.
Karjalan Rugby takes first place
Karelian Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and cleared the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-Division Championship was known to Karelian Rugby for its historic rise to 1-Division.
In the past, the club played in number one, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM-series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to take over the show, but it will know a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be raised to 25.
The 1-Division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi begins season in Montreal, strengthens head coach
Montreal Canadiens coach Claude Julien confirmed on Twitter that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise to Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with the number three at the summer booking event.
The attacker joined the Montreal training force in the late summer and has presented strong points in the September training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score in his first training match.
The head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big development steps after arriving at the new camp.
The NHL's frame series will start on the night of next week's Thursday.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with HS, Nokia’s Chairman of the Board Risto Siilasmaa told about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but even in previous Nokia reports, there has been talk of managers’ inability to act as a team; fear and inability to speak, which in part caused the mobile business to collapse.
The risk-taking and agility of the company’s boom phase disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum also held a business giant event in Helsinki during the week, which attracted the Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world rose to the stage.
We had enough talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel said that a good leader should have the courage to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally connected to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods chain, which is known for its wide range of organic products, said the manager must be able to communicate with the entire staff about the company’s purpose.
And that can't just be about making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of Introverts for the Book of Success, said the most successful leaders have been shown to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
Growing up, a company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
At the Nordic Business Forum, 7,500 visitors listened to these lessons - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A good leader is required.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other comradely in the scenes.
However, they did not wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrives on a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
The model Sara Chafak arrived in the final in a gorgeous black dress.
In 2012, Miss Finland’s spectacular dress also had a lace lava.
It's a bit of a pod jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there,” Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for a test shot.
He has, among other things, done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also as similar to that in Finland.
However, he says that the work needs to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives 30,000 Euro Live Art Award in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a prize worth 30,000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating on the field of live art.
Danish police found a large Volvo in operation: “We can’t tell you where.”
Large-scale searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the <0xC3><0x98>resund and Iso-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from Själlan Island were closed to Sweden, Germany and other parts of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
He reached the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We found the car we were looking for.
We can't tell where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm, in a statement from the Copenhagen police, told Ilta-Sanomi.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Denmark's Extra Bladet told police about Saturday's news conference.
Investigator J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me which criminal code to investigate.
Skov said it was a “serious crime.”
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police don't know if they've already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
STT says, however, that the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat targeted certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote on it in controversial elections
A new name for the country is currently being voted on in the Balkans in Macedonia.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote began at least with a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
That means a change, especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 1991.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is enough to stress whether the turnout exceeds the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
Nice win!
Robert Helenius slams Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the Intercontinental title match of the IBF heavyweight series.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to take on more difficult tasks, which are of considerable economic importance, as seen on Saturday.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper with a loud left-handed blow.
Teper was no longer able to get out of the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" injured its opponent in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to fight already in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had been beaten twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton to win with a stable order - the difference I already wagered 50 points
The Formula One championship was once again approaching its fortification, as Mercedes-Benz Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup lead to 50 points (306-256) at Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position of the race, drove second.
Last year, Bottas, who had won the opening prize in Sochi, held a leading position near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was the fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu, caught a block away.
Two men assaulted, beating and kicking 31-year-old Yukalaism in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also grabbed the victim’s phone.
The police reached the suspect, a 35-year-old man in a haystack and a 39-year-old man in Ilmantsi, shortly after the event.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock market.
The SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement on Nafta with the US
In the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada, the free trade agreement on Nafta is threatening to end.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada’s prime negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (FTTA) in Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans are being made to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were spelled fire in Kaakkuri - the fire brigade was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
Tens of rescue units were alerted because of a possible block fire.
On the spot it was found that candles burned in the apartment building sauna had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which is why the emergency centre had been informed.
There was no fire at the site.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - raiding the airport and metro station
Police arrested 11 people after the men's football league Honka-HJK match in Espoo on Saturday, police commissioner Teemu Värtininen confirmed to STT.
The basis of the attachment was protection against crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
He told me earlier about the evenings.
The match ended with 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large group of spectators rushed to the field from the auditorium reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to push and fist fights between the supporters of the teams.
Among other things, cavalry officers were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, the crash took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the captures were also carried out.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the rampage on the ground.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Table stone shocked the butterfly in the SE World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Stone have reached the finals on the closing day of the World Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
You can swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS table stone was horrified by Finland’s record in the 50-metre butterfly, where he was the second in the early days of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone was swimming in Helsinki during the SE season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen from Cetus, Espoo, was 24th in the butterfly shower during the time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was in the early stages of the 50-metre breaststroke in the sixth period of 30.48 and progressed to the final.
In the early days of the two hundred-metre secession, Laukkanen was 15th at 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects with its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sophocleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour starting from the National Theatre the only surviving drama trilogy of antiquity, Aischylos Oresteia.
In the Lavat Open! projects, which started in 2015, the actors of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional instructor internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oreste was held in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s settlement of Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the blood collection of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law for twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the chorus parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonhus’ fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and a display that reveals the sides of the theatre space highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is alternately on the dynamics between the actors who leave the choir, who play the name roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple interpretations of the name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and Kassandra, who returns to the war hall, are shown on the stage, contrary to the ancient tradition of performing.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, in front of the eyes of the viewer, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of actors from the Master’s phase as a close group, as a single organism.
Especially in chorus parts, actors who are inclined to very expressive, sculptural group formations can get their rights on the stage with a bare, only white curtain.
Impressive.
Orestea’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen vacuum cleaner
The new concept is beginning to emerge in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyundai and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, Hyundai will supply a thousand-car series of new models for the Swiss company and its partners.
With the introduction of a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues on the road as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer for the Nexo and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this kind of first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network,” In Cheol Lee, vice president of Hyundai Motor, said at the announcement of the agreement.
Wrestling in Kajaani on several occasions
A little over thirty men assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, and as a result, he was removed.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser hit him too.
The police arrested the attacker.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and murder.
The man was taken to the jail to calm down.
Three assaults and violent opposition by an official are being investigated.
Another assault occurred in the centre of Kajaani on the middle of the street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who had hit him before kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the attackers away from the victim and the police called.
However, the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone +358 295 416 520 or by e-mail to kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle’s long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is on now.
The doctor also said that, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening newspaper a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I was hired for the first time in 1984.
When these year-round rings make a story stand out, it’s usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, working environment expert at the Finnish Association of Service Industries (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers are of course saying otherwise.
The police are only aware of clearly identified cases of serious violence and many real situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to report their near-miss situation on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not come to the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
However, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must also count as violence - even if there is no access to them.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
With the release of the opening hours of the stores, the media’s visible buzzing was quite large in terms of its impact on the safety of the sellers.
“At that time, many employers arranged security services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, due to the security, the disturbances remained well in control, the impression arose that the security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been abused does not want to make an inquiry about a criminal who usually lives near the market.
But according to the same paragraph of the 2011 law, mild abuse becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
If justice put a few inmates in jail, and the sentence from there on the hard end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed to Miss before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of Missis is not seen on TV as usual this year, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The show is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives that the broadcast was going on.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this man-in-law of ours, Sohlberg agitated his colleague with the cheer of the audience.
Miss Finland will follow many of the leading competitions in the previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg looked at Saroi.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siep, who laughed at the comment, even though at first it seemed confused.
Sieppi spoke about his divorce for the first time in the Evening-Sanomies Weekend Magazine.
She said she did not want to open up the reasons for the difference in public, as it is a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
He said that he was not in a hurry to have a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I’m focusing on my own stuff, and especially I’m starting to live my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula’s marriage status was revealed at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The three of them laughed.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed the mokan.
Groundman tortured his tied mates by cutting, burning and feeding powerful sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for a crime committed against his multiple unmarried partners.
Among the offences were the belt, cable and bundle ties.
The court condemned these items to be lost to the state.
The crime was against a suspect in aggravated rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the District Court.
The cause of the Kokkola was four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of his last actions, he was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia passed its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivation of liberty and the violent rape of May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as unsubstantiated by the court.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to lose the instrumentalities: belt and cable, bundled ties, bathrobe belt, knife and vest.
Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
You can read from the sentence that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the criminal episode.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old victim must be compensated for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm by a total of EUR 5800.
He hardly has the money in question, since the sentenced person already has debts in the recovery.
The prison sentence is not the man’s first.
The newspaper does not mention the name of the convicted person in order to protect the victim's privacy.
The new ruling is not valid when writing this.
Europe in four-point lead to Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup in Paris with a score of 10-6, while twelve doubles will still be played on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of Saturday’s four-ball games, and in the afternoon’s four-ball game the winnings were levelled 2–2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the Europeans had done the same.
On Sunday, the two are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and the Americans have achieved none other than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the fierce harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, HJK released a statement condemning its supporters for their disorderly behaviour at the FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field, and some seemed to be trying to challenge Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
Police officers and cavalry officers were not able to calm the situation.
In a statement, HJK said the team’s players and officers were shocked by what happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We will be very clear about any action that endangers the security of the match," the statement said.
HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in investigating security threats and eliminating mild phenomena.
Supporting culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, joyful and encouraging action in football spectators.
“Violence is not part of it,” the statement said.
Philippine inventor flies in a drone car - how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group around the world who swears he invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, he has spent much of his wealth building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he has made the first successful test flight - he was flying on his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago,” Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: tomorrow’s work-fighting activities will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
Overtime and shift bans starting tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors are particularly visible in social and health services and day care for children, says JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The impacts will be wide-ranging, and they will certainly be visible in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how they are looking for their children.
The employer’s job now is to make sure that the services are playing and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the low number of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for employees not to be hired, but employees to work overtime or change shifts.
This is not a labor struggle yet.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is the norm for every employee to take care of their regular working hours and only to do them.
JHL opposes the government’s intention to reduce the risk of dismissal of small businesses.
Labour market leader Markku Jalonen does not undertake a prior assessment of the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The region is so vast, social and health care activities and technical sectors that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences of the corresponding three-day-long activities of the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and the Social and Health Care Trade Union Tehy, among others.
Their effects were quite limited.
JHL’s overtime and shift ban applies to employees in municipalities, church, state and private social and health sectors, among others.
For example, child care providers are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100,000 JHL members are involved.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The Federation has also prepared for other labour-fighting measures if the preparation of the Termination Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is a wall and a hard one.
According to Jalos, both the ay movement and the government must come against it.
What’s special about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is born with the power of children and adults - in the performance's fitness districts, the gestures of a rausku and a seahorse are studied
In other premises, the Great Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the exercises of the beginning.
There is also plenty of fairy-tale magic for children’s participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance made by adults and children in co-operation.
It provides adults with information and perceptions of children’s way of receiving information and making art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of satubalette, fitness and nature-related information, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the business lines of corals and coral reef living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness districts teach, among other things, the gestures of a rausku and a seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the Great Coral Reef who observe the life of the Coral Reef as well as the corals that are being looked at.
There are also coral-looking organisms.
The eyes and observations pointing in many directions make the performance dense and life-creasing.
Whether it is a landscape of an organism, an organism that looks at the landscape, or another organism or landscape that looks at the organism, and all of this at the same time.
It doesn’t seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group strives with its exercises to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration will be held at Sitratori on behalf of the endangered corals.
Devastation beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, though it may be difficult to comprehend the significance of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including through political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, whose wonder and play makes room for them.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do too.
I was shocked when my friend told me that she had to pick up her fifth-grade sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn’t imagine my own sister in the same situation because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that you shouldn’t touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure that friends create.
I constantly see younger and younger girls on Instagram who have makeup on their face and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send revealing images.
It's even harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad I didn’t have smartphones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities have told the government that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces visited to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the investigation into Helme by Airisto is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime.
The information on anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily seen as an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here,” Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s information, so far, no evidence of a link to national security has been found in the seized material, but the investigation is only beginning.
There is no way of knowing what can be revealed there, says one of the interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a purely financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the magazine compiled a story that discusses the allegations both for and against.
Video: The Dream Paint Saves Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool’s 100 percent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a happier team for a 1-1 draw on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, just over a year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge, Manchester lost 1-0 visitors.
At that time, Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager J<0xC3><0xBB>rgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started out stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone at his own field end.
Chelsea, for its part, had a nice league cup away from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got up from the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played ball in a small space with three-player Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombarded the perfect left leg in the back of the bet.
Pool's brass guard, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight and couldn't get his finger in the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position slightly unfair, as almost immediately after, Antonio R<0xC3><0xBC>diger threw Mo Salah from the finish line.
In the second episode of the series, the Chelsea Vessari Kepa took action.
The Basque watchman quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the tortoise into a corner kick.
On the other end, Alison zeroed in on the passing of Hazard.
The best place for visitors came in 72 minutes after James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star’s push was directed towards the national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts’ lead.
It didn't last for the 89th minute, either, when exchangeman Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
In a clock transfer discussion, the potions are deep
I remember when, a few decades ago, a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in my mind: the end of the Nen.
Some of the surnames have a nen-terminal and some of them do not.
You can be born anywhere, and here's a tray.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock shift is being phased out.
A lot of people agree that clock movement twice a year has been a fool’s job and caused a lot of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even if it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide what time it will end up in: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
You can also get people to say their opinion on the otantakanata.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is intensely held at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being and summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor pursuits and therefore on well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to studies, the morning light rhythmizes a person’s day and gives a sense of refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people’s movement outside and provide better opportunities for autumn gardening, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for the hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but the bad thing about our location in the north of the planet is that we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
What is typical of the debate on the subject is that one’s own point of view is driven and the other’s point of view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opposing party are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of powder.
The subject is extremely easy to argue about, because it does not require much effort, and there is enough mutu-feeling to justify it.
Similar types of issues are generally challenged more sharply and equally infertilely.
It’s a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it will also adapt.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life seems to be running out of time.
Josba fought for a sniper's foreign victory
Josba's first guest game in Divar produced three full-score points against Nurmo's Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki to win 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) with him.
Nurmo led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In the 50.47 period, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 win.
Both teams played crucial minutes on the ice shelves.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was also a firepower when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1+0) also played his goal in the second chain at the time of his birth.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th Anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
The burning of the Church of Perseverance a week ago was a shock.
The church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place of celebration.
Although no one would like to do so, the church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Parish Council.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the localities and other associations of the world.
Family Mass begins at the church of Eno today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move to the parish hall next to the Karelian table.
There are all kinds of things in and out of the program throughout the day.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of the retired, Ari Räsänen, who served as the church master for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the church also marks the end of an era.
The church building, which was built in 1982, is already out of use, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in a standstill in a former municipal building,” says Kappalainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from Tesla’s head of government speech – Fraud charges agreed for $40 million
Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, have agreed on a legal case with the SEC, the US securities market regulator.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being cut off from the company he founded.
Musk will continue to be Tesla’s CEO.
Musk will be forced to resign from Tesla’s chairmanship for three years.
The company has to hire a chairman of an external board.
Musk is also under tighter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and monitor Musk’s communications more closely in the future.
Tesla and Musk will also pay $20 million ($17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, CEO of SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding was secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tv was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential financiers of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from continuing to run listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge alarmed investors, and Tesla’s stock went down sharply.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, according to AFP.
The number of fatalities is expected to increase as the damage is being investigated.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
A Friday earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the town of Please on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning was issued about the tsunami immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, from the Request.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to be dead.
Ironic aid requests
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived today in the area of destruction, urged soldiers to continue their rescue work without exhausting day or night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where it is believed that there are still 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Department, said that one person was found alive at night in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which was favored by business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the quake and tsunami area would quickly require heavy clearing equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you guys in and around.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of harassers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the application’s encryption.
Interferences have been made available, among other things, to ministerial telephone numbers.
This was an application used in the British Conservative Party’s party meeting in the government.
For example, the Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of app encryption, the audience had access to the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The public could access profiles using a politician’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging into the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson's profile photo into a porn photo and title offensive for a while.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by the image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign in to other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
You can then view the profile person’s contact information and send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant’s phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The UK ICO supported the leak.
The application was developed by Australian Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, a large number of Polish people are in attendance at The Wall Suomi.
Spectacular viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The U.S. format The Wall, which spread rapidly around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Nelose last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is shot in the same studio in Poland, where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-meter-high gaming wall of the format required space for the farm.
During the start-up period, the audience of the programme was raised on social media, which was drawn into Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of the four domestic programmes, explains the matter to the evening newspaper.
He tells us that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish spectators.
The audience is made up of international contributors in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the The Wall episodes that are being filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that following a game in itself is not so difficult, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in the foreign-language studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simultaneous interpretation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap they throw there, for example, and what the situation is going on,” Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff and his colleagues were recently engaged in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland’s photography in Finland a few years ago.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of Sormune.
Japan’s southern typhoon is moving towards the main islands, authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the death toll so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and more than 300,000 households have lost their electricity.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are stopped in some places because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka at half-day’s time in Finland.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there is also a lot of wind and rain.
Trains are cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to regulators, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces is still dark
The early days of the aces have been bad.
The sky was almost dark when the team lost to Vaasan Sport on Saturday with 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Poris now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points from six rounds.
None of the Ace Defenders or two lower-chain players have scored yet.
Pressures are also increasing all the time.
When the game was almost half over, the audience stopped playing against the sport.
Six games have just been played and there is no reason to give up.
We have to worry about it, because we played so poorly.
In particular, the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the effects 1+2 for <0xC3><0x84>ssi, told me.
Of course, the sport won.
The team had a game on Friday, so it would have been visible.
Maybe it was visible, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
Mother of the Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders at the audience of the event in the big hall.
Somehow he thought that maybe not so many people would come this year,” Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the SM-competitions of the Tractor Ticket were held at the same time as the Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of visitors could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were blocked well before ten, the sellers said the products had run out, the news porridge was sold more than 500 servings, and Hyvärinen heard a rise in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, there was a particularly large number of programs for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record-high spot.
In addition, Hyvärinen expects to reach the event even further.
Every year, sellers also turn to Liper from a larger area.
This year almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived to the bread keeper.
Mother of the Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
There were 11 different types of bread in the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the martini pie shop.
7 x The most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without getting tired of your eyes.
Good lighting is well worth it.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux’s Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more the years are behind.
With enough light, you can help with the problems that come to many with age, as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As parents, the need for light also increases.
Sixty-somethings need three times more light than twenty-somethings.
Therefore, it is advisable to harvest the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniemi tipka.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
At this moment, the decorator can afford to choose.
The popularity includes an elusive japandi style that combines Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has risen to a boom.
Authenticity fascinates me in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a custom-made, even bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
Not necessarily the latest trend light, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, corrugated and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year,” Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
Kooko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads split.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League matches in orange ink with no power points,” KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period that lasted until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played at the KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
We don't know yet about O'Donnell's new club.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic is switched to paper
The game company Pelimies now recycles not only games, but also packaging materials.
The products of the Stone Foot Shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All packages that come to us go for re-use.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used,” Ville Puurula of Oulu’s Gaming Man says.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Plastics should be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving to recycling material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It is not a big problem to start recycling.
It also provides economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimeister’s operations, as in addition to new products, the main product range of the store includes used games and equipment.
Every fashion-conscious purchase: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in a suit like a suit.
With their multi-functionality, they form the basis of a good wardrobe, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes the Black Pole.
A black knit with natural materials on the hems cannot have an error.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tylon skirts and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a sloppy style around it.
The Pooloneule is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look is created from gold-brown and wide-gloss locust trousers, black poloneule and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, a blue-green scotch skirt and wine-red capepers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring a black polo knit to the edge by combining it with casual trendy outfits: denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The Soviet Security Service’s agents in the western KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, according to the archive manager Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004), who had fallen west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The destinations included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired for the DRG groups uniforms and accessories for cover operations for the Bundeswehr, railways, game keepers and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up inspection stations from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid the sabotage groups in the field of supplies with mines, explosives, lighters and means of communication.
In 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, and the mine exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reach four drunken drivers in the county at night
The police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old contiolahti man blew 1.57 pounds.
He drove at half past four at the beginning of the Kajaani route, carrying two passengers.
At four o’clock in the night, a 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew 1.54 mil, according to police.
He didn't get any serious injuries when he got out.
A 20-year-old man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew an alcometometer of 1.33 prom.
Police suspect that these male drivers are drunk and that Polvijärvi’s driver is also at risk of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van at the intersection of <0xC3><0x96>ll<0xC3><0xB6>läntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara blew 0.52 promille.
He's suspected of drunk driving.
The police are asking for observations of the stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in the parking lot with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The dark-haired suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jackets left Ratapihankatu in a dark farm car immediately after the stabbing.
One of the suspects left Humalistonkatu by bicycle in the direction of the city centre.
A pedestrian died after freezing under a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident took place after 4 a.m. on Raumantie at Niitumaa.

Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, head of sports at Hämeenlinna’s HPK, says that Filip Riska (central) has played an important role in the team’s start-ups, underforce play and defensive role in the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue to play at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
Experienced Riska, 33, success in the roles offered to him convinced the board of directors.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underforce and in the defensive role of the fourth field.
While there is still room for improvement, it’s good for the young team to stick to such an experienced player, says Mika Toivola, head of sports at HPK.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska rises when playing the Liiga ice hockey solution games.
Riska, a central striker from Pietarsaari, has previously played in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Oskari Lehtinen, an attacker, was left without an agreement after the trial period.
The real story on TV today: the climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man’s own experience.
The film was made based on them.
Everest is getting its premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri’s 2015 guidance tells about a survival battle that has been treated with grain.
Films and documents have been made about the tragedy before.
Real events are also discussed in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as the weather guide.
The life of Weathers could be saved by an eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, and therefore the conquest of the top had to be skipped.
Rob Hall went on his way and never came back.
However, the weathers struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he was lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn’t believe in survival.
Weathers were left to die.
As if by a miracle, he could still get on his feet and find the others.
The worst-burned Weathers were thought to be still dying, and once again he was left on his own luck.
It is clear that, contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given enough help.
Beck Weathers stars as Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church of Eno.
Eno’s 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday in honor of the anniversary.
The party began at 10 a.m. in Eno Church Hill at the family fair, after which the Karelian table was offered at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Eno's Lord of the Church Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time and will give strength to the work,” Rautavuori (pictured) says.
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Attraction, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the church of Eno.
The church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Evangelical Lutheran churches in Joensuu, after the destruction of the Church of Attraction in the fire.
The church was built in 1770.
In the morning, a prayer was held at the risk of agitation, in which the church, which was destroyed by fire, was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medici flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-like autumn storm swept from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather alert to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato, Corinth, instead of a street, due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused intense seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission invites you to follow the weather reports and the instructions of the local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicacan, brings with it heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to CNN, according to a 2011 study, medics occur only once or twice a year around the world, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northwards towards Europe.
Refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos, have also been a cause of concern in Greece.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
In the summer, areas destroyed by wildfires will also be under the storm in Athens.
In Greece, my meds also raged last November.
We don’t have to go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule – thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea will be cancelled and while walking, you should be careful not to throw branches or other bulk on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece during the weekend.
The instructions will be needed, as even the storm of Zorbas, which has reached its fright, is predicted to sting the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can reach up to 45 metres per second.
The harsh rains increase the bad weather.
According to tour operators, all those travelling to Greece via Sun Trips and Tui who have reported their phone number have been warned of severe winds by SMS.
The sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in solar travel communications, by the beginning of Saturday, the resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and increased according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we're monitoring the situation all the time.
Security is ahead.
I supported media assistant Antonia Schroderus, who says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
There are currently more than 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, the sun had blinked and the temperature was 27 degrees Celsius, says Ikonen of the Sun Trips.
Zorbas is expected to become the next Turkish rickety, albeit slightly relaxed.
In case of this, we have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya on Tui, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussi have identical evening dresses in the MissiFinal - this is how they react to the situation
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a gorgeous dress for this evening,” Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the host Shirly Karvinen.
The two of them also noticed the same outfit and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomi that he was in a hurry to get ready, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet runner in the MissiFinal, and talks about the stars on the front row.
Hussi has a fresh move behind him as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday.
I’m going to stay there for now, see what happens.
What is important is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was great, I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected curious glances from pensioners
The host and Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told me that she had enough to do with radio lines and Love Island Finland photography on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final.
There has been enough hurry even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the final directly from Finnair flight.
I made and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says that she has pulled out her makeup among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says that he enjoyed washing Love Island as a Finnish host.
He also said that his experience has been halted so far.
Karvinen said he had visited the show on Friday.
In some ways, it's really raw.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program singles.
How do I wear over-the-counter boots?
Three Perfect Example Costumes
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season in a suit like a suit.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can fit in.
A few years ago, the over-the-top boots that became the hitchhikers of the autumn and winter seasons have not gone anywhere.
According to its name, boots that reach the knee repeat in style from year to year and from season to season.
The handsome boots share the opinions of the users, but a bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
Over-the-top boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it’s tail, lace, duvet or tricot, the boots’ simple leather or artificial leather surface works.
The long boots look great in festive looks as well as everyday clothes.
Black over-the-ear boots are perfect for delicate outfits.
They perfectly balance the femininity of a pink, flowery pleated skirt and a delicate, bumpy knit.
A fresh yet autumny stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-inspired outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvety fabric, over-the-ear boots, eye-catching earrings and a staple bag.
While there is a certain sophistication in the over-the-counter boots, they are also perfect for a casual everyday life together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cape.
It’s so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars are starting to operate in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers aboard, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring it is planned to start traffic in the area with a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilotes robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment shows how robotic cars can cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars are completely automatic in other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always ensured by an auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with several sensors and assess whether the road is free.
If not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake has been detected, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for robot traffic development.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers aboard.
Robotic car stops are identified by parking markings.
The number 1 stop in Otakaare is the safest way to get there.
Mokoma bassist fell off stage in the middle of the show and was injured
The Mokoma band announces on their Facebook page a surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The performance of the Mokoma band at Tampereen Pakkahuone got a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped from the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The spider's wrist was broken.

Last night, Santtu stumbled from the stage at Pakkahuone in the last song and broke his wrist.
We wish you a quick recovery for your metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done with a backup, the pages read.
Mokoman fans respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist-Santtu lays gypsum in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was a bit of a concern that how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones will improve with time.

And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but do you promise to leave out such a strong drama about ending the gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police oversee hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The East Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police officers said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and authority of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected with a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who did not have the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were blown by the police, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine proceedings, police once.
In conclusion, hunters adhere very well to the promise of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter said, “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits.”
The Police Department of Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkey’s refugee camps to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police involved.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) will first select people in particularly vulnerable situations.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some are left uninvited for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with Turkish Minister of the Interior S<0xC3><0xBC>leyman Soylu and non-governmental organisations at the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 years for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement on raising it in the government.
The Coalition has supported the increase in the quota, but the last time the project has fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first one during this government term that the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (cook) and Paula Risikko (cook) were able to move to their new posts before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hawks - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article came to the conclusion that the draft law basically prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by the decrees of the ministries as production animals, pets or other business activities.
Therefore, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being a law, that is to say, we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits actions that endanger the security of society or good manners.
In principle, a ban on all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being imposed.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been passed.
In general, the Government’s activities in the drafting of the law have been weak.
Now, if we go on the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act does not require an update.
But this kind of legislation does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but perhaps it will approve such a 'everything is forbidden, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately' procedure.
I hope there will be a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be charged in case of storm
The storm of Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned on Saturday, especially sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece, writes CNN T<0xC3><0xBC>rk.
A tropical storm is said to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
The disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure that the internet is working so that people can get current status updates, says local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and, for example, to move garden furniture away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rainfall and wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, red weather warnings
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather alert to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were asked to follow the weather reports and local authorities’ instructions.
A while ago, when I got in touch, the wind was blowing hard and it was raining.
The people were calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui Travel Agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, ships in several ports did not operate on Saturday, according to local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies were told to STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather will be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen crystallised the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen admitted that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard on the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to sink into the panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not about anything huge.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend, so far, but they were just too fast, driving fourth and clearly left with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked him why the sudden fall from the Mercedes was due.
They seem to go faster than us - it's that simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, rare delicacies were seen in the future stable of Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen with Ferrari in the next season, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final season.
Sweden’s 10th place of departure is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session there were as many as five drivers who did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the Raiders in the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were at the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
Next year there will be a different story, so let’s see, let’s see.
Robert Helenius called Erkan Teper "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper at Stuttgart night was smooth.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly more far-reaching, Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth period, when Helenius knocked Teper on the left.
The score was so loud that the convoy in front of the home audience did not even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was assured, Helenius was very temperate.
In a circle interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helen was happy right after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helen’s career.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup, Helenius said in a statement to the evening newspaper before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's been on my mind.
This is not going to get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice president is calling for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult Circumstances
Rescuers are looking for trapped as well as dead in the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please visit the port city and its neighboring town of Dongga.
So far, all the victims are from Palusta, the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the ruined buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearing.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as in the disaster zone electricity and telecommunications connections are in many places broken.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Suomi finalist’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäs Ruukki is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview, a question was asked to each of the finalists.
The finalists raised the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, gave a hesitant response to sweet but benevolent laughs in the audience.
Anttikoski’s question had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was, which the mystery finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said with a thought.
The pause for reflection was in the audience during the laugh, until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received the audience’s cheering applause with laughter.
Earlier on the mission tour Anttikoski drew attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21.00 when Miss Finland Michaela S<0xC3><0xB6>derholm resigns last year.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "cool": generally attractive coolness and, in part, the opposite dissident coolness.
According to the researchers’ description, charmingly cool people had many socially desirable traits: they were outward-looking, friendly, friendly, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and a grudge.
They were thirsty for experience and were little interested in outside reviews.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis is not cool: a high status in adolescence may not lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, had parties, sought out good-looking groups and sought favor with others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they were less successful than their more inconspicuous peers.
Lock susautos, branded bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more ready to make friends with their regular market shirt than with those wearing a branded shirt — despite the fact that most chose to wear a branded shirt in the case of an acquaintance.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, be careful!
There's a storm coming in, the weather warning is screaming red.
During the weekend, the amount of water in southern Greece can rain as much as in Finland on average in six months.
The storm of Zorbas strikes Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the High Representative, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather alert to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service in Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the storm's toughest hips are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, the storm Kuisma blew at its worst at a rate of about 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the storm Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimeters of water can come to southern Greece this weekend.
It accounts for about half of the annual rainfall in Finland.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The storm of Zorbas has caused flooding to Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's drooling Love Island Finland -Ankun?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Rarely do you know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku, which has been drooled by several men, also appears as a crafting aunt in the strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
With videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make a mustache from an old paper roll.
Anku also shows her sympathetic style of how the stockings can be sewn on a hedgehog with the right spikes.
Now we make the Easter grass grow, but we do it in a little surprising way, Anku hints and presents sawdust, stockings and grass seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku’s Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shakes and chews adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more tens of minutes after his Russian gp pole position when he was in front of the media.
The great tour left behind the Mercedes No. 1 star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important criticism of the Finnish rider who gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he skipped the round.
It feels good, I still shake a little bit, Bottas explained.
I've only been on the pile once this year, in Austria (in the middle of the year), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip the Sochi track, so the departure is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he was going to win tomorrow, or whether it was going to be the case with Hamilton, who was heading for the World Cup.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the pile, there can be no other goal, Mr. Bottas.
But as a team, we're fighting both championships.
Lewis's leadership Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas’ success, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff also tasted it.
Lewis was going to win Valtteri, but he didn't make it to the stand.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything apart to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
When asked whether Bottas and Hamilton were allowed to drive fairly, Wolff replied with a grudge.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen wins the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rallying ended rarely.
Never before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg, the Tuusulas, who won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 categories in the final rally in the Turku and Salon environment.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee made sure of the best achievement of his career, when the third place in the final race sealed him with the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, who competed at Honda Civic, and Ville Mäkelä, the manor reader, started the Turku competition at the malt, because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give a leveling, while some of the additional lights were tricked by another special experiment.
It was quite blind to the third part.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to relax.
On Saturday, Jussi Tepo, who was the second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syria’s foreign minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN address, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the war that has lasted seven years.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is scheduled for October.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court drama on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, a professor who accused him of harassment, received an extraordinary number of people on the screen.
In the United States, a full-fledged Supreme Court judge’s nomination drama caught at least 20 million people on their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people, and CNN reported that it had achieved a record of 8.2 million live streams per year.
CNN’s figure rises to more than 10 million when it comes to YouTube and Facebook followers.
Fox News Digital also launched 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are channel-specific, TV viewers’ figures come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but in any case, they are huge.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually only eligible for sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The annual most watched show in the U.S., the final match of the U.S. Football League’s NFL Super Bowl, is certainly on its way.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump’s first speech to Congress saw a total of 48 million people and more than 30 million people taking office.
A very important matter
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge in the United States is an extremely important case, as the posts are life-long.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was a so-called horizontal language, the voice of which could resolve the position of a nine-member court.
He was a proponent of abortion and sexual minority rights, and in 2015, for example, he decided with his vote that same-sex couples were granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the right to a conservative overpowering power for decades.
Children have the right to know their parents.
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children’s health information on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of small children.
A temporary correction was obtained in autumn 2016 for children under the age of 10.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing long time to fix it.
Now the repair is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than an outcry.
After that, the understanding of the layman is about pressing the button: when now the pipe is held, it is opened.
Of course, the child can show his/her parents his/her information if he/she has bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do you have?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and the 10-year-old does not even receive bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of the fourth grader except by asking them to be printed.
This is not so much about the rights of parents as the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations in which not all things can be freely spoken about.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the U.S., the FBI began to perpetrate harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media reports, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more limited investigation, and it may not be public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The aggressor continued to pulsate even in the chamber.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "shut up."
The police were threatened by a suspected attacker in Kajaani on Saturday night.
The official informs of the incident that began when a 30-year-old man challenged the dispute in a central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client within the nutrition business.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When a third party intervened, he hit him too.
Trinitized assault led to a police call.
The patrol arrested the man and took him to the Kajaani police station, police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they've sent a man to a police prison to "resolve".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition by an official.
Subsidies prepare to start work at Sulawesi in Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Finnish UNICEF Chief Information Officer Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF is always fully equipped for emergency assistance, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In Sulawesi, rescue operations are under way, but the situation in the Donggala area is a little further north.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance measures are difficult because the roads are also broken,” says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often light-structured, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is huge.
When the survivors are found, they need shelter - at first, for example tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are usually able to provide water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in store.
Water systems will be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water will be transported first by lorries, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and connecting families is part of UNICEF’s mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started to raise funds to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk to end Tesla’s government fines of $20 million for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by signing a contract with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement with the US securities market regulator.
By agreeing to Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull the electric car company Tesla out of the stock market, which led to a rapid rise in the company’s share price.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be president of Tesla's government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new “independent member” of its board of directors and take two “independent leaders” into its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue to be Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fines, Tesla has to pay a $20 million fine to the financial controller.
The tweets mislead investors.
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets misled investors and Tesla’s shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a share price of $420.
Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent a day after the tweets, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14% when the SEC reported fraud charges.
The news is expected to re-confirm the company’s course.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the wise men do not move.
This is a technical failure.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: while the crypt of the church would be a form of exorcism and the organ would make itself sound.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have been broken and a new part is expected,” says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account states that the last sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says church bells don't ring because of a fault.
