The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, 29 percent in total
The visible weakening of the two parties of the Grand Coalition so far and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, were brought about by the advance parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position was severely shaken, suffered a particularly severe loss.
In contrast, the president of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country will remain the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, but lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP was even worse, losing nearly 9 percent of the vote by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved by both major parties in Austria’s post-war history and, in particular, the result is literally disastrous for the People’s Party that brought forward the elections.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a significant advantage before SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to opinion polls.
The electorate, however, apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation has been expressed about the possible resignation of the party president Wilhelm Molterer and the current Vice-Chancellor.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate an increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties, which, at the time of the European Union's accession to the European Union (FP<0xC3><0x96>), had already taken 18 per cent of the votes and 11 per cent of the votes from the BZ<0xC3><0x96> (Austrian Freedom Party), the social democrats expressed their fears about the repeat of the year 1999 when the People's Party came under joint government.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party, however, lost some of its popularity and dropped from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations may get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reporting for illegal collection of beetles could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be some chilling in Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister announced this in New York after meeting with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner, today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be a certain degree of obsolescence," he said after the meeting, which took place under Czech inspiration.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it would be difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who had been acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for release against bail and wait for the verdict freely, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, and it would be possible to acquit him," the chief of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convicted person with "competent legal aid", the Indian minister said.
However, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such help.
“Our main interest with India is to preserve the best relationships with many years of tradition.
The Indians also recognize this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
Asked whether the Indian side had received a promise to deal with the matter, the minister was out of the question.
“I’ve already received a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech judges in battle for seabed
Enter the walled electronic map showing Australia and neighboring marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division’s thirty-member team of ocean and sea law experts.
His boss, Václav Mikulka, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes complemented by an explanation.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, and so far it is scarcely known.
Here you can find oil, ore and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms, which could be the key to the development of a cancer medicine, for example.
Seabeds larger than dry land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new subsea areas.
Under the United Nations Convention, they assert their rights, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly about the area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often extends from the shores of a given country up to a few hundred kilometers away.
Such a country shall have the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, we keep the part and the bottom layer of the continental pedestal that is the natural continuation of the subterranean continent.
At the borders of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, it extends beyond the limits of the economic zone alone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission setting the external borders of the Continental Shelf shall be supplemented by an extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is legal and professional-technical assistance to the committee.
The committee has so far discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia in the world has recently sparked a resounding echo, which has been the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed awarded to it by the Commission has an area of about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from future use of the seabed are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
This can be done within ten years of the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"However, the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggeratingly, "some areas are legally clearly demarcated and their regime is enshrined in a treaty."
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the sea floor is now in the Czech Republic.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organization, like investors in some other countries, received the so-called pioneer investor status under the Convention in 1991.
It is authorised to produce in the Clarion Clipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is divided there, it's a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
"This can be extracted in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian member of the division, presents an example of a concretion.
It reminds me of a potato or, with a little imagination, a parchment with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present during the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became comfy, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming increasingly apparent.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, special German forces indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the GSG 9, the staff of the German Federal Police Aeroplane and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were also at the site of the liberation.
According to ministry officials, on Monday evening, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage-takers allowed their prisoners to run, and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage-taking.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
“Unfortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped five German, five Italian, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to and from the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remains unclear, as well as details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there is no information yet on when they will return to Germany.
According to the “Bild” newspaper, the five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force’s Airbus flight.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has failed with a small majority the $700 billion bailout package proposed for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the depths.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the program aimed at curbing the chaos in the financial markets did not receive a majority.
Supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiators of the Democratic Party, called for the support of MPs, even if the plan is still unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after the failure had been made public.
Experts report further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers are registering more and more reservations.
It is a good winter for German tour operators.
According to a study, the traffic of road reservations for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ desire for travel did not fade, according to the study.
When booking for the winter season, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year’s period, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was roughly 11 percent higher than in October 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States is particularly sought after, the DRV said.
The rate of reservations here has increased by about a third.
The most popular destinations for the Germans are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
“The roads are mostly organized,” said Dr. Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, for organised trips, the costs can be "calculated better for passengers than for individually organised trips."
Passengers can save money, among other things, with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to record traffic growth again compared to the previous year - although another study shows that fewer German tourists took a trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Without a break, repeated ballermann hits, liter jar of beers and design dirndlit-wearing celebrities.
The Wiesen debut.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
He's a blonde, a television presenter, and he's wearing a tailored dirndlit.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my clothes in the turf.
But there is one thing that connects us: We've only been on Wiesnen for three minutes, and the photographers are already rushing us and filling their memory cards - it's very flattering, and all this is on my first visit to Wiesnen.
This is how we can make friends.
It seems that cheap dirndli will fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited.
But when you arrive at Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or leather pants; no one looks at you with a grudge or awkwardness - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I wrongly tied the apron: "You're free tied to your left, you're a virgin in the middle, you're sold to your right, you're a widow in the back."
I secretly transferred the masni from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others throw less fuss around fine flirting techniques and wear a simple blanket with the inscription "I'm too drunk to dress up" and unsolicitedly show off their naked asses.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, extending the "aaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all of this after he gets rid of the contents of his previously-drinked jar.
Right next to one of the fireblowers, which everyone sees as trash.
Bob is one of the infamous "drinkers."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances will march around the scene and take care of the poor vapors.
Nurses always show up in a team - four of them carry a covered gurney from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuffed.
You can't see who's lying in the liquor coffin under the tarpaulin.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," cried one of the sanitizers to me, asking my question, and then in the whirlwind.
Police named the victim of the accident
Police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, had an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released for bail.
Expanding diplomatic horizon of Turkey
Long before Turkey’s intention to join the European Union, European powers were burning with the desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least this is what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with a tower at each of the front corners, and looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little drudgery.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise this was the most western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “late future” of the conquests, sought to realize its ambitions for the conquest of the Middle East with the help of this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to today’s Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabian partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, an ammo train exploded and destroyed the building’s beautifully constructed roof.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has far exceeded it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, it serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party in the government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, with Iraq, Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of dusk, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban quarter, between semi-finished shopping malls and coffee shops. In the latter, mid-leaders in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-centred politician in any other European country.
She was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure she even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy aims to help Turkey re-integrate into its immediate environment.
“The Cold War upset the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to make a choice?"
“Turkey never wanted to get a response.”
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said, almost mechanically, that Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, benefit Europe and the United States in the same way as Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, figuratively speaking, with Turkey, all of Europe can travel to Asia and the Middle East along those east-facing railways.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly spent awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the recovery of this ornamented building 100 years ago.
That they would have been surprised to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as soon as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back to the Bosphorus, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least there was no question about which continent to claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Nerologue, Sept. 11) has been the musical director of Guildford, leading the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the part of the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in harmony with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any of the music they put before it - be it the madrigal or a piece of Messiaen; without an escort or a large orchestral escort.
The musical versatility of such a young choir is often amazing and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration for our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Todd tell us, "Let the music speak by itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it.”
His master's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the music level was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there was ever a conductor who was supposed to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty or so years, I have been criticizing more than 100 concerts, but I have never been disappointed by one, and I have often been fascinated by them.
In Tod Handley, there was greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated those conductors who, in his words, simply "had been galloping around the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
Many of us will miss you.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25) necrologue, "He continued his studies in economics in Oxford in 1946 and became a Fellow of the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while constantly preparing for his bachelor's degree, master's degree, and PhD's title."
This is from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End" author's notes, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economics at the University of Nottingham and, under the leadership of Professor J.D. Chambers, completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he was in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 he attended the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff had this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Philosopher's Choir
I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black-and-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as respect for the people in the photos, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is influenced by emotions.
"Resino has the ability to capture magical moments."
Second-time sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
It is true that the passenger compartment was already large enough for its predecessor, but the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, it has undergone a number of internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new body, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we turn to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, jazz is less well-known, but it is making sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, is Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and later in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces have been sold from Jazz since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million sales in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz in 2007, by 2009, it is estimated that it will sell 100,000 cars, resulting in an increase of 17% on the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 pieces of Jazz on the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary will calculate 2,000 examples sold in a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease the decline in Honda’s traffic in Spain.
The company’s representatives are forecasting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes it can achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, the US would account for 50% of Insight’s market share, while the remaining share would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the official Valencia show scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider), and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has also become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body, on the one hand, and the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total load space of the trunk - called double floor - has increased, currently 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters exceed the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the above-mentioned dimensions for the 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear led lights or optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the front Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model can be ordered with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than that of the previous model, with lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while at the same time the engine delivers outstanding performance in every respect.
The 1.2 litre power output is 90 hp at 6000 rpm and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which was 78 hp in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-horse-power 1.4-litre Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and has an emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoidance "bee car"
In order to develop accident prevention technologies, Nissan is inspired by nature and the world of bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot to avoid accidents by mimicking bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technology Center, in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, said the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-tier safety cover.
The robot enhances the ability to avoid collisions with the company’s products.
While flying, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
However, the role of the complex eye of the uterus is much more important, with which it can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees. Consequently, it can fly undisturbed in the personal space of the uterus.
To replicate the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a laser rangefinder.
The instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an action to avoid collision.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot, mimicking the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The system is best distinguished by the fact that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre is completely automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the manoeuvring manoeuvre should not be directed upwards or downwards, or diagonally, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, that is, not in infinite directions and ways, as in the case of bees.
Therefore, apart from acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but it really isn’t gigabytes, but we don’t even talk about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of technology for immediate collision prevention, which, according to Nissan’s estimates, could enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system in order to get the car to its final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the Treasury Department of the United States, apart from having a lot of cash to invest, has no common sense.
Because of the crisis and the fact that Americans don’t get stuck in the mazes of questionable-paid mortgage banks, a fun and informative online game called “Bad Credit Hotel” has been created.
It's the hotel of bad loans... that's for the galleys.
The design of the accommodation and especially the receptionist’s b<0xC3><0xBA>skomor suggests that we should think again, twice, or rather three times, if the time for borrowing really has just arrived.
And especially where to apply for a loan, as this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on this website is really useful, but little detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we completed the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it's something, because we don't dare to dream about buying a home...
Morgan Stanley opens up capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a share in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after the Morgan Stanley stock price has fallen high on the stock exchange.
A week after the prior agreement was made public, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion in total.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which give it a 10% return and a conversion rate of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley says the global transaction is based on an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price fell by 6.79% at around 5 p.m. in Greenwich, ending in $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a banking company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group of Companies.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its operations, but it is under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
According to the terms announced on Monday, the deal has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely made up of ordinary shares,” explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
“However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and prevent potential risks.”
In terms of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share is reduced by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares in one year’s time, if the latter’s trading rate exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can leverage its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid assets.
However, the group spokeswoman did not want to provide accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet had improved “resolutely” since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great test for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of securing against the risk of non-payment has fallen to the sky.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the big investment banks remained "survivor" after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had received $15 billion, some of which came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Monday's statement by Rafael Correa, Quito
The re-establishment of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is a common plan for Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution.
He successfully completed his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum, according to official results, which accounted for 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted against, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast as uncompleted.
For the adoption of the draft Constitution, 50% + 1 vote was required.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a countdown by a non-governmental organisation both proved the huge advantage of "yes" votes with a 63% and 70% ratio.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won a sweeping victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians at the governor's seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa congratulated Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a relaxed atmosphere, with a main theme of 444 points, summarising the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts the state power at the service of the economy, maintaining to the state the right to “design development” for a country that is basically living on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign currency sent by immigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she wants to take advantage of this opportunity and will again compete for the presidency in February 2009.
The president has already begun to implement this in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the minimum standard of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to Quito and Washington's agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as the basis for American anti-drug measures.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad.
An Egyptian commando struck him on the kidnappers who had taken eleven tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad this morning.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base at around 6:30 p.m., which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and the kidnappers “have not been paid a ransom,” said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat on 19 September in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in an off-road safari. The group was then dragged from one hiding place for 35 unknown hostages to another.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the safari operator Aegyptous.
An Egyptian security chief said a 30-member special commando arrived at the scene on two helicopters, where they were ambushed on the hostages just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," the leader said, asking for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 troops were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and action teams," he said, without further details being provided.
He also denied that the hostages had been paid a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that an off-road vehicle was intercepted while patrolling, on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them (including the Chadian leader) were killed and two were arrested.
According to the military, the hostages were in contact with a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The Silent Majority of Culture
At the heart of the news and the current election campaign is the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only be happy about that.
But a slice of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will raise his word to show what ridiculous amounts are being managed by small museums, archives, archeological excavations and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that form part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros to restore Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy are working on the research of history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archeological finds, with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations protect our tooth and nail heritage and protest with the last strength of the drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up to protect historical and cultural heritage?
Fortis Bank to be nationalised by Benelux governments
The Benelux countries are helping with partial nationalisation because of the spillover effect of the US credit crisis – the first European – at the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortison: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition authority.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the wake of an international financial market crisis that has been ringing in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in the case of the bank can therefore be regarded as precedent-setting in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states acquire nearly half (49%) of the bank’s existing assets.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the activities acquired by ABN Amro last year, mainly insurance companies.
Fortis' shares started to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week, there were serious crisis events at the institute.
Analysts agree, however, that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let go of bankruptcy.
The company's papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the Group’s total market capitalisation is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company directors, this is not realistic.
In addition, the management blamed overseas market uncertainties regarding the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the downfall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to lead the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a substantial offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients so far, and the accounts have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurers, based on people’s drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data in all cases to the consent of the person concerned.
This has to be in an independent hands, otherwise we'll leave the chicken to the fox," said Richard Dicket, the developer of the drug prescription program.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health of the applicant customer, and if the risk is considered too high, they do not make any insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick has worked out a much cheaper procedure for ten years: from pharmacies, the customer ID number makes it easy to obtain which drugs he has purchased in the last year and a half, and from this the program itself deduces what kind of disease he is suffering from and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat level is practically unmanageable, which immediately ranks you in a higher risk category.
Several versions of the scheme are in circulation, some of them also set a risk multiplier number, so the insurer has little to do outside of the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can also be used against migraines or heat waves, but they can also be effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former are not.
Separate companies were formed to retrieve and process the data, and before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies, they ask for the patient’s consent.
The authorities are now obliged to do so, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
More recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them with drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it will be more and more difficult to monitor usage.
There is a separate Health Data Protection Act, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurers.
Before Congress, there is a bill that also gives the authorities control over companies specialising in data reporting.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his program, which would bind the data to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another issue is that the data subject can hardly deny the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox's benevolence.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit has also dominated this issue, along with other, largely global, problems.
Today there will also be a summit in France and India, where nuclear cooperation will be the main focus.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater voice in international affairs, the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even raised at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the European Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. increase trade to a hundred billion euros.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally combined, meaning that air traffic may also expand in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy said they'd speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India’s number one trading partner, New Delhi is only number nine among the EU’s partners.
The summit focused its attention on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, were condemned on both sides in all its forms and called for a UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which means that it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed that a global deal should be reached at the climate conference next year and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent rising food prices and support an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister goes to the French capital, where he plans to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, French companies are expected to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to news agency reports, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries on 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, since Italy will occupy a 264-square-meter exhibition area by setting up a unified Italy Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion "Room Struktur", which will also give an opportunity to present the data, trends and prospects of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the Italian publishing market continues to decline the proportion of foreign authors, especially in adult and youth publications.
Steve Fossett's plane was found missing a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, which disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was discovered on a 3,000-meter high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, dispelled all remaining doubts: “After determining the plane’s position, we sent a team out, and now we can be sure it’s the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared,” he said in a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Agency (NTSB) said it had been asked a committee of inquiry a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which was able to identify the plane and establish that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett took a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found Fossett's personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes home.
Two Fosset IDs issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was filed a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks that have allowed him to enter history.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he was able to fly around the earth for the first time with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the country without landing.
His many records include flying over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and definite style hobby scooter with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest compact SUV from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German carmaker tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
Because of this, the introduction campaign of the SUV GLK, which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign, which accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle, uses a hitherto unknown media communication tool, including Utopian 3D posters that have not been used by the car brand in Italy.
The giant poster action, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, by November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the introduction of the car’s space effect, in which the new SUV will be shown in almost real size and in three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como.
The viewer will feel like the car stands out from the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one to form a unified image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this help to attract the interest of future customers? We'll see.
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Triveneto youths, they're probably being excluded from the tracks.
But who are the 150-200 boys and girls who are now making the whole of Italy ashamed? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padova, Trieste, and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by smaller, scattered groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were flagged on which the native city of the fans was marked: they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi fan team, Levski's drivers.
The Italian Football Association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans, which were named tickets, making it easier to check the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of the Interior also controlled everyone: there was no one among those who were preparing for Sofia who was being prosecuted, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who have a record of football, were denied tickets and exits.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior is awaiting reports from the Sofia police and then takes the necessary measures: fans arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to all the stadiums in Italy, but also to all the stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet on any football field.
Lucky for you.
But we also have to fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that there will be others joining this group of barely one hundred and fifty.
“We must stop this fire and not excuse anyone who behaves like that,” the Ministry of the Interior said.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's national match day is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia there is a small cell supporting the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Committee for the Safety of Sport Events, which can count on a section of the Homeland Security Service, the intelligence services dealing with fan behaviour.
"The scandal of Duce-Duce and the swinging arm under the Italian anthem? No crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was developed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as head of the Ministry of the Interior's observatory (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli previously served as Chief of Police of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true is not forbidden in Bulgaria to feed Duce, but the behavior of the 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, he added, the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the offence was committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem, and we need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s also talk a little bit about the Italian anthem: it’s not a crime, but if I may say so, it’s not a good-natured thing.”
