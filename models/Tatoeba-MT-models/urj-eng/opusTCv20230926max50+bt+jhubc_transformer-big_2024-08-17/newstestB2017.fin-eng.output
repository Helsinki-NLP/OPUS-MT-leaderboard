28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his case in order."
The body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Medical Department.
According to San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
His brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became the chef of San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family. We're very sorry," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally settled down.
“He found the apartment and he had a girlfriend,” Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to make food for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shined every day,” he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the incident will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-4444.
Retiring junior doctors call for new work-fighting measures
Representatives of UK junior doctors (who are mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new labour-fighting measures in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Juvenile Medicine Committee (JDC), a member of the British Medical Association (BMA), is calling on its entire government to support further efforts in the field of combat work from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter on Twitter to members of the JDC, saying the government had “permanently failed” on issues that McCourt said led to the treaty being rejected.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC Government has voted against a completely new draft treaty and calls for a new formal negotiation of all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government asking for permission to gradually expand its efforts to combat labour from the beginning of September."
Because of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, head of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members at pre-voting meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand for a settlement and formally end the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin was accepted by his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had a clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation in Ankara.
The two sides shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin and he didn’t get much heat, even with his own restraining standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his "good friend" Mr Putin, according to a report five times.
I didn’t keep the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I saw his enthusiasm the other way around.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction to the time of the event was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara with harsh words and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media campaigned against Ankara in a thorough and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-dominated areas in Syria.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has strongly denied the allegations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only held so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a truce to the harsh are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic impact on the settlement.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as there are normally millions of Russian tourists travelling to Turkey’s coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be appalled by the relief, as air traffic will eventually be able to continue.
They put their faith in a late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed once again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the newspaper Vedemost wrote in an article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it thinks the West is reacting instinctively to the attempted coup d'état.
Without forgetting the old grudge about Turkey's accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool spaces and to break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for elected authorities after a coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own concerns about the exchange of power.
Thus, at their summit meeting in the prame seaside palace, Russia and Turkey were able to convey a picture described by an analyst as a “foreign alliance”: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West are joining forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not addressed the issue at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of disagreements between the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by a NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again even speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside of Scotland
According to RBS, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that in the future it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to back off its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to allow more national brands to enter the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used as an abbreviation for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of the head office and the stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland, "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because of what our staff is working for, because we are now turning into a bank of many different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their community, and our employees work with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring sports.
“Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for our customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
“It would have been very exciting three years ago if we had said that we were going to be an excellent bank for our customers and adopted brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rode Prediction to win at Newmarket and won 3,000.
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant him a 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the UK championship at Newmarket on Friday.
On this milestone he achieved victory by riding his horse Predilection twice on the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races running on a flat track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson have previously joined him.
The three-time championjockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the surface, because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-strong audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility.”
Dettori accepts cheers with Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the escalator race, and they are the champion jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it’s no surprise that he just reached this milestone, which few have ever reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of racing racing, his enthusiasm and pruning have brought supporters to the sport for years.”
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races if he hadn’t competed only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie’s riding career at the UK Games has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vibrant person, which is good for the British racing race, but above all, he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori fancied his achievement in a distinctive way by flying down his horse’s back.
"From flying to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been an example of the British racing race for two decades.
There have been ups and downs.
He has won numerous major competitions, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 for "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started, but he showed admirable character strength, showed his doubts and returned to his best.
And he’s not about to end his career yet – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until he’s at least 50 years old.”
Putin resigns Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of government, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin’s trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a statement from the Kremlin, President Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration”, but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who has served as Vice-President of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the president’s protocol department and the government’s office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented."
Putin told Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close associate of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of government, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Are the firings a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who is praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
I have now served as the President’s Chief Executive for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as head of the KGB's substituted Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed deputy chief of staff.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russian President after Putin’s second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from choosing for the third term.
However, the mission went to Dmitry Medvedev, another member of Putin’s immediate circle.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson gets fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, said they were fired in a joint press release.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative disagreements.
“I’m sorry this happened,” he said in a statement.
Information on how Gibson’s character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, reports ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first production in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
"I hoped to see the series until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important ones: the best fans the series could have ever hoped for.”
Season 12 begins in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious beach of fish in the Banff garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are gusts of wind that have fallen to the ground under the gust of a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seashore, published a vision of footage in Periscope, hoping to get a response to the appearance of these five-headed fish.
Queensferry transit bridge is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the land bridge of the Queensferry crossing bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "coverbones" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vignettes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit bridge.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and more than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of a bridge section between the bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised to its place.”
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors Project, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urinary column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the road cover was installed and attached to the North Tower column road cover, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., the continental) gap.
This was done by pulling a 700 mm north of the land bridge to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time demanding a high level of accuracy.
Massive due to its length of 222 metres and its weight of about 6,000 tonnes, it had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
And with great precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small – just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay Rescue Service Reveals Three Men's Miracle Rescue
The three men who had been stranded on water by their fishing boat outside Anglesey were saved as if by miracle.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue station alerted local time on Friday at 1:20 p.m. when its crew discovered an accident in the bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
“We saw the boat circling right next to them, and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, the lifeboat driver of Moelfren.
“By the time we got into the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them.”
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, aged 60, was found to be exhausted with a buoy and no life jacket.
They were all taken aboard a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a wonder these three men on water are still alive and in perfect shape.
There was an emergency fire alarm in the engine of the boat, but for some reason it had been disconnected from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their journey.”
Pokémon Go Yacht Brings Health and Happiness
It’s fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Initially, screen time was only taken by watching TV, then video games and, lastly, smartphones came.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor exercise don’t exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game app that features characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later made into a series of cartoons, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many of the popular cultural phenomena, this also broke a bit before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones to find Pokémon that are tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be “photographed” (with the phone’s display) or “captured”.
The flicker has enchanted the generation that played the video game younger and lifted the backs off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch smartwatch’s Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people moving for 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who the users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns encouraging people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
People who move regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health-supporting things – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disdainful ridiculers.
And yes, someone can walk through the door while playing.
What about it?
Breakthrough is done.
For even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track your activity earlier, they did not allow you to get started, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and the use will decrease in time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality will be combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people going hunting and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabs gold in women's multi-player gymnast
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Easy with booms.
The jaws shivering with a permannal.
Great in everything.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, an American 19-year-old racket champion won the multi-match championship and raised the distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the silver-placed teammate "Final Five" on Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles will perform at the Women's Stand Gymnastics Multi-Competition Final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive, and the fifth, American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his total points of the final appeared and his long journey to this moment ended.
Achievement takes the sport to a whole new dimension and puts it in the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 World Cup medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest standing champion of all time."
In Brazil, there was still one final race, which took place above all between Biles and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States will hug after winning gold and silver in the women's multi-match final on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and is now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program—which includes a volt series known as his trump card—is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard in the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When Boorman was a child, his grandparents adopted him and found the mother of coach Aimee Boorman. Boorman found the girl when she was on a daycare tour in the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost a single multi-match since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead with two threads, it was like fabrication.
There was a boom and a permanto, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He returned to the lead position after scoring 15,433 points and crowned the final result with 15,933 points from the perm.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final points—which was mere formality—and tears began to appear around the glittering border color of Biles, red, white, and blue, when his dream of writing his clip book came true.
Raisman’s performance was a minor reluctance to a four-year-old race, when he first split the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team "grandmother", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus emerged from the loss position as a winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As far as Bilesin is concerned, this 19-year-old tweet, made earlier this week and widely spread, now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three people are victims of serial killers listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix’s most devastating massacre in ten years, while the victims sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, police said in a statement.
According to the authorities, on June 12, a car parked on the side of the street was shot at by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple death was not caused by the robbery, as the attacker did not take any handbags or $2,900 found in another adult victim's hall.
Phoenix police spokeswoman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the death was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred in predominantly Latin American-populated areas within four months.
"The events have in common that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists don’t want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that the three of them had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a press release announcing the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple death, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found shells and picked up fragments of a bullet from the car seat and a bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital smallheadedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which he was unaware of when she was pregnant.
“When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t get through this.
I can't make it.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing a child in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore,” says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a roller coaster.
Edmund got up and started to sit down until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents a sign invented by Edmund, which means "sing for me."
“We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean the usual sign language, but also the sign language invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
There is great variation in symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
“I kept saying, ‘What’s going on with us,
What will happen to us.”
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things tend to be organized.
You love your child and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods have caused large-scale rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in south-east Louisiana and South Mississippi flood over their bays and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor’s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service’s announcement, water may enter the area by an additional 76-127 mm.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning was issued on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, is predicted to rise to a record high.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the lower part of Ascension County pose a threat, as flooding rivers are slowly draining into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi border, had risen at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue work continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were earlier on Friday near Gloster among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other boy in the neighborhood had warned him.
“We got up, and the water came with constant feed,” Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
She had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he is the only one who can swim.
Rescuers had saved all three large military-style trucks and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has become heavily wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to heavy rains and the flooding of the streets, the residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
Regional director Robby Miller said the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped in a flood.
Evacuated shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to retreat,” he says.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
“Last time we experienced a great flood in March,” says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood seems to be the same."
In Mississippi, the rains continued to be steady along the Gulf Coast, says Rupert Lacy, rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy reports that a handful of houses under the flood were reported on Thursday, but so far no information had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and it's raining all the time."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has received multiple bullets into his body, survives the Philadelphia shooting scene
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and several surgeries have been performed on him.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He started his first class at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men might have been a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shells that originated from various assault weapons.
“It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the pavement.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old who was shot in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a misguided bullet while playing outside her home on Tuesday in West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
With this name, I call the Olympic team of the women's gymnasts, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful scaffolding programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
Such views are at the top of the species, but the same does not appear in scaffolding classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five (“Final Five”), as the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly’s final year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private scaffolding clubs maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, travel, performance fees, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
Most of the scaffolding clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support their activities.
The training of the gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and that means an expensive and long-term commitment to the gymnasts’ families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached the sports enthusiasts since they started the gymnast.
We need to organise a more affordable and accessible education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnast foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have provided a free or affordable opportunity for more than 15,000 young people (mostly black and Latin American) to enter the gymnasts, some of whom have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality scaffolding for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Workforce training develops strength, suppleness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked the excitement of thousands of young girls who now want to start the gymnast, and that’s just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girlpower" you demonstrated when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior Doctors Reject Jeremy Hunt's Proposal and Prepare for New Strikes
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors who voted rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force a deal and said the British public health system (NHS) was “no-one’s country” and that any additional delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move on to a new agreement that includes changes to the practices of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in times of unsociality.
Last night, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement in which she said: "Junior doctors are still very cautious about the proposed agreement, with a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has acted reluctantly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new work-fighting measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors in the strike department.
Ministers hoped that the dispute over the changes would be brought to an end by concluding a renewed agreement with the British doctors' trade union officials.
Trade Union BMA wants a better weekend pay for 54,000 junior doctors covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Executive Director of NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to start new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the extremes and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical personnel and their families.
We have been negotiating with the Committee on Juvenile Medicine for the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the revelation of maladministration.
The workers were hopeful that continued positive engagement with other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from work breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how seriously the workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that costs about €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are receiving about €2.40 a day, when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of use.
Anticoagulation ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the British public health system (NHS) and is evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, one quarter of whom have a heart attack that either recurs or have a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fatty substance that builds up in the walls of the blood vessels and gives birth to plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can give birth to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is released, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by the British manufacturer AstraZeneca, which is sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
Today's draft NICE guideline recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 milligrams and aspirin given twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at NICE, says: “Although effective treatments are available to effectively prevent the progression of the disease and the development of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to limited data on efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, a longer period of treatment is not recommended in the draft guideline.
Due to a climate of political correctness, voting in Muslim regions flourished
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was fired last year for his role in corruption, as a result of which the government made a report
A climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report published today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticized police, election observers, and city councils for closing their eyes to election fraud “because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and current anti-corruption figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only has to give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers should be dipped after voting in an indelible tone so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for better access for journalists to the Government documents and to the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against the financial interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments,” he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report to East London after the vote on the Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special election court ordered the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, to resign from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahma “destroyed” the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to “use his campaign as a basis for the religious duty of every believing Muslim to vote for him.”
Up to 300 of the votes were questioned or fraudulently cast in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said the evidence of the fraud came from all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about the postal fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were told that they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the older members, particularly in communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to this kind of activity because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the processing of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent "sound harvesting".
The present report by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks on the registration process in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Baptism of fingers in an indelible tone after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting the handling of completed mailed votes and mailed envelopes from political activists.
The police have the right to establish security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the Constitution of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Refusal of photography at polling stations.
Only allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthening training to ensure that staff supervises the rule that only one person at a time is allowed to enter the voting booth.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and considers it "surprising" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from their duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"He was found guilty without any serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient "cross-checks" of the city council's electoral lists.
“The court’s decision in the Tower Hamlet case last year was a wake-up call,” says Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by a worrying and hidden electoral fraud by some and its denial.”
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance to the Duchess Catherine and other doubles are raving at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the dual nature of Duchess Catherine on the cycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be an actor’s favorite Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin brother.
Brady Ellison, a US men's spring shooting team, caused a storm on Twitter after a photo of her in which she resembled the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted to hearing from a child that he resembled DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the resemblance as big, except perhaps for beards and mustaches,” Brady Huffington told the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
The 2012 London Games saw the appearance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will undoubtedly be highlighted even more in these games.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been described as a double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the beaches, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athlete version" of the actor in the Inception movie.
Similarly, for a long time, the resemblance between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been cited, which is emphasized by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and blond hair, while American team Nathan Adrian is a "athetic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt" according to fans.
These two iron women, Hope Solo (left) and Jennifer Carpenter (right) of the Dexter series, resemble each other in their faces and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for a couple’s resemblance.
One tweeter recently expressed his satisfaction when “the rest of the internet agrees with Hope Solo’s and Jennifer Carpenter’s resemblance.”
The American football star and Dexter series actor are truly strikingly similar to each other in their faces and eyes.
Many have also seen a resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna returns! for Gabrielle Union.
CBC’s Olympic commentator apologizes after saying a Chinese swimmer “dead like a pig”
Byron’s MacDonalds analysis, instead of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth in a women’s 4 x 200-meter freestyle message, shocked CBC’s direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “lost in smell” and “dead like a pig” during the race.
The narrator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 m freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second part of the message at 1:57.79, remaining 1.61 seconds from the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to swim to catch up with China.
Viewers around Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC narrator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig??????
The idiot didn’t realize he was still on the show.”
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who slept in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final, was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious critical comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not keep their words when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald’s remarks: “We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its apologies to over 90 other tweeters who complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they made their way into the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized for the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying he didn’t mean it to be personal.
“I want to apologize for my comment that I made last night after the women’s relay,” MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
“I’m referring to a swimmer’s performance, not a person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything demeaning with my words, and I’m very sorry.”
In Primark, a woman in the middle of a trade uncontrollably shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when the woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit the underpants.
He further worsened the situation by evaluating what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to spin and eventually experimented with four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the same time at the store, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People didn’t believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own jerseys and panties and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it with complete shame.
Everyone stared as he took off the panties he tried and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn’t like them, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks – nor did he think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had put on.”
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident in Kent Town, continues: “How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the store staff was trying to remove these items from the sale after the woman left – what’s right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has brought them in without having washed them after that,” adds Davidson.
Primark’s spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
How to defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Association in New York and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or assaulter waving a gun at a nearby distance.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant on the knee to the groin, and when he doubles the pain, slap him on the face with a gun on the barrel and back down by holding the gun pointing at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist on the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointing at the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash – unless you’re the Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright, a travel guide, licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and his cock reflexes to a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most repulsive places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknotes, handcuffs at Piccadilly Circus, flushing the train toilet and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the targets with a lumenometer to see for himself and to show viewers where the tongue was pushing.
The experiment was made into a documentary film called Ian Wright – Following the Inner Force, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the rinsing button on the train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening good bacteria in the gut and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the railway station handrails and the toilet flush button undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I have been quite carefree about my health since I was a child and have put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and misery.”
In the film, he showed that he was worthy of his reputation.
The border only met in a sloppy public toilet in Russia.
The Luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, it should be said that in newly washed hands the amount is usually less than 60.
The line came up in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the snow meter measured 4,000 units – in newly washed hands the same figure is less than 60.
In the documentary film Ian Wright, which was produced with Valio, Wright explores the importance of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: “This is almost the worst smell I’ve smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don’t lick anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – Following Internal Power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the Valio snack, juice and novelty category, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and in the end we ended up asking for Ia.”
The health of the intestines has become a global trend.
“We wanted to bring them into a wider context instead of just talking about products and telling about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestines has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!”
Tom Hakala, director of the film, adds: “Let’s say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some objects was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some dirty arrows on the tape."
In a poll conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 percent said they used products that added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
The family destroyed a city-owned rental building in Saltash, Cornwall, before their eviction.
The dissident family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to the city-owned rental building after they had been evicted by terrorizing the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Cornwall, Saltash, after numerous complaints against couples.
When the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found the apartment in renovation condition shocked.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on the floors and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be able to be saved.
He says: “This has been a nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to become known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, as is its name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the fear of the family involved street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud shouting, quarreling and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received an anti-social conduct order in June.
Several rooms in the house under the demolition threat found old waste.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forced the couple out this week after giving them 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction – they said their life was an earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, “They didn’t care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
“The police have been here incredibly many times.”
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of enforcement at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly called in.
The trash and old toys had been thrown on the ravishing wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and family’s behavior, since eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall’s Housing Office is considering.
This case was very difficult, because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police, and to the members of the community who took part in the work and offered to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after being evicted
Housing workers now need to clean up the waste heaps surrounding the house.
The police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, along with scales and other supplies, as well as <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard of moving to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were cremated with graffiti.
Police say they demand evictions for tenants who violate the rules of rental agreements.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this evicted act as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without prosecution, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-swept military jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at an alarmingly low altitude.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a time when tourists were in a panic when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes almost to a contact distance from tourists who are sunbathing on a sandy beach in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The tourists got up on their feet in understandable concern about the thunder of the jet engines, which began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images of the dramatic past and the videos of vacationers on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: “It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down.”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at an astonishingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke from nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The first half of the year is better than expected.
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) made a better result than planned in January-June of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of Eksote was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to reduce the number of action queues.
Exote covers the deficit that was previously incurred by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border guards swear by a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military election of the Border and Coast Guard School’s conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The casting ceremony of the 10th special cross-border course was held in the sports field of the garrison.
Seventy soldiers were sworn in.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were selected as special pioneers.
250 of them were invited to participate.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans’ meeting in connection with the coup was attended by five veterans of the border troops during the war.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of bandit ahead - criminal intelligence helps clear up crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has been operating an RTA, the criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is Lieutenant Lahde.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilian clothes.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to the other police.
In Häme, among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less frequent for the police to leave the swamps only when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit of its own for each police unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Criminal Police, operates nationwide.
PTR units employ, as their name suggests, people from the Police, Customs and Border Protection Department.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas shared by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Exploration extends beyond its own territory
While a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
The investigation also extends beyond the boundaries of the institution itself, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert task database and observations to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author forms a certain picture.
Serialisation can be done either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not fully public.
Neither their own nor the methods used by criminals are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thereby trying to prevent police crime-fighting attempts.
The police will announce the methods publicly if they expect them to pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, reported in early summer, the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housing burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape into the outside door of the apartment, where they tried to see if the residents were really on the move.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest ones order the district court’s minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves in hand.
For the purpose of the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the East Finland Police Department, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyse information to help plan practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation gathers information from outside the borders of Finland and Finland.
London schoolgirl killed in Syria
The news reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasime Akunjee tells the girl’s family that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed by Russian airstrikes in Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and testament so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going to the war zone — and that will make people give up their decision to leave,” says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and took the bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and remained a widow just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court judge if he was elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's appointment after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
At a telephone conference on Thursday, Reid said he predicts Clinton will choose Garland with “almost a lot of certainty.”
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton’s team wouldn’t want to “wrong the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the main judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who block Garland’s name are presidential candidates for Donald Trump’s “commanders” and “deputies.”
Trump is not fit for office.
According to the journal Treats, nude calendars are as good for women as they are for men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of public secrecy models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity journal differs from the old school’s Playboy magazine because he said: “Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
Apparently, he thinks the same way about the calendar.
“We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity in which women, as well as men, can effortlessly enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body,” Shaw said in a press release on the calendar.
“Women certainly want to participate in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
As a template for the calendar, those who want to post their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York can also send them online.
Vinyl charm: who buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on your angry objection under the name ‘Not AllMiddle-aged Men’, this argument is based on real research data.
According to YouGov research company, there is no millennial boom behind the new arrival of much-spoken vinyl records, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, instead there is middle-age nostalgia behind it.
The person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely aged between 45 and 54.
Those in the age group 18-24 are actually the least likely buyers.
It is also not only the desire of amateurs to catch discs, but it is emotional: older buyers of vinyl discs are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But is YouGov’s results true?
If this blog had been televised, the camera would follow me as I walked along the bustling Soho Street, wearing an unscrupulous grey jacket dress. I would walk vigorously, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rosy, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs owned premises, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and character by observing.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at the moment eight middle-aged men, probably one woman in her twenties) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time exploring the range of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
“I think I am,” he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room walls, as shown in the photo. (Stuart sent me a photo by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is in part in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he couldn’t afford when they first appeared and re-buy things that he had to sell when he was young and without money.
“I’ll get a lot of stuff from the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” she says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been affected by the media hype. These people have heard of the re-entry of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“Based on the discussions I had, people had usually abandoned their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyls back,” he says.
This can explain the boom of vinyl-wrenched plants of certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the soundtracks?
In just a few seconds, a movement like Phonica realizes that they offer a comforting community to like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset about the uncontacted payment system.
The digital world may be dazzled by some of the vinyl fans, whose return to familiar disk enclosures means persistence and reminds us of the happy days of youth.
“I think it will sometimes fill a gap or acquire material possessions for some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
“I see it as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get ideas elsewhere.”
"We're like social workers!" whispers Wez's co-worker behind the sheet.
An ICM opinion poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion study also found that 41 percent have a turntable that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl buyers don’t have their own turntable at all.
At this point in the news, I would probably show a serious face while browsing stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl records is also accompanied by a "pocalyptic phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (at that time three middle-aged men).
“A customer recently came in and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny said.
“The proportion of such customers is not large, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers, who are just starting a hobby.”
The customer base is significantly more variable in Fopti, where I will arrive next. The business has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
Customers include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is gratifying, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous moves: instead of the buzzing jazz, the newest synthesizer pop from Wild Beasts is buzzing from the loudspeakers.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gruesome psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching a variety of discount discs.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is . . . . he lets a lovely sigh and continues:
“I can’t explain it, it’s so unique.”
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping on jeans but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and a daughter who are thinking about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase filled with discs from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key discs for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some are so high that they don’t even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all the means to get attention to these discs may mean more money in the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research shows that YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or working life.
They certainly don’t spend Thursday mornings playing chess at the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old television presenter who stares horrifyingly and blinks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to the shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 512 years in the study, a woman of five metres in length.
French court dismisses application for decommissioning of jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities calling for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in jungle camps inhabited by thousands of refugees.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dissolve the 72 temporary trades established for the refugee camp. The shops sell various goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts to the residents of the refugee camp. Temporary restaurants can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais prefectures, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other parties are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Court of Justice of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered Calais's prefect's concerns to be "fully understood".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants in the camp have a much greater meaning than simply providing food to people who “live in extremely volatile conditions.”
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors, whose status is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address requiring children’s cafés to be kept.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in the number of arrivals in the summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of over 9,000 people.
The price of food in Finland falls clearly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food prices are sharply reduced to the joy of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one per cent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen the second most in those EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
Compared to the UK alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest figures are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then followed by a twist, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
Russia’s bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia, are now pressing the price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Both S Group and Kesko have lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive food in Finland in the EU, which had a similar salary level to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell third of the cheapest food from similar countries.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparable countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, we must halve VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
A student returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all schools in Finland operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone must be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Somniosus microcephalus, known as Somniosus microcephalus, reaches the age of 150.
It can live after another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic bumblebee, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old.
The Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the pace of growth is slow, according to reports only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 miners trapped in fishermen's traps.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbonisation of the eye lenses.
The average age of sharks tested was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493-centimetre and 502-centimetre amazonians, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at this point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired at nearly 300 salespeople - no reduction in sales
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores is not reduced in order not to suffer from customer service.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann’s negotiations concerned some 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are to be realised in the coming year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the department store are in the background.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade continues to lose.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the goals set by the company.
“Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved the best second quarter of its turnover and earnings ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating profit of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there will be frosts in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north, there are 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete for the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Last year, Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup and is ahead of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was passing the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid he would be exposed,” the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium is in a state of emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for athletic medals, but the world’s top individuals were able to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was buzzing with cheering people.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, in the views of rugby, kayaking and horseback riding, thousands of empty benches have been seen.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the spectators were full.
After the Brazilian doubles, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators were full.
The bad news is, at least, that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian racer, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the organizers’ spokesman, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left for sale," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although they cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have fluctuated from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, because organizers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known sports such as golf and rugby to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty places at Rio Stadium this morning.
Even the beach volleyball with Copacaba sand has not interested the audience.
Jukka Kessalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem the rights of holders for money in the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land area is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of holder for a fee.
The holder is entitled to veto a block of 187 square metres, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the intended purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
Obtaining a right of control is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carry banderols or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The holder of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which allows for example a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of the rights appear on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the parcel data of the land area can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the activities of the Foundation will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land areas either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its activities through the sale of the rights of holders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turku - see the situation in your home country
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the worst of the big cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat determined the amount of bicycles and parts of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, police were informed of only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
That's the big difference.
“In other cities, there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” police inspector Tommi Reen describes.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
“The frequency of errors can be affected by how much people move around the city on wheels and how many wheels there are at all,” said Constable Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Finnish Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where city centres are far away from each other and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little more than 20,000 bike thefts per year.
That means 50-60 gallons a day, and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
“They’re a lot of them,” Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report of bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be reported.
A typical solved bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“There are also cases in connection with other investigations when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug-related apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists are caught on a weekly basis in connection with an act or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, inner yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually anywhere where they are normally stored.
As in previous years, the highest number of individual bike models are stolen.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the wheel for short-term own use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale, for example, via the Internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that stolen bikes would go abroad very much,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or offence.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a decent bike is sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries her colorful Nopsa all the time during her working day to the shelters of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five laps, but none has been stolen, says the Monster. "Never been taken, there has been a good monk."
“Perhaps this doesn’t attract thieves so much, there may not be any hipster value here,” the Helsinki-based Hirvi says.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike roped the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks its bike in a fixed, such as a bike rack.
“It’s going to be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student from Helsinki, who says about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you'll hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such sloppy-sloppy ones."
A year ago, a bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the housing company.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve was waiting for it to be taken.
Children under 15 years of age are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki is testing peer-to-peer crews familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer crew is tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
A peer-to-peer crew is missing the first crime a young man commits.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer crew will discuss what happened to the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer-to-peer crew to make up for his or her actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Young Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used side by side.
“Everyone directs young people’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn’t get ruined by the first mistake,” says Laitio.
A model from the United States, in which it is widely used, has been adopted for the purposes of the peer-to-peer crew.
The idea is that young people, after their first crime, do not go to the adult panel, but reflect on what happened to people of roughly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes committed by children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
“It’s been a message to continue on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to be diverted to the congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his recklessness, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor threaten to bring a sound wave to the Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-embellished anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico says the letter will be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from “people who want a party to protect their majority in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have corrupted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president, so that the American economy can do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is trying to be president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handhold for American duunars who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax,” Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I am opposed to all trade deals that work against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump’s Monday economic program for “just favoring millionaires like this.”
Trump’s proposal to reduce corporate taxes has been described by Clinton as “Trump’s loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of small businessmen whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s audience figures: the races have not glued Finns to the squares, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached the highest number of spectators.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population has been glued to the squares at their best: swimming on Tuesday night was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the one-month-old European Athletics Championships attracted nearly 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championship received a fair second million at a time.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports so far is the Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the race, which opened up to almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle sports manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures, and points out that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large number of television viewers choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, viewers are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s feudal events will come in Finland at nighttime.
Another reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now considers it a slim one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first race, the interest would have sprung up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of spectators at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the audience numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the first days of the competition on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're about 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get the numbers later on in the network,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena has had delays and other minor technical problems in its early stages.
Updated versions of the applications are available, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s canals and arenas than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe transmits races every day.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laboring for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
Since 2018, the Olympic sport has been visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre print in Ristisel, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonication.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters reach Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There could be unknown depths,” Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by a mean depth, it is the Great Lake of Juka, 23 meters.
In this way, your Päijänne will not reach the top ten, and Suvasvesi will be further from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax evasion: Pensioners’ taxation is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than that of wage-earners.
Ihalainen says that the issue was raised during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be respected after the election, he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter was heated by opposition representatives in the Parliament, who polished the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (OK.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.), the tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Orpo on their willingness to respect the competitiveness agreement reached with great effort.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government term.
It has been done with the help of labour market organisations, so it should not be called into question.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own confidence in the future.
Long-term unemployment in the run-off
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in the budget crisis.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is not taken into account, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in Thailand attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand during the time of Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions about caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently absent from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and to the referendum on the constitution of the military junta last week.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested who protested against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
She says the city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thailand Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police, according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died within 24 hours, after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular with Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was wounded.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today.
At least one of the two double-bomb attacks died.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than in South Thailand and in the city of Trang in both.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes them to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators was to destroy the country’s tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland calls on Finns in Finland to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is advisable to follow the instructions of the superstitious, Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and their victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has made it possible to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded as a sight near a bell tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Party wins women's four-match
Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships in Rio with permanno, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics to a degree over the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permanno championships three times in a row, as well as the boom in the last and the second year.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two World Team Championship titles.
The darker World Cup medals at Biles are from jumps and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombing on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more miraculous, according to Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. local time and said it's not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach have not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o’clock in the day, traffic in Patong had normalized, and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruunupy in Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who were suitable for identification marks hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately caught.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear setbacks
In Russia, the highest-ranking change of leadership took place on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and has served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been chained with other executives or screwed up.
Dismantling to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, will be assigned special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other positions and suggested that Vaino replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear downfall.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people on the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pyn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi of the Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the successor of Ivanov's place that Putin changes his circle younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields when they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus so that we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of vehicles where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over 90% of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants of the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and on the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Director of Communications at the Ministry says to STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in the last few years, Bolt has run against time during the contest.
From the beginning of the season, he broke his back and was forced to skip the Jamaican Olympic qualifying.
This hasn’t been perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included underdressed samba dancers and fans turned into journalists.
Reindeer around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter early stages of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down his injury and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors, despite the end of the jubilee, in the time of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career with a watch.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second low, but no one else believes it to be born but Bolt himself.
Bolt’s biggest challenge is Athens 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost at any time in the finals, if only he has made his way.
At the 2011 World Cup final, Bolt did not run due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set the final goal for his career at the World Cup in London next year.
These are the Olympic Games that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the lowlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio Reveals Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Failure
Chinese state news agency Xinhua said Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, had given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoxy hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadoo, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua reports that Xiny's sample on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also been revealed in Rio.
According to the BBC, Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoxy hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre-long runner Ferguson Rotich's helmet.
Phelps can't be stopped by anything - historic gold came into play style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in 200 metres for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold medal of the same sport in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the period before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, the BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read this week on the website of Iltalehti.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if there's a little noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and peculiar outfits.
Television is visual media, he says.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
There are no back steps, however.
It’s important to look good, and small trials are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to be agitated and perhaps agitated, but he insists that he does not want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It’s a rush from scratch if it comes from (the runner’s) clothing.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said Thursday they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
The police also arrested five other people and interrogated two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that was arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the Islamic State.
The detainees were reportedly inciting violence on social media.
Among other things, messages calling for violence had been distributed on the popular WhatsApp service.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after the package was detonated in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police had carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the package.
The audience did not reach the scene by the start of the match, as the police shut down the arena due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only let the public in the hall after that.
The game was a dreamy start to the Spanish team.
Spain, which started two defeats, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentinian lady banged Petäjä-Siren - Finnish contemplating protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful race day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren felt hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady banged Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was stranded because of the crash, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered a long-term protest.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
With the accident, the Finn left for 27th place.
The 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The crash on the tip didn't seem to work much.
Friday is an important day when the race starts from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says will prolong your life
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes, things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him additional years.
These include, for example, a tendency to moderate body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to squeal - just getting a milk can is enough.
The secret of a long life has been explored through many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented the seven most bizarre findings.
According to science, all of these things can lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with “a reduced risk of death,” especially in neurological or heart-related diseases.
Another study on alcohol claims that moderate use — from one to three meals a day — may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of the floss can extend a person’s life by up to six years, a study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can help with other diseases in other parts of the human body.
A study conducted in Norway showed how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring additional years, and there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solubility.
A study from the University of Oxford found that women with large hindquarters had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over the age of 65 found that a person who shops daily was probably less likely to be a shopping parent.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may predate death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunken drunk driving in front of a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car accident took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koske, in the middle of Koskenttie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived in front of it had hit the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stood up on its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
The woman, who was born in 1972, was pressed into her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 million.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Posti sent loose cannons to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s inventory of bulk sheets, as the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was buying loose candies from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit his eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulkheads, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If there was no rush in the lawn, the sign read.
The dealer’s foxy sign is related to Posti’s expansion of its services to grass cutting last spring.
The grass cutting is on offer at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me abstinence.
Media representatives have been playing all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to grab her own favorites in a bag of loose sheets, even though a few of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomi.
It was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Halti did not get angry at the sign because she found all of her own loose arch favorites in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, 30 kilos lighter, published a photo of her change

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss job in 2009.
She has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has collected a number of commendable comments from co-creators.
You're gorgeous, aren't you?
We are on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when you’re on the same journey, someone tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Do It Now project.
At the time, he told the evening newspaper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was about 10 pounds.
During the three-month exercise period, the kilos eventually fell by five.
Loviisa Murdered Woman's Family Wish: Victim's Memories for Police Dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by a donation for police dog labour.
Sipoo Veterinarian’s office has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the wish of the victim’s family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nurse training there.
Veterinarians remember her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless at work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donations go to the police dogs in their entirety, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening newspaper that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roosters.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know a woman and had no connection.
A police dog B<0xC3><0xB6>rje was involved in the murder, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
However, the burgeoning remains alive and is recovering.
District Court sentences Posti for violation of the Equality Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to train a temporary worker, the District Court of Kanta-Häme assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the share of the orientation during the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organisational decision to ban the introduction of the Finnish Postal and Logistics Union.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who violated the strike.
This was first reported in the People's News.
Turkey's return to the road to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini tell us that Finland has repeatedly brought to the attention of Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin resigns the head of his administration - replaced by Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close inner circle, will move to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin’s statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace Vaino, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant deal to ban games - not seen at the opening of the Premier League
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba’s ban followed in England.
Manchester United’s bid for Paul Pogba is out of the game as ManU opens its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros from Pogba.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left under a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings at the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s position as an internationally acclaimed event, starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
Festival wearers have typically expressed themselves with their own unique dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is being screened with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event do the authors themselves want to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities,” says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 in the last year by 5,000 people.
This year we will also see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been enhanced so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, which has been partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage stages, there will be a tent for 15,000 people this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little big crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Kallio is that even the big visions are now practically possible.
In the first years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the city of Helsinki’s support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, Flow's net sales to the limited liability company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creek things" such as the construction of the 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own unique outfit.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out from the content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, he is not the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was buoyed because it is probably the last time she will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and exploded with the help of cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a conservationist of wild animals living in Asia since 1989, tweeted a photo of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran up to me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was favored by Finns.
No one is known to be dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been heavily involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will go to battle first in a wartime situation
In the case of an acute war, the armed forces are not ordered to fight until several months after the military oath was sworn in, the Central Finn says.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible to fight in the event of a war.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve members of the emergency forces are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is commanded to a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became clear that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training the conscripts in the units of immediate readiness from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola Receives Huge Compensation for Home House
Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court’s ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple’s trial and liquidation for a total of EUR 47,344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was somewhat because some of the need to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers at the time of the sale of the apartment.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
In the court of appeal, Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a decent home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had an idea that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the circumstances mentioned in the health inspection report.
The health inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the cliff.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not clear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little in a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses was due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
In the western part of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
In the brush samples, mould or yeast that makes health risk possible, exceeding the limit values, was found in the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window hacker and the basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to change the apartment in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there had not yet been proper permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the court of appeal states in its judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
In a recent article by journalist Christopher Andersson, Dagens Nyheter writes that the National Archives of the United States of America, Maryland, has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from the Nazi-German breed agency.
The breed agency was under the leadership of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
Women’s background was studied by the Finnish National Agency, for example, through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "sustainable", and "good National Socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were prohibited by law, the museum’s website states.
Petäjä-Siren's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first round of Finnjollie’s day at the Rio Olympics, but remained at the top of the team’s tail in the second round of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for the RS:X class day starting at positions 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is the sixth.
In the 470th grade, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so stuck”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dance stages and festivals, continues to grow from the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, and is currently in a state of extreme stress.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and evil.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total height when he won the crown of the tango king at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen in a slightly different form.
The song "Satulinna" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book states that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stuck!
Sillanpää remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that had become a huge hit would not immediately be thought to have been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I’ve learned that you don’t have to ask yourself for perfection and excellence all the time.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up with the texts of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rmäs were not what Sillanpää wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but it was written based on the news in 7 days.
In the news, Jari and his ex-lover were told that Jari’s excessive partying and drinking was the cause of the divorce, but Jari said it was full of nonsense and was not true.
Jari called the record label in anger and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters voted in favour of the split and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though the polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The slogan of Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” flew a scrapbook in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curriculum
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation economists have for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the impression that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it will contribute to the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were struck by the BBC's neutrality, which gave the same amount of space to economists who supported only a few per cent of the EU's economic divide as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters are about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not, in their own opinion, have common interests.
While academics in large cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overwhelming profit argument was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant rushes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments were applied.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In every health center waiting room, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn’t exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, the victory of the camp in favour of the EU's withdrawal, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily listing of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below 10%.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the EU-friendly camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, less than two weeks after voting in the real estate market were quite quiet,” Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, they rushed into the situation and raised the issue to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started rolling, and the fund had to close its doors one after another.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually shut down trading, but instead changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worth pulling the money out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of it withdrew the notification.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds in Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably Attention to Real Estate Funds
According to Vanhanen, closures of real estate fund trades received an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds, which were subject to closures, control about four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could hold its fund for the half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slid downwards, but the situation does not look "righter" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit period.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% off.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down on the property market in London
Two o'clock in the morning, it didn't look so good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B’s side,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally silent at the office, sparked news, and the usually noisy crowd was completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell the story of his divorce.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you would never have thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, in midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared for the option well, and that is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins correctional process
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market was beginning to foresee drastic bills for the property market in Britain and London in particular.
London’s office premises were forecast to be down by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the mire has fallen, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show the last days of summer holidays on Vanhanen’s face this week in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what Brexit will bring.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been reported.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the mine was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index started to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, Vanhanen says.
All equally large falls occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
According to Vanhanen, the comparison is not quite right, because this is a crisis in Britain at home.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has now seen not panic sales such as those of that time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
The funding is normally available.
The repair could have been in front of us anyway.
In fact, the price-repair movement is no wonder for him - it could have been ahead of us even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of real estate in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the fall started really high.
London’s prices have been pushed upwards for four reasons, the Vanhanen list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will become globalized, Vanhanen says.
In the Middle East and Asia, new players have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city and an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has forced, for example, pension companies to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, debt leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, Disperse
In London, the rise in prices slowed down last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He dares not judge what is to come, but says that there is hardly any rising peak to be expected.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that we can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register purchase data more accurately
Soon S Group will know what you’re eating, as the trade group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its regular customers’ purchases.
When data on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to catch it in early May on products purchased as well.
S Group is following Kesko here, as the data of the goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to consent.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussomomi.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups, according to simple food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintantala, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group level data, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We haven’t gone to the level of K or S, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data included occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method are stored in the S-Etukortti purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terro and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cassettes anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador puppy vigorously sniffs five boxes of the same kind placed in a row in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog to play with her favorite game.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a jar of gas-inducing seals.
Ruutigas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online shop access
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work assignments may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg, Senior Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a military and explosive dog for Customs duties is the mails passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in connection with online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo, including weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In the harbours, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Finnish Defence Forces’ expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to choose from at the airport include slumping and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog has to deal with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close co-worker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle commands go to Heila from the one-time lattice.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanomas loses the camera’s mike cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cover immediately from the “irti” command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the working vest with the dog on, says Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who had never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision duties in Customs.
State gets its first Olympic medal - the people get their day off
The Olympic gold medal in Fiji, which has a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated 22 August as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the matter after the championship was closed.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was followed by a final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish picker fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter, Milko Tokola, succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one has been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos of thrust and 145 kilos of thrust.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to gain 175 pounds on the last one, as well as on the second one.
With the third company, the weights rose with a fierce scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting agreement with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 player agents.
Soon Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
The Prosa is expected to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people will meet with the Finnish master SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, the secular queen of last season, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star once again shrugs: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
As Alex Dunphy, who became familiar with the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter resurfaces with her proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his butt.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making her style and behavior much more daring.
The star has posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it out here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
At the time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television for almost her entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it seems to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years’ time, as the downhill is already so hard,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glowing young woman.
The Japanese prefer to visit Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start their Northern Lights trips already in the early autumn,” Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main attractions of Japanese Northern Lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter northern lights are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely do we know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues far into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the Northern Lights, making the vision two times fairy-tale, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land survey among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights of Finland, and according to Lind, the Northern Lights have huge potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby-7 race when Fiji's championship team won gold.
Britain’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby tournament was crushed when Fiji won it in the final at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday from 43 to 7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, transfers, side hustles, support game, running lines and raw force, and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little more than a lean comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first time in a rugby-7 tournament where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong win from South Africa’s Boxes in the 7–5 semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-strong team had been in full strength.
It may be a comfort to Britain that at least one Briton will receive a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former England rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been considerable for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and introduced its fighting skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had collided with a group of moving buses, and world champions rose to 5–0 when Osea Kolinisau made the pitch.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation was 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s stunning tackle prevented his witty Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn’t slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of playing, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, after which the UK lost 17–0.
Nakarawa scored the second goal after the first half of the game was over one minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the increasingly powerless struggles of the British team and crossed the finish line.
After the tie-off, the opening period ended with a situation of 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British were still in the role of apprentices.
Which is very true.
The United Kingdom made large-scale changes in half-time and managed to arrest the Fijians for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the excellent team game of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation 36–7 by scoring a goal in the left corner of the UK, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelagoers, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the auditorium.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s pure joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final touch to the Fijian cake by scoring the goal in the final moments.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semi-finals by 20–5, and the United Kingdom had reached South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the balance was settled by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of English rugby player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
The more emotional the gold could not be in these games.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed into history with 220 winning bets and found additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the aeros, the voice of coach Robin Williams was the third voice in the boat, which encouraged them to have their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's doubles, making them the first women in the history of British sport to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was indisputable, the victory for them was already 39th in a row, and once again record-breaking.
What we see, two brilliant athletes attaching to the surface of the water as swans age, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind every rowing bowl there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the achievement of the twins. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
“I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It will change the way we think.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky enough to be able to start their treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say in such circumstances.
“I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The row itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the two had thoughts at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome their own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal artillery regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: “At the emotional level, I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years have been fantastic for Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their rivals have not been able to compete.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the twins of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
“We were very busy in an instant.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It’s very important not to get off the road.”
“We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We didn’t aim for the sky today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did.”
The two are thinking a year before deciding their future.
Glover to celebrate next month with Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure.”
It took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed out.
This time it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to replace Panama leaked government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already demanded in the spring by protestors who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circulated taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-day rage of the people will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June, the presidential election showed clear criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest rumours.
He said he was sarcastic in asserting that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and Democratic candidate of ISIS, Hillary Clinton, as well as a member of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious at the talks and demanded an apology from Trump.
“The commander-in-chief of the army should never be allowed to let anyone who can sink like that down,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-populated burkini bathing suits on the beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a good habit and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which express large amounts of religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating France’s National Day.
At the end of July, two men linked to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-green clay has been observed on the P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococci bacteria in all bathing areas were below the limits set by the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had dropped below the action limits.
The blue algae deposits found in the bathing area of P<0xC3><0xBC>yk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi do not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue algae flowers, thus forming a blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water in the form of ferries.
Environmental action follows the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue algae precipitate turns into a blue algae flower, this will also be communicated separately on the beach notification table.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
Tax deductions are proposed for income taxes, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes of forest holdings is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the applicant will find something to criticise in the proposal for a tax change.
The forest gift reduction is presented as a task for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
VM’s proposal starts with a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry, which prevents the loss of capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell a tree.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit related to the yield value of forests is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, he said, it would remove 82% of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the space size.
According to Hakkarainen, a forest gift reduction has been carried out in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars crashed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special retreat on Friday morning at the Kalajoki Himanga.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars that ran in a row fell into a ditch, after which the person in the back collided with the time ahead.
Harri Pyhtiät, the firefighter of the day, said that the fall into the ditch was suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
In the back, there were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the cancer tumor increases the malignant nature of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’ family home death continues in court, prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
Muhos’ family home death continues in court for both convicted people.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for family home murder in Muhos.
The second received 8 years 4 months, including the murder and aggravated robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the killing was also convicted of a serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as a young person without rights.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the defendants and the man who had been convicted more severely.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been sentenced to a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a child protection unit at the school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was sentenced to death, allegedly attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The pilot had gotten out of his grip and had brought the young man into his room, and one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental study, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing at 156 years old
The world’s longest living vertebrate is a confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female is not growing until she is 156 years old.
The fact that it grows only one centimeter per year increases the life span of the ice shark.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The researchers found out his age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although throwing in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s change to corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced by tax breaks, which are particularly beneficial to the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency services must be renewed and the energy sector must be deregulated.
Barack Obama's health reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts rather than bureaucrats".
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organised protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists — including those close to the Republicans — see Trump’s program leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday.
A wave of shocks from the past - People's News
The sea is dying, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of Madrid's street vigil - accounting with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Lovers of Travel (2013) was a little fun and a rosque satirical comedy, the previous Skin where I live (2011) at the top of my career as a Spanish tourist.
Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between the two works.
It is a conciliatory love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and we see it as a long retreat.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta timed the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, appears in the second female lead role, as a TV friend from the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a rope, but I would say that time is audacious and literally with a one-time swipe.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance from Julieta to such a characteristic glamour.
It is a well-played, restrained, place in places with good music and a rather sadistic film with elements of elegance.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is there, and so that it slowly begins to put more into the eye as a pure form than as a functional dramatic effect.
People in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains just as flat.
This is especially true for the costume: in the case of a noun, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the eye-catching ears.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is to say, the tunings of the current scene, will not be improved in any particular way.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly spiritual.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a script based on three short stories by Alice Munro, a Canadian writer, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-weight literary filming.
The material would have been emotionally incomparable to a more gritty drama, so much of the big things - especially the sloppy guilt - are dealt with in the film's theme.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
With Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiered on August 12.8.
The government is trying to win the election - People's News
No new cuts will be made, they say, so that the Finns will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out with a lot of trade.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This convinces Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (cook) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because the social security cuts were already decided in the spring spending limits.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefits is reduced from 500 days to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipalities haunting
Why are ministers so keenly emphasising the fact that no new cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the Gallup.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election, which takes the parties of the government in different directions, will spoil the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup, however, reports that the Prime Minister’s party expects the Finns to lose, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new councillors, most of whom will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the government of three parties of roughly the same size is based on the fact that the position of the Finns will last.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted in the party have had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
There will be no new cuts in the rhetoric, firstly, to confuse the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, to try to soften the blow waiting for the Finns.
Large cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the target of debt reduction during this parliamentary term, but the budget proposal for Petteri Orpo will take up EUR 5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: the debt does not bend or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even more cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, the parliamentary elections will take over what will happen.
With these measures, the debt will not fall.
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be overcome, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the information conference on the budget prove it irrefutable:
The forecasts for growth in the global economy have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade and has extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be virtually completely covered by new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the Finns as to what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also imposes responsibility on the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic studies, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with disabilities are the most important goals for the county.
There is no transfer of any of the responsibilities of the municipalities to the state.
The underage drunk ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol to Ilomantsi on Friday night at half past midnight.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man left to drive the police at a fair speed.
The race continued on Sonkajanranta road, from where it continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-legged police officer ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
He also did not have a license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo crashed into a ditch
The truck in Kivilasti fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell to its side in a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the responsibility of the owner of the car to lift the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was poured onto the road, which was absorbed by the rescue service into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki’s Lahti village in southern Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 centimetres tall, slender and well-groomed and has white hair under her chin.
Observations and clues about missing movements are requested by calling the emergency number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The elements of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery Parafest's destruction
The surge that fell at the Parafest Festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed on the Market Square at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 pm.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is the Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The eavesdropping flow occurs in the thunderstorm cloud when the rainwater and its weight trigger the falling air flow.
Changes in the state of water in the upper cloud bind heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and its rate towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the eavesdropping currents.
The rush flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were destroyed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were injured in the accident.
There was one child among them, who was transported slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution is ageing the Londoners.
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The study was conducted by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses London’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people living in London is two and a half years older than that of people living in rural areas, for example.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who walk around busy streets on their commutes.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes betrayed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard by a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor fell on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the extent that he was taken to the central hospital seriously injured in further investigations.
The tractor did not have time to go further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays for the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from a better starting point than the men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tune is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Riento’s main coach, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and united.
Fred Musoni, a middle-backed foreign trio, begins his second term at Riento.
The new faces include 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passari, Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimeters.
through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoi to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Floorball Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better in the North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, the kind of sport that was played on the SM level was not yet played as a salibandy.
The game was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoja in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the SM-series of the 1991-92 season with the University, the following three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminating in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series for 10 seasons, with a balance of 169 in 51+34=85.
The latest season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen appointed to national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolainen-based Tatu Väänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on November 6-8.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who is attacking Erä in Helsinki, has played six men’s country matches, where he has accumulated a total score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from travel problems and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 country matches.

The main coach of the team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to end as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley’s Finnish championships will be decided this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, the medals are played in both adult and young series.
In co-operation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, six best pairs of each series will be qualified for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäki NMKY’s raised Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the auditorium this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the Pesisstadion.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu's spark for sport and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are many memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 with Elimäki’s NMKY E-girls.
The top one is too big a toy shirt in mind, knee pads on the ankles and huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of sport in junior years to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
Bits have been played on the beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors’ championships, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksämäki’s Anniina Parkkinen in SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
The real goal is to have a medal.
SM gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toes will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The high tide poured tents at an event for disabled people in Joensuu, the big accident was near
The eavesdropping flow poured out three tents at Parafest Festivals for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a big show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 p.m.
Firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by a Karelian, tells the newspaper that there were elements of a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
Young farmer Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and her younger brother, Valtteri Koli, began working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yardyard, and at first the bank was not too excited about it.
However, I went into the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the competition for a young food producer in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote on the newspaper’s website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria’s monthly inflation was 1% in July.

The annual average inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 % compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 an increase in the prices of the following categories of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and training.
Snapchat’s anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, around 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identities in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are unauthenticated, feature-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received criticism for favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty product.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into crooked, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions point to a bigger problem that the company has with its differences.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, and it was written by online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced that they had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of insulting stereotypes.
Some of them resented the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely shared in pictures, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and embarrassing.”
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the comparison of a highly tasteless Asian caricature with the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but a one that has been taken to degrading extremes."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience is made up of young people who are ethnically more diverse than their parents’ counterparts. This may mean that they’re likely to expect more discretion.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates a picture that offends the user, things like this don’t go unnoticed as before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published in the medium, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s leadership, mostly white men, and ended his writing with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It is either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, so that they can make decisions like this, or that they also have colored people as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its spokesperson, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promote inclusion within the company.
Zhu, for his part, says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.”
According to a congressional expert group, military officials distorted intelligence on ISIS
A report was released Thursday by a congressional team of experts that said U.S. military officers, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave the cause to understand.
The Republican presidents of the House Armed Services Committee established a working group to report on the “general discontent” of military intelligence analysts. Analysts said the senior military officials were embellished by estimates of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in short, Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior executives of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S.'s counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the field showed, and were, without exception, more positive than the analysis of other units of the intelligence community," the report said in a press release.
“The events of Centcom are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering as high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses,” California Republican Ken Calvert said.
"Centcom's management team's mistakes go to the top of the organization."
A 10-page report detailing the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops include.
Even though the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by Obama’s administration were forged, it gives analysts an idea that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command’s press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than what actually happened,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a major military assault on Mosul’s recapture could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior U.S. military intelligence leaders manipulated the intelligence findings to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after they learned of the suspicions that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated by analysts.
The report, which was published on Thursday, follows more detailed results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House of Representatives' inquiry committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, senior Democratic Representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "scheduled the publication of intelligence results, "inflicted the morals of analysts" and "considered insufficiently divergent views."
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to a "pre-determined or political official line".
The Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional study on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon’s Superintendent, which began as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
He says, however, that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the Intelligence Community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.”
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (altering claims from several defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust Central Command and that it will provide honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
Criticism of intelligence on ISIS is consistent with disagreements over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that, despite the protests of many analysts, President George W. Bush’s government supported only small numbers of troops in Iraq and took little time to reflect on what would follow from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against IS intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, Hooker's task force concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not passed outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom’s then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many lawmakers had judged the testimony given to the Senate to be too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
U.S. wins fourth duel in women’s country hockey and consolidates its position in a mid-term review with Britain
After scoring three goals in a win-win match, in a 6–1 match against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women’s national team on Thursday, when the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
“I have no idea,” he said.
“I’m not one of the people who keep track of the paintings they make.”
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament, lost zero games, and shared first place in their group with the UK, which continued its victory streak after winning Japan in 2–0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the final round of the first round.
Both teams survived the final, which determines which of them will be the first and the second of the six teams.
The first-placed avoids long-term encounter with the hard-hitting Dutch team, which won the second block.
No matter what happens in the game on Saturday, the Americans have already raised the issue of their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up his country hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sister played the game at Drexel). He reached the national team at the age of 16 and was the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he didn’t make it to the final player list.
After that came the 2012 races, in which he and his team did not see much success.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, spiritual and physical,” Bam says.
“Our job in London wasn’t what it is now.
We have made a full translation.”
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a fist.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1–0 position until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, swirling to the midfield, hitting the ball to the finish line, thus taking the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth season.
The game was the first in the tournament, where the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal blank. In the first three games, the American goal had been sunk in each one hit.
Briggs is now living his success.
Same as Bam.
“Our location is now good,” says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic rush, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of place and time, the Olympics are inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to follow as a passionate message all the time and everywhere.
It’s as if the Olympic fire itself is a flaming signal that moves from the archer to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnast, and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or a dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-timer Dooley charms with his smile and might well have a name on everyone’s lips that would appear and be in the best time to watch and listen, would be preferred by sponsors, and would appear in good minds in TV ads if he were just a swimmer, gymnast, or even a sword.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for the Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all competitions on an equal basis.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are less well-known sports such as air pistol, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Although athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never won the medals and never made it to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side to the medal are the two Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan defend gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics in the uncivilized ear.
(I recognize that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has a comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless booming scenes of the characters, but it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming jumps, i.e. in species that are essentially combined in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means "battleboard".
Ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements, such as twists, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty level and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics. Among them there are 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
When aiming for gold, the medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reporting weapons, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough even to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just to watch the games.
This trampoline offers a rest period.
Trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and swings back up effortlessly.
Of course, the species also has a competitive aspect, and it’s not easy either, but it doesn’t involve rushing to the goal or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as an Olympic competition can get.
Women’s qualifying matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men’s equivalent races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the middle of Olympiamania, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the middle of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering male athletes to be seen and objectifying them, as recently suggested by the U.S. male gymnasts in the Wall Street Journal, then Logan Dooley is just looking forward to his new fan base.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly disbanded demonstrations in various parts of Ethiopia demanding political change.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to increasingly large areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of the demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces are beating up young people who are forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights officer is now calling for in-depth research.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, Research Director, International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa’s second largest country, and its stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and very few African countries, if anything, receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital city of Addis Ababa is even a new agglomeration.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still a long way from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the government's repressive policies, the opposition in the country is very limited, and dissidents are rapidly suppressed.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
“If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their mind, it will erupt,” says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“The whole young people are showing their minds.
A whole generation is protesting.”
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, from land use to the government coalition’s punitive stance.
After last year’s widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies received the last place that had previously belonged to the opposition, and as a result, they now rule the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the border with Eritrea, where hundreds of deaths were claimed in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why a bitter mood that has been under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, when cheaper smartphones became commonplace and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many still access the Internet via proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to the demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest populations, the oroms and amhars.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
Ethiopia’s mostly Christian highlands have long dominated the country’s politics and business and exploited oroms, most of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
“Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population, and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
Analysts said he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors to reconcile the differences between the counterparties.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says Abdi, a conflict researcher.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles's shoes from near-unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigre-managed security forces.
Many people fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first bullied and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, although fewer were killed than in the previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment towards the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented the strengthening.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked companies owned by tigers, and hate speech against tigers is becoming more common on social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighboring Somalia-watched aircraft, but the base has recently been closed, according to the U.S..
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already unstable region to collapse.
“This requires a strict balance,” says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull back his words in a dispute over his latest campaign, claiming that he wasn’t serious about claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton repeatedly this week to be the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidate during these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant, are also in a difficult situation.
Trump made a statement at an election ceremony on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President Clinton and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump turned his speech on Twitter completely from the day before, when he said that he had been very serious about his accusations in several interviews.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism rose when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy as the numbers of supporters fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy line speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself against sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to prompt the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump narrows the boundaries of political speech and withdraws his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then “clears” in one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different sieves.”
Instead of softening his statements to the electorate, Trump has in recent days made his style even more intense as his numbers of supporters have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll published on Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist reported that Trump’s support is significantly lower than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after ever more careful scrutiny in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a awkward position where they are forced to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the presidential candidate vigorously in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I consider his words to be a legitimate, political speech,” Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called the “lower-series team” and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its activities when it did not deal with the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of squeezing his speeches and discriminating against him.
He ridiculed “unworthy and pitiful” television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says he cannot succeed in it.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s explanation and said it would only show more clearly that he was not fit for president.
The coffee shop that closed due to an excessive rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly sloppy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the café was priced out of its streetside location on Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonably high.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
Locals consider this under middle-classization to avoid the loss of a fallen café to be pathetic.
The artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe there’s no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-potato-cheese-sandwiches and capers and fried onion rings to fill.
The list also includes dark-billed flowers.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After holding the café for nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed that old regular customers have started to visit Verb as a steady stream.
“Also, many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
When he moved to Greenpoint, he made walks to Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he said he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized I liked Verb’s coffee and culture,” he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai blend instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a list news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same without exception.
“I walked into the café about seven o’clock a day, like a machine, and there they were already making my butterbags with all the fillings,” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders its standard product, but from time to time he varies between bacon, egg and cheese fillings in his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't like the fact that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verbi’s own cold brewed coffee.
“We may still take the offer,” Rodriguez says.
The Poles, who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint, have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee at the café.
The café may also expand to the next building.
However, for many customers, it is enough to get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the café was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had come home,” Whitt says.
"I missed the smell of the cafe."
The Great Depression’s Tough Food in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary Master, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver abscond and Maryland tortoise soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert from a plum pudding.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for the people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a block of flats in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, depicting the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to a meeting with a journalist at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the big stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich filled with cream cheese and olives, and Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple said it would fit into a very big conversation about eating a layover.
“The bruises were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate peanuts, livers, and popcorn.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe's making fun of me.
“It must have been pressed in the stomach like lead,” he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, operated on the buffet principle "to eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, freshly baked pies were served.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
“This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, riddled dishes such as crumbs and potades became the main food, and patarook was said to be “a great way to use food stars” because chefs could cover up non-attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the most important part of an American meal, became a sparsely used luxury.
We tried strange blends, where the most important thing was meeting the calorie and nutritional values and not so much the taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven onions filled with peanut butter as a snack dish.
"It didn't gain popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman added: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion do not match at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Bureau of Households from 1923 to 1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be precise budget keepers, and to face the challenge of making tasty dishes from pies like carrot-creamspaget.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic macular events.
Particularly tasty are reports of the reaction of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on a farm in Iowa, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated master who had become him.
“He liked the continental kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce,” says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring but also the worst-made in Washington.”
Many of the food of the recession was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and dietary intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple, writing the book, began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she could not throw away food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” says Coe.
“People even started to get sick of his food,” recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one of the wind hats."
After the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought up their home-made plum dessert, the one that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
“It’s called plum foam,” says Ziegelman, adding that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly put our spoon in a thick brown rag.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe sang for the second time and the third.
“German nuts would make this better,” Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead's full reimbursement of attorney's fees for patent dispute with Merck on hepatitis C medicine
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a full reimbursement of the legal fees it received for a legal dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. regarding a patent for a hepatitis C medicine.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million for violating two Merck-owned patents related to successful pharmaceuticals known as Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. A judge in the United States found that Merck committed violations, including misdeeds and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman, Judge of the U.S. Regional Court, said Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it was charged to defend the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the right to private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed troops have taken Manbij city from ISIS
U.S.-backed troops have seized the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, in northern Syria, after the last Islamic militants left the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now tearing up the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
A spokesman for the SDF's Manbij Military Council, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal tax
On Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, which shows that her and her husband’s income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charitable organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly 5.3 million dollars in speech commissions, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book, which dealt with her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice president, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton have announced 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to look like a model for economic transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
The U.S. presidential candidates have always published their tax information, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit and say it’s the reason Trump hasn’t disclosed his income data.
“The transfer is yours,” Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s Special Envoy Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax information until the checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has tackled this issue and posted a video online on Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who push Trump to publish their tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in an economic speech in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, and not his public tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to the Politico newspaper, Trump did not pay taxes at all or pay little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
At a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, with Berkshire Hathaway headquarters in the same location, sued Trump for a meeting where both of them would disclose their tax information.
Buffet says he has also been subject to a tax administration audit and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was earned.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income amounting to $109,000.

Chili-filled cranberries in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation – elephants are harassed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign together with the American Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers from the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to alarm the elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“After developing the method, we’ve seen attitudes change in these villages, because now the villagers can count on being able to keep the elephants out of their fields without damaging them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is alarmed by pointing a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this does not work, discard the so-called chili cloud.
The mixed chili powder in the soil is put into the condom together with the spark plug, after which the head of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition wire is left outside.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last means is a thrower that shoots the fireworks known as the Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticized a Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s dial code from the Arab “incitement” – RT News
The French film director, whose roots are Jewish, gave birth to the media rage after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention Israel’s country code number in its country list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, unraveld his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of directions provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Kempinski Bristol, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to call Israel via a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's reply shocked him.
The receptionist said the removal of Israel from the list was “a decision carefully considered by the management of Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the operation further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for Israel’s number to be removed.”
Israel’s German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the incident was “a great disgrace.”
“The incident is shocking and shocking to all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is precisely the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the ambassador said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Damn” was said in a publication that pointed out the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"No direct order was ever given for Israel to be removed from the code list," wrote a spokesman for the hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
The students teamed up with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to protest the reforms of the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the student population, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to demonstrate their dismay at government plans participated in the demonstration.
Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has made a proposal for a savings measure, in which nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300,000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who was in charge of the presidency.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with disfellowshipped President Dilma Rousseff's supporters, while the country's Senate voted on the charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
After the lifting of the sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan says.
According to him, Russian companies’ interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
“Russian companies are continuing their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further growth in trade is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries,” Dzhagaryan says.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign mission in Iran granted Iranian citizens around 35,000 visas, most of which were travel visas.
For the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Skottti Callum Skinner wins British cycling gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland claimed fame in the men's team sprint at Rio Velodrome last night, when the British trio defended the 2012 title in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow was an anchor he inherited from his compatriots Scottishman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud to thank him for the goal and to win the victory from a team in New Zealand that was considered a favourite.
Four years ago, Hoy won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had only finished sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his racing career also left a hole that Kian Emaadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man that British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British triple won gold in a duel.
Hindes was a bit behind after his round, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove at a higher rate to slow down the pace, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached out to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old in Glasgow, says, “I’m flattered by the parallelism.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There’s no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track due to a bad start.
He later withdrew his words, and the British competitors had no means of appeal.
This time, there were no such problems associated with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says: “The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were flimsy in the audience.
Our team has been united over the past three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is an indicator of progress over the past five months, five days of velodrome are ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean an increase in the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyt and was also born on March 23 (a magical date for British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, starting today and ending in three days.
28-year-old Kenny from Bolton says, “At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team racing is always the best.
You can enjoy the win with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the knight's value."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owai Doull were the fastest four-man teambacker ever.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (at 22:42) will be raced today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the contestants before the race, when the contestants invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record 4:13.260.
The UK team can now count on its awesome cycling team to take over the mid-Olympics and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
Following the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the contests held on the first night with the Velodrome show that the British already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment will come true once again.
The future of the Portland smelt plant is at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelting plant said that one of the plant’s owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision made earlier this year by the Victorian government not to continue the subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
A solid, 20-year-old grant will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk of disappearing from the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of the redundancies.
The snowball effect may continue to increase as the smelting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's smelt plant, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelting plant loses money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelting plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other smelting plant owners will also terminate their contract.
The plant is majority owned by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical electricity demand from the smelting plant will continue.
AGL says the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period is 12 months and will expire in 2017.
“As such, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential profit effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market outlooks in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million “in anticipation of the termination of the contracts.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL’s Chief Operating Officer, said in a speech to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
As a producer, that would not be good news for us,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality TV star Kendall as cover girl of Vogue in September
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the American Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and appeared on fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover photo was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashian style?) scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Barbers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) and they forgot their sister’s cover photo.
The plot is cliché and is used in almost all of the birthday episodes of the sten programs (Seacrest says the words: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character of the children's morning TV), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
Its appearance in Vogue’s September issue undoubtedly marks a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have filed for Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own category.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling release in a year.
The number, which resembles a big picture book more thick than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashion reported that last year’s 832 page display had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue cover star is so eagerly expected that in the two previous years the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover designs for September included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more model-working celebrities on the deck than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior commercialist Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and even if he would rather be among the celebrities who are working on the model, he is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, true TV stars or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyoncé, who appeared in the cover photo last year, has one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be a bit of a nuisance.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "marriages".
These feelings have resurfaced as news of Jenner’s performance on the cover of Vogue emerged.
However, the constant outburst of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's an advertising face for Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn off 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable in the country are being expelled from justice centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact of further cuts in appropriations on centres already operating at the border.
In the state of Queensland, already three out of five people who apply for free legal aid and legal services are expelled – most of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, said thousands of people are being turned away from the centres every year, according to the latest report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government does not roll its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away when they seek the services they need,” Farrell said.
“People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unjustly dismissed workers — all have problems with legal affairs, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately dispense with these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of the public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.”
Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued when no action was supposedly taken after its leadership was told that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit brought by former state campaign software instructor Vincent Bodini on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, according to his own words, he realized that this would not happen.
Brodini says in his complaint that campaign leader Earl Phillip “takes out the pistol, puts his right forefinger on the trigger and pushes the barrel into Vincent’s kneecap.”
According to the complaint, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Mr Bodini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“Even if the weapon is not launched, it will cause damage,” says Bodini in his complaint.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general outrage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional section" - which are considered gun owners and gunmen - can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets the judges elected.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his words from the context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demands compensation from the campaign for the indifferent cause and Phillip’s reparation for overcrowding, ill-treatment and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte’s local news agency, WCCB, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call request submitted to Phillip’s consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has had a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bardini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow, and as we did at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, we made a huge effort to make sure that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles to be overcome will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and to grow the economy by <0xC2><0xA3> 211 billion, bringing skills and employment to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a powerful team that has implemented on time and within the budget an infrastructure investment programme of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
Now they are ready to produce the third runway, supported by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the board of directors of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertise on Cat Mouse
The efforts of companies that earn their money from online advertising to distract advertising-prevention software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blocking programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it told users that they could update their anti-blocking software filters and thus again block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad tag codes for its desktop site, making it more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says it has cleared the new codes.
Adblock spokeswoman Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that “such a balling-up between the open-source ad-blocking community and the scammers has been going on ever since the ad-blocking was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair business again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad-blockers, according to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, the figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading ad-blockers in its desktop app, as the spokesperson says mobile ad-blockers don’t work on Facebook mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it will update the user settings ad tool so that users can more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters as they also prevent some common Facebook posts from appearing.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Ad-restraint programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that’s why instead we’ve invested in developing user settings such as ad tools so that people can control ad targeting themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by abandoning cars on a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of eyewitnesses from an accident on the motorway in the first hours of Thursday, in which the woman was deliberately abandoned under several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate job by lying on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her aim was clearly to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified. The police ask them or other witnesses to report the accident.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's up to the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have taken place, on the basis of which motorists are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was released from the charge against him, who had been charged with death penalty after he had come across a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking a lot of alcohol and had gone off the road.
The court held that the way the police — which was responding to an emergency call — were justified, and the man lying on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation.”
Anyone who knows anything about the incident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model to study Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations, the slow rotational speed of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
“With the GISS modelling, Venus rotates slowly, and its daytime is almost two months at a time for the sun,” said lead author Anthony Del Genio, a researcher at GISS.
This heats the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
When hydrogen ran into space, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained – that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club’s hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Colorado vice president/director Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been working as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club’s hockey operations with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I’ve been thinking for a long time and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice president of the club’s hockey operations must be on the same line with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year for his first season as the head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 points in the 2015–2016 season and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card spot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and end the strike
The main negotiators report that the North Sea oil workers’ payrolls will be suspended when all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, an oilfield service provider, has been subject to strikes on drilling rigs in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several full-day meetings during the coming weeks, where we will address the issues of fresh perspectives.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which, according to them, was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its North Sea contractors’ tariffs by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the country in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts give it the necessary space to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to enhance its operations after its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union create pressure for energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest conflicts that have been experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” Anderson says.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian star cluster
The most recent task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian star cluster so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to find out why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other clusters we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system,” says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech University’s infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster have been born around 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching adulthood.
They are currently spinning faster than ever.
With the speed of rotation at its peak, large quantities of the adult stars erupt from the star winds.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by observing the time between the appearance of the recognizable starspots (which correspond to the sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – bigger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
“We see from Plejad’s ‘dance’ that the slow-rotating ones are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating ones are typically very light stars,” says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars in relation to rotational speeds.
“The Pleiadian star cluster provides a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiadians in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
