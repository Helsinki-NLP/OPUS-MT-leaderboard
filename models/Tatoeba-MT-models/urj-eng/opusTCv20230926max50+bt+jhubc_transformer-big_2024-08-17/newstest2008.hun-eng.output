European inflation has fallen on food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in 13 countries in the euro area, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, according to the Luxembourg statistical office.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the basic interest rate, saying that the reduction would lead to inflationary spirals along with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate close to 2%.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in its twenty-two traps: "to talk about" inflation so that it doesn't have to act on this topic later.
In Germany, inflation of 3.3 percent in November is a twelve-year record, and in Spain it has risen from 4.1 to 3.6.
Inflation in the euro area has been pushed up by rising food and energy prices.
Future wheat notes have risen 88 percent and soy bean prices have reached the highest value since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the cost of food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of oil on the world market increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent this year in 2008, but will decline to 1.9 in 2009.
Analysts estimate that the level of 12-month inflation will remain at around 3% over the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will have reduced interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz’s supporters grew significantly by the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such low 13 percent socialist support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71%) of the MSZP’s one-fifth (20%) support, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support for the whole population is 2%.
The supporters of both camps are one percent more among the voters.
The economic climate has deteriorated further to the previous low – it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who have found the country’s economic situation to be particularly bad, while 46 per cent say the situation is rather bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation after the more hopeful outlooks of spring and summer.
For the next year, the larger half of the population will expect further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than 71% of Gallup’s previous polls said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or very much trust, while in Viktor Orbán, 38 percent are supporters.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all, 27 per cent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much part of society thinks that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable to remain after the riots in October last year, at present this figure is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution to the new elections.
In a referendum, 60 percent of respondents said they would leave and another 20 percent said they would probably leave.
In comparison, only 55 per cent would be sure to take part in a “now Sunday’s parliamentary election” and another 15 per cent would consider it likely to take part. The result of the referendum would not be questionable based on the current intentions.
74 per cent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 per visit, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
If we only look at the same rates among those who promise to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition, fees and hospital fees.
The most expensive Auchan, raised almost a fifth of Tesco
In the trade triangle of Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs, hypermarkets kept last year’s average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, the ordinary Christmas basket of the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle grew by an average of 16 per cent, but in each hypermarket, there was a growth in value well above a thousand forints.
Since last December prices in food stores were already "depleted", there was no longer a drastic increase in the percentage of the previous high base.
However, it is clearly frightening for consumers that what they could get at 9,000 forints last year is not even worth 10,000.
The Daily Basket crossed the ten thousand forints psychological boundary with at least 91 forints in the hypermarkets examined.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003 the basket was sold for 6,800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy were also very expensive.
The price of flour and bread was followed by KSH’s data in stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not print the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the two-liter returnable bottle Coca-Cola was under 200 HUF, so together with the deposit fee, they asked for only 257 HUF for the product.
This year, however, Auchan was the most expensive in its Daily Basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora 15, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, and Tesco and Auchan increased their daily basket prices by about 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and the most expensive one was 21 percent.
There were an average of 1,480 increases in the forint.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1206, so that last Christmas the price increase was felt.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, apparently the stores could not decide how much margin they would apply to a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If a product’s rotational speed is poorly planned by the trader, it can be of great benefit to the price range adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
Due to the VAT, the price increase of the Daily Basket was so extreme last year that the price difference was the most expensive 1720 HUF more than in 2006, while the price difference was only 844 HUF at the cheapest.
This year, this extreme did not show up, as the most expensive one was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and in less than 20 months, daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the HCSO: the statistical office has increased the price by more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months for some basic foods.
In addition to the flour, for example, the egg.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost absurd for the latter, as the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, produced a price increase of just over 10 per cent compared to the base, in the worst case scenario.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg-eaters, and the drastic price increase was also tricked by the multinationals.
In the trading gold triangle, the hippies do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, most of the customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the durable food with plat<0xC3><0xB3>st<0xC3><0xB3>.
On Wednesday morning in all three stores there were serious queues in front of the cashiers, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that there is less traffic in rural areas, and more people are complaining to research companies that they are not even behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they save on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of the hospitals, the clutter of the beds, the overburden of the staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the head doctor of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
After a serious accident, a man found a bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
He was released from the hospital in a serious car accident, but soon after he had to return with MRSA infection, and since then he has not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
This year, until 10 December 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, head of the department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly resistant bacteria against antibiotics, which is rapidly spreading under inadequate hospital conditions.
In the case of transient or persistent failure of the immune system, in patients with a weakened body, elderly or low body weight, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the day-to-day practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the disease, MRSA is not only there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“We isolate such patients, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital are initially examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
I don't like sampling.
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favorable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz says.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should monitor incoming patients and should immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies.
Most cases are thus made public when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, the head physician of the epidemiology centre said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed in order not to develop resistance to drugs, but this is not always observed in hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads most frequently from one patient to another through the mediation of health care personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves, the use of masks plays a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in this in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by drip infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the hospital rooms are often crowded, often very close to each other beds, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, it can also be seen, noted Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, that in hospitals in unfavourable financial situations, they save on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is even more chance of infection.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is less evidence of such an infection or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Managing the MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurers, and they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, he included in the government program the prevention and reduction of MRSA.
It appears that the program is successful, according to the data reported, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
There was no drunken police officer causing a fatal accident.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the 21st District Police Commissioner has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that he would have been driving drunk or in a debilitated state, the 21st district police captain who had resigned from his post on Tuesday, who was driving a pedestrian to death, informed Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office, on Friday after the expert opinion had been drawn up.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which already found that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
At the time, the head of the 21st district precinct hit a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing site with his own car on Tuesday, while turning around on Kossuth Lajos Street in the 21st district.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not cross over to the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance under the rules of the GREECE, the winding car driver must still give priority.)
The infantryman died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the district police chief resigned his post and asked for his retirement, according to police reports, because the incident shocked him so much.
The Budapest Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit framework agreements supporting education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy, worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EDB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which a loan agreement of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, the agreement that has just been signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also provides budgetary funding for education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, we also discussed Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to the question of whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of €8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans shall be provided by the EIB with a grace period of 8 years and without any maintenance fee for EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed to the little-known Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU is still the cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular property purchase destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the Golden Beach, the Napospart, the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will attract investors – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people are also buying in the area of the extremely cheap Rusz.
The capital, Sofia, also boasts attractive opportunities, and commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so besides the summer and winter season, it should be a top destination in the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying heavily, for example, in the area of Bansko.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Residents or renovated properties are bought for between €50 and €100,000, or abandoned old houses for €5 to 15,000, and then renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a large city, shops and in general the proximity of the local doctor.
The second category is for holidaymakers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium to long-term value growth.
The growth of the capital’s real estate is continuing, as demand is increasing.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but have increased by 21 percent per year over the last five years.
The rise in real estate prices is fundamentally higher than the increase in payments.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percent
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be closed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to reduce emissions after the Kyoto Protocol period until 2012.
At present, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not wish to negotiate precise figures at the moment, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will undertake to provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
There is also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, as provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected to be within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), says Market and Profit.
6% of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to preserve the role of the flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is prepared to reduce it by up to 30% if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol overall set a reduction of 5.2 percent, including the EU - then another 15 - committed minus 8 percent.
Hungary’s obligation to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period 1985-87, which our country will comply with.
There is a high stake in Bali, as the long-term international climate agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be delayed after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by another international emission reduction system, which the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize winner, has pointed out in its latest report on climate change.
This would delay emissions reductions and avoid an increase in the Earth’s average temperature above 2<0xC2><0xB0>C, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
Films of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being released on video sharing by British Army units to promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) got YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These images, taken with a miniature helmet camera, are checked by the Air Force's command of operations in Hendar and sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the Hungarians.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already received 139 images in this form on the Internet, and more than 75 thousand have viewed their "channels".
The UK Department of Defense registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Corps (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The original intention of the Air Force was to record the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to introduce to the general public the true purpose of the army’s foreign presence.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to the traditional television recruitment ads, said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert for the BBC, but it also carries some political message, as it proves the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government in a particular way.
The Americans made a game.
The military is also concerned that in addition to carefully crafted, censored footage, amateur videos will be added to the divisor, showing the death of soldiers, for example: in slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers will talk about the losses at most, but they will not show the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos of Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the Internet, which were made on sharp missions, but the British army has only recently received them.
In a slightly different way, the Americans recruit a free-to-download shooting game called America's Army, in which the player can sneak right into the skin of the soldiers in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's gonna be a mound and a cake-cake Christmas at the Ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of having a Christmas party, he will hold a year-long workshop for his colleagues, who will be able to thank him with cake and coffee from 2007.
There is a ministry where there will be a live music party, and elsewhere they will create a Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of officials by sipping and sipping.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - making fun of the power.
State agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest ministerial Christmas party will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but HM is not expecting ministry workers.
The Children of the Fallen Soldiers will receive a gift on Christmas Day, the Missionary Christmas will host family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but they will also host a press reception.
The wallet is set at 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are firing from the harness compared to the other wallets.
GKM’s party is held in the House of the Future, from a total of HUF 4,320 000, and some three hundred and fifty of the six hundred ministry employees are expected to attend.
At the ceremony of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas mood, but there will be performers and raffles.
The Christmas of the NFO cost 4,700,000 forints and was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinners.
The rent cost one million forints, and the remaining part was spent on more than 400 guests.
As we know, one of the NFO’s departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by a project management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
For this purpose, the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nház was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt, as we failed to reach the competent authority.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFO, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which hosted the Luca Day Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
They didn't ask for money to use the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister’s greeting, and after dinner it was possible to dance live music.
The question of the [origo] was told: at the ball there was no mandatory evening dress or suit at all.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Government is organizing a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and a celebration for the employees in its own building for 400,000 HUF.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth, on the other hand, is waiting for his colleagues not for a Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
They expect a hundred and eighty guests, who, the press department said, will only receive coffee and popcorn, so the party will be taken out of HUF 350 000.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply dine with his colleagues at the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
Each guest will spend 2500 HUF for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet bet and a cocktail.
Since János Veres has been the minister, every year PM employees have been celebrating the same Christmas.
There will be no party atmosphere, however, the formality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a New Year’s reception on January 20th, while the Ministry’s Christmas will be cancelled.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Városliget, and according to the Ministry, 1000 forints are reserved for 100 guests per person.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary will be official.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial welcome and end with a modest bite.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold a Christmas party at all, [origo] has been told by the relevant press departments.
The price of the office Christmas of the Environmental Ministry could not be stated in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which is held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the National Association of League Trade Unions and Workers’ Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate the strike on Monday.
A protest rally is held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the work ceases.
The action will surely cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Trade Unions will present the details of their Monday strike organised jointly with the National Association of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday's action.
A protest rally is being held on Saturday, and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will cease to work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that, on the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Insurance Act, the date of the start of the strike has not been indicated.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide to continue.
On the basis of the Parliament’s Monday agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening or even at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in the transport sector: the work at the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period of time, and in the morning a part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volan companies, may stop.
At the same time, there will be a semi-track road closure in many parts of the country.
Several trade unions and non-governmental organisations have joined the strike call, and their list is constantly updated on the Liga’s national holiday.
Some organizations signaled a strike for an indefinite period of time, while others declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of M<0xC3><0x81>V and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, although as Christmas holidays approached, more and more people travel by rail.
According to the reports so far, there is a strike at BKV, Budapest Airport from 7 am to 9 am, a four-hour strike is being held by the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Industry Trade Unions, the 2 and 2-8 hours of work are being called upon to be terminated by the Teachers Trade Union and the Teachers Democratic Trade Union.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on a national strike at different times, and the Democratic Trade Union (EDDSZ) of the Health and Social Sector of the SZEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal on health insurance reform and releases a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new way of calculating pensions due next year.
The third is to ensure that early-retirement workers have access to the system even before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers belonging to the League Trade Unions (VDSZSZSZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport for the rail lines, waiting for another offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raises the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement in August of this year, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital.
The company’s “risk warning” stated that the biggest political risk associated with the activities of the Hungarian Guard was that “in the short term, even violent ethnic clashes may arise as the ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations in Hungary escalates”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate on the Roma issue has been handed over to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the gypsy-Hungarian opposite."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring, they say.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have “significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability and democratic development of the country”.
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006 it has gained increasing publicity and momentum as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, and that since the summer of 2007 several organisations called themselves "national self-defence" associations have been established in Hungary.
“The common feature of these compacts is that they define themselves as a non-governmental organisation, while they openly proclaim the preparation of their members, whether armed or not, for defence (catastrophic, defense, law enforcement) tasks, and also for the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state,” they added.
They noted that all this is done in accordance with a method which, on the basis of the political and anti-party opposition of society, seeks to put various political aspirations in civil robes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association are therefore not only intended to avoid legal failures of judicial registration in the case of these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor for neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, Hungarian Guards have been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and some ultranationalist political actors in neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard are the mass Roma riots that erupted in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Poljana).
BNU took advantage of this decision to establish a guard, saying that the organization’s goal was “national self-defense.”
For the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced a “gypsy terror”, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Political Capital.
He added that the initiative triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they say, it is a sign of an increase in the risk of ethnic clashes that some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that they are creating their own guard as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organising their own self-defense, according to the Political Capital Risk Warning.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience anything that might affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It's not all red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays the workday reorganization has become a common practice, from which next year it will be less.
The holiday is not uniform in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and holidays.
Holidays are mostly associated with church holidays and important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year with us: the last day of the Old Year and the first day of the new year are both holidays - the latter just so that the New Year's Evers can relax.
We have a total of 11 red-letter holidays all year round.
National holiday is also the 15th of March and 23th of October, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the foundation of the state, on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
As state, national, or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it became a practice to shift the working day in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that on the preceding Saturdays we will not stay away from work-school.
The exact time of the day immediately before or after the holiday has to be worked out has been regulated by a separate regulation by the Minister of Labour for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, both public employees and those in a public service relationship.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and, as a result of its intended purpose, also operating on holidays.
This year’s work schedule changes only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24th, life in the country almost stops, since experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve are “slowed” by the majority of people, or used for this purpose to save their freedom.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle of the week and at the end of the week, so there will be less workday shifts than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the holiday of work so that employees can stay at home for four days.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day for Friday 2 May.
The second transfer is related to the 23rd October holiday: you will have to work on Saturday, October 18th instead of Friday 24th.
However, the end of the year can be entirely in the spirit of the holiday next year, since from December 24 almost everywhere a nonstop break is held even if the New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scary little things to upset your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send are voicemail messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost no longer notice: they “color” the day-to-day work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or wear gloves and consciously avoid misunderstandings that cause annoyance to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right, or you might call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's an apology.
Before you get an embarrassing apology, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to get unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously striving to avoid that.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching a document, office supplies, or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Do you remember putting your stapler on the table last night, but it was your feet in the morning?
Do you find your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be rightfully angry at you for riding their property.
Don’t pocket your office envelopes, post-it, because it can be unpleasant if you run out of time and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumor that is spreading.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tie your information (presumptions) about the privacy of your colleagues to everyone’s nose.
If one of you shares your innermost secrets with you, do not misuse your trust.
Bury what you hear in yourself, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know what your colleagues are doing.
Are you unintentionally ill?
When you call in the office and you report a sick person with a squatting headache, because you have a bad feeling of well-being, or you feel like you’d rather rest that day; think that your work, your urgent work, your future work should be done by someone else in your place.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t be going to the office the next day, or there might be something you need to stay home for, let your colleagues and boss know that you won’t be missed the next day.
Snoring, whining, phone calls
You're in the middle of the job, but you're getting a rough grip on your colleagues' whining?
Have you been reluctant to listen to a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear?
Don’t bother your colleagues with squatting, singing, talking loudly (which you’re going over their heads), throwing your feet, constantly cursing, loud discontent.
They can all be confusing, even if they don’t go deep into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something isn’t in time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don’t blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Do not refer to the chaos that may prevail in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit if you've made a mistake, and that's the downside of the other one, and get rid of the downside.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your failure.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes when your job allows you.
Don’t be sloppy, respect your colleagues and respect yourself by going to the office in ordinary clothes – if your job requires it, neatly and elegantly!
If you want to do it, you are no longer interesting.
Placing the car in the usual morning traffic.
There is a special melody from the radio: the sound of a violin, which is accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm rolling the volume up.
The music changed pace, and next to the earlier tones the bass arrives, and then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, our domestic music life has not spoiled us with good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic is quite different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and in spite of fashion, the guitar-sealing garage rock, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zszáser started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi's band until, perhaps because two dudes couldn't fit in a csard, he set out on his own.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k season).
The formations initially played in smaller clubs were known by a wider audience when the wan2 magazine listed their first album 2002 as one of the 50 most important domestic albums, and in the company of Zagar Yonderboi, he proclaimed it to the almost sole Hungarian trendformers, which seemed to be marketable even in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band responded as they should: they made a new, better album.
The album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the early years of Pécs.
This was Balázs Zságer, one of his old orchestras.
The airy, flying reference would be on the spot, but besides the aeronauticality of the music, the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the age, has now appeared.
In these songs, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, who currently works with The Puzzle in England, introduced himself in the Millenáris premiere of the album.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and Mr. Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who recently played popular music from the morning until the evening, began smuggling into the ears the great songs of Wings of Love recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?)
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zszáser.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: how much of the layer music you’re playing?
Balázs Zszáser: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of easy music casts; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, unspoken, and just as prepared for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can come from an honest motive.
The host attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, light music has greater traditions.
There not only the ages of sixteen and twenty attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They are much more attentive to the light music changes taking place around them, as it is also considered to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be felt in concerts, where there is already an impact on each other, but this is only due to the inconceivable changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works solo and built his career to the west of us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really go his way, even though sometimes they try to explain it to our music.
We are more team players who trust in the presence of the other music and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us came out of his band and started on another path.
hvg.hu: On the top list of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, Wings of Love was ranked first.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time.
Are you consciously open to a wider audience with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the album.
This song is about more.
We intended it to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to unravel the sound orgy that had been committed on the album so far and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like chorus.
Then came the idea to make this chorus from the good-sounding soloists of our own home music scene.
This is how the six-member choir – Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Németh Juci – was formed, which was then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this the way the song was designed or shaped by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in the instrumental version, and then when the sheet material was assembled, we thought we needed something else for this number.
The chord movement attracted me to get my voice on it.
That night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost spontaneous and frightening at first.
I remember he was very excited at the time, but of course I needed the Diva.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, they sing completely together and they’re not louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their vocals.
They were also on the backstage.
Is that intentional?
B.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely due to technical problems.
But it is conscious that we did not want to share solo roles.
The song is also about forgetting a little about our ego, who came from where he is going, just letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one has the most work done?
Zs.B.: In the music creative process there were actually none, rather pieces heavier than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a race piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything took its place as a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor’s broker risked billions because of a feeling of inferiority
It's unscrupulous.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not talented at all, was more of a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He has a reduced mental ability," he said from his officers who alerted the police.
However, as Le Monde of France reported, Kerviel’s testimony shows that at the end of last year, he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his stores.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he said in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was news that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income customers or customers struggling with repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and he put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profit reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"While I was looking for the first half billion, I didn't know how to report it," Kerviel admits, adding that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that they would not be revealed.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to become interested in his transactions.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought that the fact that I made $1.6 billion to the bank was the only way to reassure them.”
Where did he get the willpower to risk that much?
It gradually reached its position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker-assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“In 2005, I knew in my first conversation that they were looking at me with the wrong eye.
Because of my education, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
Soon after his entry, the first big success came.
Allianz's stock made it available as it raised half a billion euros in the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And it started a lavina - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses said they knew everything, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to shower in mid-January on a weekend.
When he started working on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious of his freedom.
“I’ve only taken four days in the last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance of earning 365 billion
The Czech government’s ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could receive 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroons) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic will be able to obtain about half of the total amount from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive around 125 billion kroons from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to obtain a sum of around 100 billion kroons from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroons, is directed at transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and accounts for 22 percent of the funds available for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed by 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win tools for innovation businesses.
Companies should also obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in the new EU funds.
Nicaragua’s former president has been sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Aleman, the country’s former president, who was sentenced in 2003 to $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroons) for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in a hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return to the lattice is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison administration whether Aleman’s punishment will be allowed to be charged at home or whether he will return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that government funds were regularly transferred to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were actually relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were then made available to the foundation, which was founded to finance Aleman's 2001 election campaign.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This went through last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were not allowed to accept it.
This time there was no drama, unlike a loud debate about the distrust of the government before the vote.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, though the most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All government starts and ends with each chapter and item in the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of government and opposition powers.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
Politicians’ debates are more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the former social-democratic governments have faced three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of these is the high rate of mandatory, so-called client spending law, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which last year were approved by the silent "coalition" of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are the budget deficits of cities and districts.
Many mayors can make money for other investments besides money from taxes, levies and bank loans, often issuing bonds that their city halls have been disproportionately indebted to.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the mass sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks received from the State through privatisations.
They no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for some years, like the rest of the world, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party continues to boast.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries, with one exception such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is, above all, a huge disgrace to previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
There is therefore no need, for example, for huge social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have become enormously large.
Although this year it has been possible to eliminate the part of the pointless populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no near-future lifting of the retirement limit and pension reform, then any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs it, it will only be official.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the majority of the taxes paid by the ruling politicians generally turn into pensions and mechanical distributions of social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the removal of normal expenditure from the payer’s expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not wasted everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we do not want mere officials to become governors, then we must be patient and we must wish rest to the non-strong, well-informed coalition government to prepare further reform laws, so that the state can only give out as much as it can get from taxes and taxes.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of America, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to work together to fight the crisis in the financial markets.
The money market costs more than $100 billion through the stock exchanges.
These exchanges raise interest rates at the bank, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the US Federal Reserve will release $40 billion on the stock exchange, and a further 24 will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the attacks of the eleventh of September, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend to their customers,” said Bernard Baumohl, an advisor to the Economic Outlook Group.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in the United States due to non-repayable loans.
Analysts expect further billions in losses.
“The central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they decided to do so,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensive loans to their clients.
This would reduce demand and drive the American economy into recession with the possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided that they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the interbank supply rate in London, which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
“It will have a similar effect to this further interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting told Reuters news agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps taken by central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the underlying problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Unbelievable Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made it clear that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
“The debate there absolutely lacks structure, it’s just a throw of words, which are a substitute for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President’s book, he stressed that his subject matter is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would also appear in German translation, because, as he said, “I often meet only cartoons of my opinion.”
You can now read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has sufficient grounds for writing such a book.
As an academic able to monitor and evaluate professional dissertations, he has experience in statistics and economics.
At the conclusion of the book, he noted that the climate is constantly changing, that is, changes are normal, and that there is no consensus among all scientists about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so that there is no danger, and the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, unproven opinions find it unacceptable to impose on others, which is perceived as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus had already spoken about a similar subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 were unable to exchange their driving licences.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not change their old driving licence in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to request the exchange so that the authorities can issue the new driving licence in time for the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without a valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the driver’s license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the outbreaks represent a sharp drop in interest in driver's license exchanges, the capital offices were flooded with applications for driver's license exchanges, which increased interest this week.
The Mayor’s Office receives approximately 2,000 customers per day.
You have to be in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers did not replace the driver’s license.
The issuance of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
However, a new driving licence can be applied for with a five-day reduced deadline.
In this case, the driver will have to pay an additional five hundred kroons.
Drivers who are unable to carry out the mandatory driver's license exchange by the end of the year and who are travelling with an invalid driver's license will be subject to a penalty from January.
The guilty person must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police may settle the breach by agreement.
In the event of an administrative breach, the penalty is 2500 kroons.
Based on previous information from the town hall, you can also be fined by someone who does not travel anywhere.
They say you can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry has previously called on the agencies to be tolerant and to impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
Transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said that tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, a driving licence is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an identity card that must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive should give up driving.
It is enough to take him or send him to the appropriate office by post.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can be replaced for another three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the punishment for Berdycchel-affiliated investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, suspected of joining David Berdych's criminal association, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
From this, the Supreme Court of Prague has a definite definitive effect, thus reducing their sentences for one of them to one of them, and for the other two years.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were initially threatened by 14 and 12 years in prison.
There is no appeal against today's decision; the review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first instance judgment.
In other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years.
You can't get more.
In January, the County Court found in particular 19 people guilty of robberies, of which the Supreme Court today discussed 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants dismissed the allegations from the beginning of the investigation by saying that they were a speculative matter.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members, after an agreement with Berdycchi, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered individual robberies and helped the gang avoid being held accountable.
The gang gave up 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
These are primarily robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of the authority of a civil servant and illegal gun control.
Because the police found guns, steel-core bullets, laser control or machine guns illegally during the search.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
In the absence of a single gang of twenty members, the courts have already declared Berdych legally guilty of other robberies and many others.
Further members of Berdych's environment testify before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The trial at first instance has so far escaped Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Bill for the exchange of children: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for injured families, demands 12 million kroons of pain from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital for children exchanged in childbirth, plus court expenses.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Veleba, basically disagrees with the proposal.
“We reject such a claim because it is too much,” Dostál said after today’s trial.
“In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll find out if there's any usable value at all.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should range from 100,000 to 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for the compensation negotiations with experts, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the parents of children suffered various degrees and depth of psychological damage and stress.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even if they encountered such reproach that they did not prevent the replacement of the newborn.
Women are worse at coping with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, he summarized the content with him.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by sisters on December 9 at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> obstetrics.
Last week, the children returned to their blood parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>ermák to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Yaroslava to Trojanova to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina’s district manager Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to make up for their expenses, due to the fault of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ské hospital, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have statutory insurance.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they can request the assistance of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases, a few million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost his kingdom in Valashko
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost his lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Valashsko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although for the first time he used the name of the king of Valachi, the project was developed by a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor, with many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team living in Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Valachi kingdom, everyone remembers the actor-comic.
This opinion is shared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
“Finding the money and figuring out the actions,” he said.
He said the reason for the dispute was money.
“After a few years, they realized that the project was successful and they could win something from it.
They want to get out of our work,” he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name Valach king was first used on Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's television show.
It was crowned in 1993 by Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing the Valachi passports.
The original student prank action turned into a business and lucrative entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of a society of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to indicate his name and signature in passports, and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who occupies the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> had only used the idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in Mayan for his business.
“Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka’s popularity has certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project,” the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who worked intensively on it.
The cooperation of the parties that are now in conflict continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which have resulted in the acquittal of "the forever-elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila took over as the mother queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his associates filed a court action, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> could bring light to the debate for the throne and half the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the date.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
It's supposed to be something like the Slovacko royal march.
The king should be elected for a definite period of time.
"Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also come forward," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot Test: Disappearing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the thread are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production can often be referred to as below average.
But the Peugeot 207, which is already on the market, is significantly better.
And the combo called SW goes a little further, so for me, there's nothing left to think about.
When I tested the Peugeot 207 classic hatchback, for example, I complained in the back seat to the left of the head.
This time the complaint is over, as the body of the Kombi means that in this regard even the two-meter-high giants do not suffer.
F<0xC3><0xBC>rgen in the world
I get through the interior quickly so I don’t repeat myself many times.
This is a relatively good design, where my only objection to the poor console is.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer inventory, if the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the armrests.
The lateral driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
After that, the little space of the head already mentioned disappears in the comb.
Leather case in the trunk
The main thing in this car is the luggage compartment.
This is very accessible (even thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be pulled apart and they can handle heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume a little bit.
This is based on the tables in the base layout of 428 l, which is an average value rather than a competitor.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the product of the next generation of mlada boleslav, we find that Peugeot lags behind a considerable number of 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when placing a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the second row of backrests are down or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested was equipped with a 1.6 l four-cylinder engine with 88 kW power.
And to tell you the truth, this is how the thousand-six hundred should look like, driving the family hatchback.
Quiet, low-consumption and mainly pulling.
If we compare it to <0xC5><0xA0>koda's counterpart, which often acts as if a rag has been filled in its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
The Price Is Sighing
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we have to remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car is still leaving with a four-cylinder foreign engine for 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
The car starts from 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment with an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
But for us, even our head airbags, our automatic climate, our automatic wiper start, the rear windows were also electric remote control.
That means the car costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but calculates the additional equipment of Fabia and you get very similar results.
So there's nothing left but a decision on the brand.
Successful integration of Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local schools.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces many obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and domestic residents have become violent.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
The quarrels between the students and the engagements already characterize the relations of the parents.
The situation was so far advanced that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who used an iron rod to tell a ten-year-old student.
The guilty man defends that the boy insulted him with racist shards.
The police were also required to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly slandered the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop this, he hit us with apples and pears, and then revealed his naked buttocks," the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the locals described the debates on immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases mentioned above suggest that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in Great Britain looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this can be achieved if you choose correctly.
The golden and white coasts, high waves or sea, calm as a fisher.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with cellars offering pizza, ice cream or confectionery cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and even richer list.
However, you can find much more on an island, Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and a cargo hold that the Spaniards robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (primarily a ban on spirits) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower houses were built, and on the wide avenues cars became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar.
The walls of the Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures from stars and politicians of the American show business.
And today?
The wall of the Bodeguita in Havana can also be provided with your signature.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you will be mixed with a cocktail as you wish.
And the cars of the cult of the 1950s still travel in Havana to this day, because the once-exported gulls and your sons in this salty and wet air have long since rotted away.
Although mainly the oldest part of Havana is significantly sloppy, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area as there are.
Other places are becoming more and more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money so much needed, the development of it has received a green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, along the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique gourmet in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renovated for decades, so machines operating there can be seen, whose contemporaries can be seen elsewhere only in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of Cuba's visitors do not avoid the most famous places.
So there is no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remember that the Hemingway estates mentioned above have a museum, and those who love the writer do not have to miss visiting this museum.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the carcase.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their hollows fertile soil has been accumulated, thanks to which the scattered cliffs are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found at a visit to a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad (country)
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish island colonization.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of a not-too-large city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by later French settlers, changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Between the Escambray plain and the sea, Trinidad is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads linking this region to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn’t build anything there, so they didn’t break it down, everyone was glad that there was a roof over their head.
If you have more than an afternoon of time in Trinidad, it is worth seeing the interesting places in the area such as the Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which will wake up after dark, where the music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the way itself.
Both roads from Guantánamo have to overcome high and fragmented mountains, passing through nature, which is hardly affected by human activity.
Thanks to its untouched nature, Cuba’s eastern land language has been included on the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
Here the best chocolate is made, the church has the cross of Columbus (in reality, it was made 100 years after Columbus’s shipping) and the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, there are some tabletops, of which the most famous is the El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of former slaves, can be written a lot about all of this.
In other words, as they say correctly, it is better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans say.
Few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment also affect the course of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not planned, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country, have agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also discuss further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the U.S., with the help of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to engage more this week, Britain considers strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development aid to be a priority.
“The development of Afghanistan can be palpable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to enable the public to start further developing the economy and security themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan rebels has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in Helmand, southern province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern regions.
However, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
They specifically asked for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think hard about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them," <0xC5><0x99>ekl Gates said.
Today, Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary-General of NATO, spoke in a similar spirit.
“I’m not happy with what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been discussions among the participating countries as to whether all of the allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where violence and fighting requirements are at least as high as in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
This week, the Sun British tabloids called German soldiers lazy.
“Afghan Sunspots Revealed: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting,” Sun wrote in a paper with a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt reaches 1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech Republic receives 84,000 kroons of public debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion kroons by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By early December, however, the ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to better development of the state budget.
The government debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion kroons at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, from June it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
The Ministry of Finance has thus verified the government debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic has more than 84,000 kroons of debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
“For now, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, the one trillion crown limit could only be exceeded in 2009.
The next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek, of the iHNed.cz server.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We can cross a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget.
If it were to be proven that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, which could be postponed until 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Growing Debts
The government debt consists of the central government debt, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by cash registers, government loan bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719,4 billion kroons this year.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroons.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroons by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroons from June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt rose by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20%.
“The bad thing is that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows what it will be like to trade when the pension reform is here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
By early December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroons due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which this year is likely to reach 76 billion kroons instead of the supposed 91.3 billion kroons.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kroons, a 10-billion-dollar reserve for pensions, the financing of government loan bonds with 43 billion kroons and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears in a courtroom in Karm<0xC3><0xBA>m for a name given to a plush bear
A court in Karm<0xC5><0xAB>m sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion in Sudan for violating Islam on Thursday evening, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6- to 7-year-old students to name a plush bear as Muhammad, but Islamic religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Karm<0xC3><0xBA>m, was arrested on Sunday in her own apartment. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, she was charged with Islam’s violation and rebellion after the parents of the students complained against her several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6- to 7-year-old students to choose a name for the class’s plush bear.
“The children proposed a total of eight names: Hassan, Abdullah, and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
Twenty out of 23 children voted for the name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the photo of the bear and with the inscription "My name is Mohamed".
The problem lies more in the fact that any representation of the Prophet constitutes a violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who taught at the same school, said she knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious convictions. She said it was just an "innocent mistake": "I'm just sorry that she voted for the name with the children."
Many of the students of the teacher agree with this view. They say that the teacher "does very well with children" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
It should be remembered that Mohammed is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the prophet. (Often this name is given to the first-born child of the family.)
What rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get that name, for example, in a game?
This is obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and final discussion on the future status of the separatist province between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"Unfortunately, the parties have not reached an agreement on status," Wolfgang Ischinger's EU diploma said at a press conference in Vienna.
The US ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue even after the talks.
“There is no need to be afraid of violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult time,” he added, stressing “the existence of obvious tensions.”
Mediation ends on December 10
The last time he visits Serbia and Kosovo on Monday is the mediation troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the United Nations mandated the Troika to be broadcast again in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation mission will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
“Russia was committed and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise,” said Bocan-Harcsenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN control for 8 years, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready for a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council did not decide for her.
Belgrade will continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have failed to reach an agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of the independent province of Kosovo, at the hotel in Baden, where "last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s vision of autonomy would be “a continuation of the past that would be entrenched in killings and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said the compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino-effect" because of the wars of independence in the 1990s in a still unstable region.
“For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
Kosovo’s parliament will have the last word.
“For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“The negotiations took two years.
They have to end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence on behalf of the Albanians is based on the "agreement" with the Western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, at the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to enter into immediate negotiations to settle a 60-year-long dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush has pledged to support them in every possible way to sign the Peace Treaty in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must stop “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, and he reminded the two parties of their commitments to the “peace agenda” adopted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel led by Abbas were aimed at “signing a peace treaty to resolve all pending problems, including central issues.”
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict who lived in the territory of today’s Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the US president, insisted that future negotiations should be "global and in-depth" and touch on all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Then, Olmert, who stepped on the platform, promised that future negotiations would be "transparent and continuous", and he would seek to "end in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the realization of the “vision” of the two states of Palestine and Israel that exist side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
With the support of all Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, whose Annapolis participation was recognized by Washington as a success, initiated a plan to guarantee peace for Israel if it withdraws from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a way of responding to the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with a Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
Prosecutors say the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the gossip contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of an investigation conducted by the National Police’s General Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was patrolled, so it wasn't involved in any action. It was running at 40-50 km/h without sirening," the police said.
The young man without the two helmets was driven "at high speed" by a green, "not included in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
“Because the right-hand rule was not respected, the engine hit the left side of the police car,” says a police officer.
The result of the alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car was torn, the windscreen was torn in the shape of a star, and the bumper fell.
Pontoise’s state prosecutor, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, said in a special announcement yesterday morning that he had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation “for failure to kill and provide assistance for negligence.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interviewed on Sunday night confirmed “the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a strip that was undoubtedly pulled by the footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were collapsing and were moving together for a while until the police car was able to stop them.
The vehicles were seized for technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday by a medical examiner.
What happened immediately after that?
A rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that police officers quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN says cautiously, but excludes that the police would have made “any serious mistake”.
“This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation and increased caution,” the police said.
The Libération met an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your apartment looks exactly at the location.
“My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to revive them,” the witness said.
"There's nothing we can do anymore."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and lame.
The other two tried to revive one of the young people, and the fourth called.”
The tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving police took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
Heart massage was also used, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help young people.
Young people have been helped.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
“They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Growing tension in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations after a state of emergency introduced by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken during the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
More people have been produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers on weekends.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed in order to prevent the gathering.
There were several demonstrations in Multan in the central part of the country and Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the attorneys’ movement has been supported by the huge Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. His leader “invited the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and trash to those who took an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
The Court must declare in the coming days the legality of President Musharraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army to serve as the civilian president has "lost" after the introduction of the state of emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf had to leave the military uniform until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has denied the nationwide rumour that President Musharraf would have been forced to appoint a deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned
This result includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancies at all.
Even today, more than a third (36%) of pregnancies are unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute for Demographics (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalises contraception.
This result includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancies at all.
Ined estimates that 5 to 6% of cases of various birth control methods, such as pills or beespirals, still fail.
However, according to the institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970 only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took birth control pills, but now this rate is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plans to be precise for a few months and, if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season for a child to receive.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform a spectacular repair of the solar panel, which is essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in many ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be carried out away from the housing modules, with the tools "barked" by the astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, you need to take care of your power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to move one of the modules that produced electricity with the help of the 17.5-ton solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to its final location.
The crew then began opening the 76-meter-wide solar panels of the module.
One of the harmonically foldable boards was then damaged by a cable trapped about 1 meter in length.
To avoid further injury, the opening of the board was not continued.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take a control walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their full time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging on a 30-metre robot arm attached to the crane at the station.
He's one of NASA's best "space walkers."
It has a tall, strong, extremely skilful, muscular upper body and a long arm.
A 46-year-old man with a doctor’s degree had to “operation” the “damaged” solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "rails".
In his work, he was assisted by another "spacewalker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts inside, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick fitted with insulation against the hundreds of volts of solar panels, was hatched and "barkled" by the station's astronauts.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his associates to open the board completely, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today, seven of them returned to the Discovery shuttle to begin their return home on Wednesday.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is decreasing
The exchange rate of EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange has fallen sharply after the aircraft and defence equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is likely to cause the aircraft to be delivered later.
The delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, will cost "between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturing company EADS said in a statement.
Due to the emergence of these expenditures, EADS will have to provide new plan numbers for its 2007 operating result next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any further figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating profit decreased by 86%: this was largely due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M aircraft to the French Army in October 2009.
Remains a status quo
The election on Sunday is not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
In this, the Russians show a need for stability, perhaps arbitrary governance, after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a televised message to voters via public service channels, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin will lead the Kremlin support party, the Unified Russia candidate list, which is expected to win a sweeping victory in the elections.
At the reception of the foreign ambassadors yesterday, the President’s behaviour did not reveal anything: it only caused another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violations,” he added.
According to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on voters.
Gennagyy Zjuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, asserts that “there was no such dirty election in Russia even during Yeltsin’s time.”
After the crackdown on last weekend’s protests, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparovo was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer said he could not continue to visit.
“The Russians still think of me as a ‘homo reconciliation’.”
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The first round of the presidential election was announced yesterday, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates can announce their intention to leave by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There is no other offspring on the horizon.
What role has Putin played since March?
Will it be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will win both parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has become a tradition.
“The Russians are still thinking of how ‘homo reconciliation’: they don’t feel they can control their fate,” sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center, said in a statement.
The historian of the University of St. Petersburg goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than in Europe, thus the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people. More than that, because this new kind of paternalism was not associated with intimidation, but with certain economic well-being," says Maria Lipman, a co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "sentencely reject personal responsibility", which quickly became apparent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of Unified Russia are led by 65 governors, who are made up of leaders from 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cserednychenko, 54, says, “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Compressed memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen, Hessen Province, have so far only been researched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have provided unique and name-specific insights for the victims or their descendants of the past.
Eleven states that manage the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to open the archives for researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential Information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives allows historians to conduct research “on the relocation of prisoners, on the inhabitants of camps and on the health of forced labourers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the public disclosure of documents because they contain names and thus confidential information.
This may include the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some of the deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons. The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour on the basis of these lists and to provide evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently working on processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, a part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
"These documents basically contain nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India sign free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indo-European is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath said.
The EU foreign ministers approved last April that the European Commission should initiate negotiations for the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of bilateral trade in Indo-European trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU, according to the figures of the European Commission.
According to Peter Mandelson, “a free trade agreement can have an economic recovery for both parties” and “India could thus increase its presence in a thriving market with 450 million inhabitants.”
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, said the European Commission's President, Mr Barroso, will meet with the European Commission on Friday. The two giants, Europe and Asia will exchange "products worth €47 billion" and "services worth €10 billion" each year, said Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week. However, he regretted the fact that my bilateral trade was not always the case.

Bank of England offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion to the money market over a five-week term
The Bank of England has announced on Thursday that it will pump <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the money market with a base rate of 5.75% and, unlike usual, this time with a five-week maturity.
“We want to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be more secure in planning their liquidity position for this period. Therefore, from 6 December, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered on the international financial market as part of a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank’s announcement, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank’s basic interest rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was "ready to take further measures" in order to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate was above the level of 18 September: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant penalty interest on the amounts pumped into the money market, which has deterred banks from using them.
Rumour has it that many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank (ECB), which could have been obtained with more favourable interest rates and greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday abstained from discussing the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Bureau of the Socialist Party, including, for example, an increase of 50% in the employment allowance, the restoration of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel checks and the restriction of rents.
As the UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles in a 180:115 ratio, the discussions between the ruling party and the opposition were interrupted at times, only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised address on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all of his group's proposals in the context of the amendment of the amending draft financial law, which will be on Parliament's agenda next week.
A new festival is born
There have been many rumours about the new music festival in Philadelphia organized by C3 Presents. However, now the company that organized and promoted the event announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with British producer Melvin Benn and the Festival Republic.
“It’s an honor for us to work with someone who is the launcher of today’s American festival movement,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
The C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is held in the summer, so it will be possible to camp.
The festival takes place between August 8 and 10, in a private area of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he began organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn continued to expand his range by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic brought the Latitude Festival to life in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival’s production, licensing and organization tasks. This festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 co-worker Charlie Jones called Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event" he ever attended, adding that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We’ve chosen the Philadelphia location before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we’ve worked hard to host this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We have been engaged with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization has failed,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were fortunate to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival at another unique venue that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
The C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional talent for festival organizers with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million dollars and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
“The European concept of Melvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating both the rural atmosphere in Europe and the familiar urban feeling in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s population, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favorable enough to allow investment in such an event at a location that hopefully will host the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be of a “heavy” size, with a capacity roughly equal to the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
The group has already received an invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will basically be a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music offerings so that everyone can find what they want in it,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, make up the C3 company, which received the "best independent event organizer" award at the most recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal confronts Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator yourself.
"Sedation" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the Terminator governor?
“We need to be careful, because the film industry decides which is the best place for it.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions, on the basis of which they decide for us,” Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it is the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des tén<0xC3><0xA8>bres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be shown at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be released in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also represented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts' opinion will be shared by the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the end of the normal year.
However, this year it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, in December, the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, forecasts based solely on statistical background are not necessarily correct, and in fact, the current situation is characterised by uncertainty in the market, at least in the short term."
Experts do not support the stock market’s upsurge at the end of the year, although they state that “the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives the opportunity to invest, since there are no guaranteed alternatives, especially the fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the escape from high-quality securities, both in the long and short term.”
For this reason, they believe the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral, non-volatility movement, “especially since the impact of the Fed’s interest rate reduction is unknown at the moment, the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tension is also threatened.”
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees, which means that it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not at all rosy.”
Ibex’s loss is nearly 4% compared to the highest values recorded on November 8, when the index closes at 15.945.7%.
Despite all this, not all experts are so gloomy.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 could close the year even closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets and contributions to the then-normal pension fund.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year as the rally shifts to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitutional Celebration.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to the technical level and that “we are experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on news from the US, in terms of the consequences of the credit crisis.”
The analyst is confident that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at reaching the new Ibex maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that “this time the big securities are on the line.”
The expert would add the two large banks and a few construction companies to the list, “because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, of course, if at all.
“ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow along this path,” he said.
cyclical consumption will be the main driver of the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also do well, although in this area the representation on the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two fall in the December exchange rate.
The rally at the end of the real year was observed in 2003, when the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the rise in the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17 percent, a 6.68 percent jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (at the moment, Ibex has seen an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally could occur.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol opens 200 accounts open from Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This covers a total of 200 accounts located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are exceptionally open from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m. on the evening, and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly said that it plans to extend the opening hours of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is currently negotiating with trade unions that 75% of its accounts will be closed to open in exchange for an afternoon, though not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol will be crucial for the other institutions, as it will be the basis for deciding whether to join the initiative to support more favourable opening times for shops.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol project.
In these places I would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The Bank would like to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the opening hours mentioned above, as this is not a new opening hours but a restructuring of the existing ones.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the drawers, a more modern and colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, who is responsible for commercial banks, points out that there is no need for a major investment in restructuring, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The accounts, in which even SME negotiators will be located, will also sell non-financial products.
Positive Experiences
The initiative has already been implemented by Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol in three Madrid branches.
According to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero, the experience was positive.
In Madrid, branches on Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
These units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero points out.
At the moment, Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica has agreed to sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival, Antena 3, for the first time
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s trusted advisor, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when it turned out that the television broadcaster he led had doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
But one thing overshadowed his joy: “The only thing that hurts is that it’s not because we’ve risen more, but because we’ve fallen less,” he said.
Even so, he stressed that in a weak market we had "less sleep".
Telecinco closed with a 2.54% increase yesterday.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
The company’s 52 percent is Mediaset, 13 percent is Vocento, so its stock market value is EUR 4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg’s data.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday, and since January he has recorded a 40.5% drop, making it half as high as 2.193.46 million yesterday.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can accomplish in the same market, at what cost, and how this will pay off in terms of views.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first television channel to receive more than 1 billion gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, an advisor to Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, a subsidiary of the group’s advertising business.
If the reported fact were realised, the TV channel would increase its revenue from advertising by 3.6 percent compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the financial year 2006.
The net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (i.e. reaching 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors driving Telecinco’s stock market momentum is the high pay out that has so far been kept: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, president, distributed 100% of the company’s returns among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate may change after buying 33% of Endemol with its parent company Mediaset.
“We guarantee you a minimum 50% payout, although we’ve always distributed a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already favoured them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
Analysts say the market is currently characterised by some slack.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its revenue estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated revenue growth in 2008 will decrease from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent, and in 2009 from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena 3’s profits will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.

Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high profitability of the dividend and its long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is considered more advantageous (buying) than Antena 3 (holding) because of its "multiple attractiveness" and business strength.

JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweight because of the "similar risks" (full market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves receipt of MiFID that came into force on November 1
In parallel to the parliamentary process, which was concluded today by a congressional vote approving the Senate amendments, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based, so that both can take effect before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of the representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable normative protection for investors and to regulate the activities of the companies in detail in order to operate effectively in the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive will enable financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also to natural or legal persons, and, in addition to securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, will create a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange players.
In addition, the Act obliges investment service providers to market information on the key aspects of their business profile, their risk-taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the control of CNMV, to keep records of all operations carried out.
The Economic Committee of Congress has introduced a number of amendments. Of these, it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to the high risk they pose to the investor. This has been confirmed by the U.S. High Risk Mortgage Credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has also been used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree defining the professional functions that can be performed exclusively by economists came into force in 1977.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for someone else’s account, does not need the permission of CNMV, and can sell products or acquire customers to multiple investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, taken into account by Eurostat for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with Eurostat’s and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that is comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and therefore may differ from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to have a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government’s vice-presidents and Minister of Economic Affairs, said that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was “temporary” but predicted that the price index would be “relatively high” in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain remained at more or less the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November had “less surprises” than the previous month, when the government had not counted such a big increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%” was acknowledged by the Minister of Economic Affairs in connection with the data released today.
With Northern Rock, Virgin is set to reach 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and are currently only <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (€16 billion, 800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the Bank of England.
At the time, it still had a record amount of deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the government’s promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of British banks’ revenues over the next three years to gain the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the 30 billion goal.
Richard Branson, a prominent businessman known for his advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50 million a year on advertising and marketing to achieve the goal.
Northern Rock highlighted the offer of the Virgin Consortium this week as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption
The Cs<0xC5><0x91>dorség arrested the mayor of the municipality of Totana (Parliament) in the province of Murcia at dawn, as he was suspected of being involved in the city corruption scandal that broke out this week.
A secretary of the City Hall and a police chief of the town were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, a former member of the city council, took over the position of Juan Morales, a member of the People's Party, in May, who, according to the authorities interviewed by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city’s offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer was also investigated as the prime suspect of the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the SER radio broadcaster, Juan Morales’ lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and to serve as President of Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE’s Secretary for Organization, José Blanci, and Bono himself confirmed it at the party’s federal headquarters after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former minister by saying that "we must count on the best" in politics, and Bono is "one of the best".
He added that “probably” the Mancha politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Parliament if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take over as the current President of Parliament, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on 15 November that he had no intention of starting the next election and would rather fight climate change in scientific circles, giving up his political career.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister had been constantly sieged to return to the political scene since he abandoned active politics two years ago.
He also added that, since the electorate is aware of who will be the Vice President of Economic Affairs in the event of the victory of the Socialists, the party would also like to inform them about who will be the President of Parliament.
If Bono really is going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "a place of respect and not of insult or shouting" and more like the home of citizens.
"Unfortunately, at times, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where there is no peaceful conversation, and it has happened that the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, for his "excellent work", but he did not want to mention himself as president, so that his opponents would not consider him to be "superior".
Campaign for Climate Change
Since the climate change movement relentlessly pursues both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he has to put a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero on his side, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and says that "we need to make a new deal with our planet."
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain’s being at the forefront of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why did the Government not seek to avoid it?
In addition, it should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures they intend to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will need to change, what individual and social energy savings will be expected and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have neither received nor will have any explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has brought measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even PSOE’s gas price increase would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
In other words, we must save the earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, empty passwords free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With an agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, does not even adorn the election meetings and gives us tenderness.

Totana Mayor and Police Chief Arrested for Suspected Corruption
The Cs<0xC5><0x91>dorség arrested Mayor José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreot of the Murca province, local police chief, secretary of the City Hall and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources informed today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of industrial sites and apartments.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were converted into a built-in area to allow the Galician Nuaria company to build 4,000 homes after illegally paying the managers a commission at the time of their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation, according to the information provided by the Court of First Instance in Totana.
The first six persons arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, Juan Morales, former mayor of Totana, who is now an independent MP of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as are the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The manager and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A, was arrested in Nigra (Pontevedra), along with the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., the latter company belonging to and through the Nuaria Group.
The investigation is carried out by a group charged with crimes committed at municipal level by the Central Operations Unit of Cs<0xC5><0x91>d<0xC5><0x91>r<0xC5><0x91>ság, whose members carried out eleven searches, in addition to the arrests, mainly in companies related to the arrests, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels built.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square meters in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Autesa e Inomonuar, Coruna in Vigo, Conycase in Venezuela, and Preconiza in direct marketing, and Preconiza in the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (probably at the head of the PISA report on the world’s cultural level), in Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what was published on November 18 at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
In the messages of the killer, a student before graduation, he quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Counsellor Pekka Elo, who is responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory elementary philosophy classes of secondary schools.”

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a violation of the Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a violation and can be punished from six months to one year.
However, if you steal a record worth less than 400 euros in a store, it’s just a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1,000 in a store, theft is already a crime, but your penalty is still not the amount of penalty that can be imposed for downloading online (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the amount of penalty that can be imposed for downloading online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a lower penalty if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass fight, you may receive a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), while a penalty of six months to two years for copying a CD
(Article 270 of the BTK).
According to Section 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's really out of hand.

My GP gave me an article on strange research entitled “Money causes brain activity, especially if others have less of it.”
In other words, employees’ feelings on the pay day depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonances by tomography, and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
Bernd Weber, the author of the study and head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of cash rewards, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why such a great science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste in the mouth, as he is responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian leader Radován Karajic remain on the loose.
Their names are on the list that Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach chose as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet shown in Spain). Like real crime, the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to get the loop around the fugitives.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which means safety for the owner of a car, is a significant expense to the various damages and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, family status, type and nature of use of the car to be insured.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding which car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes to compensate for the fixed insurance premium in the event of a damage event.
The insurance premium is basically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, family status, the type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by the person who represents a higher accident risk.
That’s why women over the age of 25 or women pay less because, according to statistics, they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of use of the car is crucial.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
When determining the insurance premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner needs to look closely to choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in the selection process, in order to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 must account for a number of disadvantages, such as a lack of driving experience and the freshness of the driving licence.
While it is best to be protected against all hazards, there are more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can make full insurance by self-insurance, which will ensure against all hazards, and the price will also be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of the self-financing paid by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-financing,” says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa in Spain.
Another option is extended liability insurance for third parties, when the client provides himself/herself against damage caused to others, but not against damage caused in his/her own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A good advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as this will affect the bonus and reduce the amount you will pay in the future.
The bonuses are called bonuses compared to the basic rates of the insurance company.
The penalty imposed against the base rate is called molasses.
"The amount of bonus and Raspberry depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus amount,” Noguera explains.
Once the age of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a full insurance with your own share.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in each accident, and even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but does not yet have children, it is best to make a full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so in their case the fee payable is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have a complete insurance with a self-exclusion (this can reach 300 euros) or, if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
“They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share of the self,” says Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, full insurance is recommended with a self-exclusion (around 150 euros) or, in the case of a higher bonus, liability insurance can be extended.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a large expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance.
Celtic wants to score points in Milan to get into the eighth round.
Milan and Celtic will measure their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point at the closing of the Champions League. The Italians will be the first to qualify, and the Scots will be the first to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already in the fifth round they have secured progress with a draw with Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but one more is needed to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where on the 13th she will try to advance to the 16th semi-final.
With this, Group D will close sooner than the rest, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be a draw, the two teams will strive to win, as the Italians do not want to stay at home and Celtic will be the first to start from a better position in the eighth round.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure of that, because if there's an equality of points, the Ukrainians will move on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to embarrass the evening of the Scots, who would like to enter the eighth round of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they scored a goal from Kaka in the second round of the 0-0 draw (1-0) in the previous season.
The winner of the "Rossonerik" victory, Shakhtar, would be most pleased, because if he lost Celtic, he would be in the eighth round and remain in the UEFA.
Because Benfica, even though it is currently in last place and has no chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still win the third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, with 20,000 spectators performing for the first time since they split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver, USA, that the band was "in the form of a remem".
Around 20,000 people exchanged tickets to be present at the concert, where they also presented a film about the history of the band, which was a huge success in the 1990s.
At the same time as the band reunited and the tour, a new album was released in Spain by EMI, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Vodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls staged a bracelet from their husband, David Beckham, a British football player.
The athlete was also at GM Place’s crowded auditorium, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
As Victoria Beckham said, “The British football star has not seen our dress yet, so I’m nervous about what he’ll think about the performance.”
"Sporty Spice", was the reason why the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members did not understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said of the band, which broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that over time “things are arranged and we love each other very much”.
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last aired in 1998.
According to CTV news, Virgin Airlines arrived in Vancouver on a separate plane.
There was a group of baby-sitters waiting for them at the airport.
They have seven children in total.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
Their performance will take place in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas exchange between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
The vast majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transited through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always under great notice.
Kiev has said that if Moscow increases the gas price paid by Ukrainians, they will also pay Russia a higher transit cost.
A previous debate between the two countries last year resulted in a reduction in supplies to EU countries.
The most recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is related to the attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom to reach an agreement on the gas price to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to make a 50 % increase compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of a shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
“It is important to argue in line with one of the most important natural gas transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should be linked to our debate on the cost of transits (and transits to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
As a result of the recent significant gas flood between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas tap to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like drop in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will complement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS "must check for foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees should improve the control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was presented by Chief Auditor Robert Black after a foreign-citizen doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, it also pointed out, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the main auditor checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors questioned by the Old Bailey court in October on charges of attempted car bomb attacks in the UK.
In the case of their employees from overseas countries, the NHS committees shall verify the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and their availability with the necessary permits to work in the United Kingdom prior to the start of employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the UK.
The main auditor's report proposed, among other things, that the committees introduce a Code of Conduct for the Criminal Records Office, which facilitates the employer's control processes with different overseas countries.
“Although we found evidence of such checks in the records of staff, they are not regularly carried out,” the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening procedure at a high level, adding: “Our report highlights the areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of personnel of the NHS overseas.”
According to Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, “it is highly improbable” that pre-employment controls would allow us to identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"According to the report, the current pre-employment controls are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the current number of their overseas employees, consisting of doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the main auditor pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that it is a problem for committees to identify employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the guidelines and guidelines for the pre-employment controls of employees of the NHS from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I am delighted that this task has been carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guide on pre-employment controls for the entire staff corps, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published next month.
The Joy Division Tarol at the Film Awards
A biopic of Joy Division’s late singer Ian Curtis, “Control”, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, and Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebbell were co-stars.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the thriller "The Details of a Scandal."
And the Variety Award was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for his portrayal of the British film in the international spotlight.
The awards were awarded as part of a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" shows Curtis' rise within the Joy Division Berkei until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The production of a black-and-white film including "The Killers", David Bowie and "New Order on the Soundtrack" cost only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously become known for producing the album cover of U2's "Joshua Tree", has yet to receive two awards, the best director and the best novice director.
Another award-winner of the ceremony put rock music at the centre; Julien Temple’s film about Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, took the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor Award for portraying David Cronenberg, a London-based thriller, as the mafia boss of "Secret Promises."
Ray Winstone, famous for his roles in the British film industry, was awarded the Richard Harris Award.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes films such as "Scum", "<0xC3><0x89>hkoppon" and "Sexy D<0xC3><0xB6>g", is currently involved in filming "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award for "Camelot" and "Harry Potter"'s 2002 star, Harris.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors,” Winstone added.
“I feel very lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris’ style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time, and I appreciate him very much.”
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people in connection with terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested and planned to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as a series of strikes on church personnel and security forces.
According to state television, the world’s largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles through.
Al-Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, an eight-person cell, led by a foreign resident, is planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
Following an attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, organised by Al Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect its facilities.
According to a report quoted by the Minister of the Interior, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell that is led by a “specialised missile launcher” who illegally crosses the border.
The report also reported that the fighters attempted to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom territory.
Twenty-two of those detained had plans to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government called on church leaders to take tougher action to stop Saudis joining Al Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government.
Al Qaeda fighters regard a large proportion of Saudi Arabia’s ecclesiastical leaders as those who have been involved by the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that govern the government.
The militants of the organization, encouraged by the call of the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, aimed at attacking settlements, government buildings and energy installations with foreign residents.
“The security forces have made huge efforts in the last five months,” a State Department spokesman told state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-strong "media cell" was also captured, with the aim of spreading "Takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violent action against Muslims who have been stigmatized as unfaithful and apostate.
Thirty-two people were also arrested and charged with financial support from militants.
Venus’ climate could provide an insight into the future of the Earth
Scientists said yesterday that Venus could once have provided a pleasant living environment.
Data from a European orbiting spaceship suggest that this planet is more likely to be considered as Earth’s whimsical twin brother than we previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is located a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, Venus could have had very similar living conditions to Earth, and even habitable conditions could have existed.
However, due to the exponentially high greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation, and the lower rotational speed of the planet, Venus embarked on a completely different trajectory of development.
Today, the water evaporates from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and hurricane-force winds and lightning storms destroy it.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a study of the planet over a year, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “Start figuring out why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, despite the fact that the two planets have a similar structure.
“With our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario about the evolution of Venus billions of years ago, when it could have had habitable conditions similar to Earth.
Police seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, reported to have been enriched by uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Wide open doors
Mitt Romney says he's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, Republican candidates in the presidential election agreed to take part in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and passed them on to candidates.
None of the questions asked on Wednesday evening of November 28 proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in a debate on YouTube between the other party.
However, the questions and answers this time well reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known exactly how the production managers of CNN, which co-financed the dispute, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half hour of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' comma paripas.
CNN asked some insecure voters to dial a number if they heard anything flattering: the mediator experienced a great deal of agreement when the candidates spoke hard on the issue of borders.
The most lively and long-standing dispute arose between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who is a forward-thinking frontrunner in the crucial pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him, saying that during his New York mayorship, he was too easy to handle the issue of illegal immigration.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The clash between the two became particularly intense when the questioners were interested in supporting "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as those from Duncan Hunter, California, and Tom Tancredo, Colorado, have been able to get a good deal of attention on the subject.
And although neither of them is considered a candidate for the nomination, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they started to ring the bell of immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, there is broad agreement among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps within the Berkei of Republicans to obliterate or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics were discussed, the debate became very disconcerting.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney argue about whether simulated drowning is considered torture.
Another questioner asked if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this question, Giuliani finally stumbled upon the point that, although he considered the Bible as his favorite book, Jonah and the whale might not have a literal meaning.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who had just won the first place in the Iowa election, who had his victory thanks to his persistent Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but necessary.
When asked whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than he was to run for elections.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's dynamic elevation in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's money-gathering action and the enthusiastic excitement surrounding him in the debate on Wednesday.
The sudden outbreak of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to launch a joint candidate among aspiring members of the more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who shouted in a timely and convincing manner the victory message of the greatness of America, and who found a common voice with both sides of the party.
But now the party is divided, and the consequences are not yet clear.
Labor Party Pains
A new chasm stands in front of Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one does not seem too piquant.
No one has sold his honor, no politician has been shown his hotel bills in Paris, no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the names of others, for more than four years, had made a covert contribution to the Labour Party, which ruled Britain for more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1,3 million), and that the party did not report it, is one of the things Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the prime minister escaped the election, and when, in his statement that polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, he thoughtlessly questioned the British intellectual capacity, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, remarking with increasingly witty remarks, changed from the once feared Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
A misstep to save the bank, Northern Rock, has put regulatory weaknesses and judgement gaps in the crossfire.
The sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to work together against the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an unimaginably high degree of administrative inaccuracy.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals protested against the reduction of the military budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence was part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (formerly an administrative leader), has resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point at which management becomes impossible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their unbelief.
However, once it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is most likely not fit to move things forward, and perhaps he will not remain in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief will end: the civil servant corps will begin to leak out, cabinet ministers will be in briefings, the press will look after bad-mouthed news; and the government will begin to defend itself and be unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, as unlike other political leaders, he is not a "fresh blood".
As much as he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records are linked, for example, to decisions that Brown made during his finance ministry.
And although Blair's missteps, such as the prolonged examination of the relationship between "money nobility" and political party funding, did not directly involve voters, they could rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The gunshots are not as scary as they are described by the cockroaches.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful it may be, can be to create the trends that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has always promised: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed steering.
A good example is political donation.
The garboian insidious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said he did not want to expose his good deed to the public.
Perhaps that is true, but the decision was not within his jurisdiction.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who is knocking at the door of the country’s leaders.
Watt, who, in his own words, knew about Abrahams' actions, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interrogations; just like Jon Medleson, the head of the Workers' Party foundation, who learned about the troubled donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, for the time being, is not led by threads: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled half of his duties.
Although he condemned the offence committed by his party early on, his firmness was diluted by the fact that he had reached a familiar device; by investigating the case, for the sake of security, he commissioned a committee headed by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, the "learning lesson" is not very complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown must take care of other matters, such as the appointment of the president of the independent committee on administrative rules, which has been running without a leader for six months, or the advance of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-hitting Labour Party to cooperate with the Tori and break up with the special financial relations associated with the associations - it would be a hard wall for the party-hungry Brown.
But you have to face a few facts about the party.
According to polls, conservatives currently have a significant advantage; Brown has two years to back up voters; the only way to win is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second market mortgage crisis threatening America’s credit card market?
When blood enters the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is getting weaker, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose as much as $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There was an increase in both the write-down rate of irrecoverable loans and the default rate of late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer finance segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is too early.
The ratio of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is a percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decline in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The modification of the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 has resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency practitioners, but has also caused large losses on the credit card market; a re-increase in the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-down rate) is expected, whether or not the overall conditions for borrowing deteriorate.
The payment rate, which shows the monthly repayment rate of consumers, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor cash flow and not asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
Creditors may benefit from the situation.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage loan, consumers will be less encouraged to repay the loan; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will advance in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden re-price of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to fully revalue the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Chief Financial Officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is more likely.
If declining housing prices and a decline in lending drive America into a recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a harsh future.
It is worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers found themselves guilty of Enron
On Wednesday, he was convicted by the three British bankers who were tried to investigate their role in fraud by former Enron finance director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent of the seven-order fraud allegations that they allegedly collaborated with Fastow on a covert scam in 2000, which they wanted to enrich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted his guilt for a single-order fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division became known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition procedure.
The investigation into Enron's 2001 crash is still pending in the United States.
The first charge against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers named "NatWest Three" are accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare for the scam with Fastow and Michael Kopper, the right hand of Fastow at the time.
Fastow, who is responsible for the countless frauds that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the subsidiary Enron that Greenwich NatWest invested in.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the stake was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would buy a $20 million subsidiary share from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million hit the mark of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The lawsuit claims that bankers have made $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others have made $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his double guilt for his role in Enron's collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and a month in a Texas prison.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States for $1 million in bail per person, where they were staying during the trial.
Enron, the world’s seventh largest American company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover the millions of debt accumulated and the profitable but actually loss-making businesses.
Thousands of jobs have been cut due to the collapse, the market value has fallen by more than $60 billion and pension funds by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year for their involvement in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay ended with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 with a Rolls-Royce engine will begin, taking the route between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
However, this amount is only a small amount for some Russian rich people.
"It has 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“No one orders so many seats because the machines are purchased for private families or business leaders.”
Mr. Firer expected visitors to visit the four-day exclusive Milliomons Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods carriers have rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers will be interested in everything from yachts covered in mahogany to diamond-plated 50 centimetres of cooling grids.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
“It’s a nice car, but it doesn’t look like our products,” he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did at the time of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialists here," said Marshall Goldman, senior scholarship student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabians of the 1970s and the Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the most spectacular contributors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold fever.
At a conference organized by the luxury industry in another Moscow location, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of richest people, there are 53 billion people in Russia with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who can hold a total of $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed personal welfare developments in the former Soviet Union.
(According to the World Bank data, in 2005 the number of people living below the subsistence minimum was 15.8 percent in Russia.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are well-groomed, and men are real treasure troves.”
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were both considered millionaires.
“I’ve looked at the cars and I’m trying to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said young Yumatova, who was grumpy in his custom-made clothes, as if he were already used to this drive.
The fair was organised primarily for the new wealthy, those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to go around after several hours in the market to find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, standard billiard tables, Dubai pl<0xC3><0xBC>ss and apartments.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who has a patriotic view of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft's stand, as opposed to a wall-sized hand-painted blue tile-painted Rembrandt imitation.
“The Russians are more interested in the obvious.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long-standing (according to Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) wealthy Russians have already passed the glaring logos to brands made in limited editions of bagatel that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, filled the place every day to the brig.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil Bed, said he sold two mats, each worth $70,000, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales associate of the A1 Moto, a company dedicated to supplying high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that delivers custom-made solutions, sold three cooling grids to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grids resemble chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which Swarovski said he used crystals to make a roulette wheel look like.
The price of a set of four: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather and a picture of his wife's face in a zirconium cube will not necessarily use these items," Karapetian said.
"He'll be keeping them in his garage, guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many Russian customers are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a big privilege nowadays, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is likely to be a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have created the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were stacked with millions of fake dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit notes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many took photos of themselves with a cell phone as they were spending money in the pockets or just pocketing a few million dollars.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Suspected of surgical malpractice behind a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out the flat-glass window of the restaurant called “Just A Little Healthier” and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod with two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston, a supervisor working at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"I knew someone was dead."
Authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo, who had previously worked as a senior assistant to the head of the Newwark Police Department.
The investigation is currently under way to investigate whether the death was caused by an unlicensed intervention by a cosmetic surgeon working under West Scott Avenue 212 who was not identified by the police.
The authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks’ time, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has affected the high-ranking workers of the Newwark police with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been working as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"It was loyal, hardworking and reliable," McCarthy said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“He was my guardian.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer in Newwark, currently working in the Control Committee for Industrial Products, and left behind two boys, one 14 and one 11 years old, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were working to find out if Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon’s intervention.
"Probability is rising," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November
On the 21st and Arroyo was found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have so far reported very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro had been heard by the detectives.
Participants in the study are investigating whether a part of the house has functioned as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a dried-up rose bush stood in the narrow forecourt and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the cellar, in the car entrance stood a blue tank with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
From hooks to two mountain bike hanging sides.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York police station, Mrs. Arroyo provided her with invaluable help in helping her navigate the unusual and unpoliticized political culture of the new city.
“He always said, ‘You’ll be better off with this and that!’” he recalled.
“He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing.”
Expectations for Fed interest rate cuts lead to a surge in world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic sky rose yesterday after the US Central Bank’s deputy president’s reassuring statements raised hopes that the Fed would seek to ease investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
Stock markets both in London and New York and across Europe have stagnated after Donald Kohn, who declared Fed President Ben Bernanke’s right hand, had to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear purpose to calm markets in the midst of the signs of a resurgence of credit crisis, Kohn stated that the current unrest “partly repulsed the progress made on the market at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
The statements have been interpreted by investors to the effect that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest rate cuts in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements also had a calming effect on Wall Street, which has been reported recently by several bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of American housing sales.
The side effect of financial turmoil was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will release 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce as part of the cost cut to offset losses in the US second-market mortgage sector.
A total of 20 jobs are affected by the above measure, which has a headquarters in London with 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6.306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
The credit market turmoil was renewed after the high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank brought the three-month-long paper back to the European banks at an unprecedented price of 4.7 percent since April 2001.
Following the steady growth of the British interbank interest rate, Libor reached the highest level seen since September, 6.59 percent, with the Bank of England under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to allow additional capital to enter the London money market.
In England, they demand a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who owns the English team's six in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision?
The latter question is topical because David Graveney, the president of the selectors, who temporarily performs this particular task, helps lead coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and because the office of the English managing director Hugh Morris's desk is beginning to fill up with requests for a national or at least one-time job.
One of the two players pulls the shorter one, which does not get the sixth batting position, but, as is known, life, and especially sports, are often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell what makes a person reach the top of their profession, while someone else can’t get past even a lower level. Often it depends more on luck than on talent.
It is not only the cricket that is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question may be raised in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and Tubby Banerjee, two smart, well-educated young leaders, who know the business well, were put before decision-makers, while only one of them had a place for them.
Who can tell which level a cricket player is to go to without throwing him into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data greatly affects the decision, but the options are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain’s eye in the cricket gate at the right moment, and a striker must regularly get a chance to become a big player.
Catching the look of the pickers is much more complicated.
For example, James Anderson has played better than James Anderson in the past season, yet he is a confident team member in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison saying that he is in good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson fought 32 first-class goal knocks and 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only scored 29, but both of them had successful moments at the highest level and hope that they will continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided based on opinions.
This decision can brighten up or break anyone’s career, but it may also have no special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, was the one who stood out and became a decisive test cricketer, who is perhaps still underestimated even today, despite earning double-hundred points against Australians in Australia.
It is likely that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores will, listening to their conservative instincts, vote alongside Shah's greater experience of Bopara's young vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
The bright and successful debut of the 88th Bombay test, which was performed in the areas of the 88th Bombay test, was followed by a 22-year-old Bopara, who was seven years younger than Shah, who also achieved 32 first-class 100s in excellent twisted throws.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah only ran ten runs against West Indies in two quarters in May at home in Lorda, and that Vaughan, who struggled for his re-election in the next game, faced the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have reduced the endurance that was still evident in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex’s universal talent is a joyous and unsurpassed player.
There is nothing to be upset about on the cricket track, but he described his off-track behavior well when at an exhibition he crashed with a four-wheeler of the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
The first thing he did after that was taking Vodafone's (naturally sponsored) phone and calling his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better midfielder with classics. It creates a good pitch angle for its sliding mid-steps, and its punches are confident and skilful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be outstanding if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he would be the one to play this weekend.
Refugees are transported home by bus to work and fight Al Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses to arrive in Baghdad from Syria have been with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or visa expired, or those who hope that the city will be restored to order.
There are also some of them who have returned to fight with the soldiers who have driven them out of their houses.
The mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people, filling dozens of buses from Damascus, arrived.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“I came back today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the militia minister Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently shutting down his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni-populated Amariyah, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from working.
The neighbors of the Amariyan Shia called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-backed troops, Al-Qaeda was forced out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who escaped from a grenade attack at his home in Sleikh, Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had created an anti-Qaida militia in Sleikh and needed my and my sons’ support.
That’s why I came back today,” said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the fact that peace in the capital has strengthened since the American troops entered the country, and armed civilian forces working with the Americans have lured them home.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, with three children, voiced a widespread view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the Syrian government’s visa application to force them to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have fled the country’s death squads.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis in order to move home,” the Sunni retired said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I escaped.”
One of the reasons for the easing of the violence is that the Sunni were driven away from the ski areas, while the skis also left the Sunni inhabited areas. As a result, tensions in many areas decreased.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will resurrect moods, which may even lead to further fighting.
Small Saar region - excellent training
The smallest federal province is a leader in professional training, and its higher education is also international oriented.
Only in one field of training do the islanders struggle with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, I explained to a non-Sarlander fifty times that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan is announced on its posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saarland region, which, according to the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even because of traditions.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6% high.
However, universities and colleges in the Saar region have an above-average attraction for those who want to study in the Saarland region, many of whom do not have high school qualifications.
“In the Saar region, the opportunities for professional training are being exploited,” explains Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an education expert at the German Economic Institute.
More than one fifth of young people are eligible for further education at vocational schools, which means that the Saar region exceeds the federal average by more than seven per cent.
The combination of professional and higher education is also well developed.
The double-study infrastructure is the second-largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite the practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Saarland Region has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign that focuses on engineering.
“We initiated a number of reforms in primary schools after the first Pisa study,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start studying earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, other federal provinces began to copy.
Only future comparative studies will answer whether the student’s performance will continue to improve.
Based on the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk has shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the performance of the Saar region has not improved as much as that of the other federal provinces.
The Bajorans count better.
The greatest vicissitudes of the islanders during the Pisan survey are not taken into account in the knowledge of a foreign language - otherwise they would otherwise be able to harvest laurels in this area,
because the language of neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the islanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, classes will be different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will return the qualifying in the Latin American country within half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chavez became a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, according to a new law, the clocks are rotated four and a half hours back compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Anti-U.S. Chávez argued, among other things, that time zones based on hours were forced into the world by the United States.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia would be cut off due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not be in contact with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," said Chavez, who advocates a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must make an opinion on Sunday in the framework of a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build up its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe, with his decision to "arcul spit" Venezuela, voiced his criticism of Chavez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new cell phone ringing was triggered: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth) - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from Károly János, King of Spain, who at the last Latin American summit was so upset by the constant interrogations of the populist politician in Balolda that he was thus cut to his word.
The German government threatened to cut wages in 2007
A real wage reduction is expected to threaten German workers this year despite a strong economic climate.
Experts supported their pessimistic prediction for a number of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Br<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, in 2007 employees could actually expect less pay than in the previous year.
“The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general sales tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices,” said Gustav Horn, a member of the Macroeconomic and Economic Research Institute.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in connection with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said in a statement to the newspaper Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that, in the current situation, the right and reasonable unemployment insurance should be reduced to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in a difficult position to resort to the alliance for credit or support, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, SPD, was quoted as saying.
It became known on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation rate of 13 years ago.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth's Devil's Twin Brother
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it resembles Earth more than previously assumed: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft discovered lightnings and wind vortexes on its heels, such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have speculated that Venus is lightning.
The European "Venus Express" spacecraft has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell, a fellow at the University of California in Los Angeles, a science magazine called Nature.
According to the famous "high soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there was ever life there, it could have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there is hardly any living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it's still his twin," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar in mass and size to Earth on a completely different evolutionary path.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way specifically to find this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research published in several "Nature" articles proves not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They’re also saying that the similarity of the neighboring planet to the Earth is greater than we first assumed,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, the researchers also discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex on the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second innermost planet of the Solar System is almost the same as that of the Earth, and its diameter of 12,100 kilometres is almost the same as that of the Earth.
The celestial body, also known as the Evening Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own axis: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus’ surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with 92 bar pressure, is barely reminiscent of Earth, scientists are beginning to believe that both planets were created in completely similar conditions.
Both of them had water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus departed into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is bound up in carbon deposits, it forms a large part of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler, the German President of the Republic, calls for the conclusion of the inter-party dispute that broke out around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office of chancellor.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September reception.
German President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s prestige and called for the grand coalition to end the dispute surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not be a divided nation on this issue to the outside world,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) welcomed the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I respect the differences between cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, Merkel defended the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional ‘one China’ policy.
“China is aware of this,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly voiced his displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "literary policy" in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the office of chancellor, severe disturbances occurred in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only recalled the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign ministries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the acceptance of the Tibetan religious leader by European politicians in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that he was trying to break away from China from Tibet and other areas of Tibet, including other provinces today.
Schäuble protects against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against riots similar to those in France.
All efforts must be made to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not lead to street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior demands.
Barricades were on fire, daters were shot with a shotgun at the police: After the severe riots of young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
“We need to make sure that the social explosive does not accumulate in our country and that it does not become violent.
“We need to take this seriously,” he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problem cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already showing up.”
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs such as those in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, in recent nights, young people have been battling serious street fights with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Taking all this into account, the federal government called for a greater level of activity in terms of integration, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish communities in Germany.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of "the dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "higher than average".
Above all, there should be more places for education.
Kolat said, "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We have to be careful."
Young people "should be given the opportunity to have a job and receive education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, during the night, there was complete calm.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, a helicopter patrolled the area with a headlamp.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burning garbage bags and cars.
Since reporting, a security unit of around 1,000 people has taken care of the peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after her visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the riots in the Wilders-Le-Bel area.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
There was a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the State Prosecutor’s Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Cloudwalker in Angela's Empire
The chancellor's action, which has been suffocated by reality, is a testimony that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing is expected of him.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
After the bleak, indifferent and unspeakable action of the Bundestag in its general debate, it must be established that it does not live here - not in the country whose governance is its business.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation with a very strong sentence, saying she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches are.
At the same time, there was no specific interest or empathy in the country’s problems.
But instead, there is Angela the Cloud: a politician who is stuck in a reality, who is fleeing foreign policy, and there is only uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: He is unbridledly commending himself for Heiligendamm’s decisions, but he is listening to how to achieve the country’s climate targets.
In any case, as far as self-gratification is concerned, this degree of modesty would not have been granted two years earlier by the President of the CDU.
Now he's caught up in the fact that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic person who solves problems instead of the word flowers.
However, in the realm of the Cloudmaker Angela, the problems of domestic politics are only incidental.
Child poverty and low income problems?
This is appreciated only for a few half-words.
It is very important in this regard how often a language scandal is committed when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel has to push three times to get a half-legged sentence together.
When it comes to specifics, he's in a foreign territory.
the Roham Division
During the debate between Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favourites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a tough change of punches - and now they have to be afraid of an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced in connection with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of making New York “a haven for illegal immigrants.”
“I would say that his own house has served as a refuge for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani retorts and throws it in the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he had employed undocumented immigrants as a private individual.
As the Republican camp still does not have a uniformly supported favourite, the eight presidential conscripts use the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent’s credit.
Self-motivated 30-second videos submitted by internet users via Youtube are nothing more than short summaries.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain rubs under the nose of his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by a veteran who has visited Vietnam when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called “Waterboarding” as torture, the interrogation method used to simulate the inflame.
However, the fact that the campaign’s important topics are only beyond Iraq and the debates on torture shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room when conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
At the same time, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says, penitently, and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for voting for a miscarriage in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is shaken when he is asked to give his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is running for the first time as a civilian
A day after his withdrawal from the military, he was sworn in as President Musharraf in Pakistan.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a further five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace of Islamic Arabia.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act for the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidential, Ashfaq Kiyan, and thus allowed international pressure to come from the United States.
The former general now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state eight years after his attempt to take power in the form of a military coup without bloodshed.
With the withdrawal of the armed forces as Commander-in-Chief, Musharraf met a basic demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which was announced by Musharraf on November 3.
Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would end the state of emergency shortly after he was sworn in to meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, to which Musharraf had appointed lawyers sympathetic to him at the beginning of November following the announcement of the state of emergency, rejected all objections last week regarding the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured as a result of an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal territory of northern Vaziristan.
According to reports from an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghan border.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
The German supergroup of the 1970s re-emerges: The three members of the Harmonia band re-buried their instruments during a concert in Berlin.
At the time of the reconnection, a cut shot from their age of light, the time of "Live 1974" appears.
At that time they were much more known abroad.
The sensation announced is embodied in the person of the three agreed-upon gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each one has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius has been sitting in a snow-white shirt for 63 years.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, offers an escort with a laptop and a guitar.
From the audience’s point of view, your 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and focuses on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while at the same time it produces a rhythm.
It is sometimes a coincidence that it is a traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the Krautrock music direction that the Harmonia band were playing again.
What we can say here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has fallen through the collective pop memory, but in no case has it left any lasting clues that we will painfully miss this band after 32 years.
But why should the Germans not celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
In particular, what we falsely call Krautrock has always been appreciated in England and America more than in their own country.
When the music industry was awarded the Echo Prize for oeuvre in 2003 to the surviving members of the Cologne Can band, the German pop figures sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When he thanked even the La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! bands in his Red Hot Chili Peppers board, the admiration became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as an old buddy.
Two sides of the same coin are domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The memory is overburdened by Harmony only because the trio existed only for two years, and during that time it had a far smaller effect than was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in a basement under the Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne Theater in Berlin.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company funded by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time the most radical German band at the time, Neu!, gained a reputation as a guitarist.
By 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile at Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rom, they lived as a communicator who escaped from the city.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still struggling as a babysitter.
Their lives are more like an idyllic artist.
It is claimed that the flag of the harmonica Ottenstein dalárda came out of the trash and in this way they found a name for their art.
Some of these were recorded by Harmony.
The album was titled "Musik von Harmonia" and "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band was in financial need.
The collection alone did not guarantee the discovery of itself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Grisesem, in front of a record audience of just 50 people, so someone remembers it.
The effort and occasional practice of Harmony at the time was Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
In 1975, the band announced its disbandment.
Rother ended up with esotericism and kept himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
Griessem's live album is due to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of taking care of the Krautrock as a special German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been excavated in the same way as Roedelius' solo work.
The resurrection of Harmony takes place in the House of Cultures of Berlin.
From public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British ancestor and the manual "Krautrock Sampler" are also present.
He is also the author of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
All of this broadly outlines the impact of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this regard, Harmony fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno’s statement, along with the most unusual voices, floats in the room: “The only true music is the future.”
There are pictures that show the producer with Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The projection of additional black-and-white photographs of equipment with a hollow cable serves as a legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum equipment, with the intention of evading sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments that produce their own enticing sound effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-savvy DIYers.
Not even the housework will change anything.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and kiss and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
Krautrock has always been an English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in the Colleges of Music (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone shouts '68!' here, he's not on the wrong track, and the Harmony doesn't even let him get away with it.
Even the most self-evident thing is thought through on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can upset a person nervously, or it can offer you the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
Through "hunting" and "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden", two films are once again involved in the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or it's too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help with that in Hunting.
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor, Richard Gere, again in the dark back of the Bosnian war.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, as many of the good-boy-nothing roles he played in emotional films for women and a lot of press conferences on Buddhism have taken our time to look at him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most compelling argument in addition to perhaps watching the movie "Hunting".
It offers a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the Simon Hunt military scientist he created was exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so gracious to him: A man who had long left his most beautiful years behind him, but whose decline in his romonic monuments still preserved a significant part of his former attractiveness.
However, the film "hunting" and the German production "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden", which began to be screened this week, will continue, despite this adu, only an endless series of fallen films about the Balkan war.
The film "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden" doesn't have to say much: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from the snipers in Kosovo, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that this time the Serbs are not the sole cause of all evil, the film, which carries the shallowness of television films, is lost too quickly in shooting and eventful scenes.
Cobra carries 11 - instead of a highway with war.
On the other hand, it is precisely in the case of "hunting" that one can exemplify why not even a really good film about the Balkan war has been made.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who are anxious to seek out a Serbian war criminal named “R<0xC3><0xB3>ka” with another director, another screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard’s personal union) could have become a new “Apocalypse Now” at another age.
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups cut him into the forest to accomplish what the army is unable to do – and in both cases, the journey to madness turns out.
One of the reasons for the fall of "hunting" is that it simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be the downtrodden cynic who listens to his heart, as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he also spends a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
"Hunting" is finally slipping when reporters reach what NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not been able to do in five years: They capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Mohammedan Bosnians for a just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to appeal to the International Tribunal for the Hague for a crime against cinema logic.
The aim of the film is profoundly human.
It is intended to expose Karajic and Mladic as still on the loose and to accuse the Americans and the French (which are said to be exceptionally united) of not continuing the persecution intensely enough due to secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar to each other that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this poem, the poet writes of a wooden mask depicting an Asian demon on his desk: “I look at the dull heretic, which tells me how tired it is to be bad.”
Films such as "Hunting" have equally oversized, human-head masks, which show how exhausting it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
They recently reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were a terrible failure.
We can add that there is not a good movie yet about South Africa.
It’s almost always true: If a star wanders through the world’s crisis zones or minefields, it comes out of it with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie and Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
It took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with the movie "Schindler's List."
Some of the films are probably still coming in - because the films about the Vietnam War, which are now classical, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", were not celebrated unanimously as a masterpiece in their time.
But it is possible that nowadays, when all the mass killings come to our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And it deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
After all, “To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” was so good that Lubitsch and Chaplin didn’t know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to place ourselves in the sarcasticly distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re-lexikon" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It depends only on the fact that certain things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticised for resigning the Olympics.
The mayor’s resignation from his bid to host the Summer Olympics in Hamburg sparked intense criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to keep fighting to organize water games.
However, Von Beust strongly warns of reality during the odds.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal "unfavourable for the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has released such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain the momentum of sport policy evenly."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that “starts from modified time coordinates”.
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
“It’s not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, it’s the German Olympic Sports Association,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
Referring to the Sports Association’s decision to submit a tender in Munich for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which was expected in early December.
“To give us this preference means that we won’t have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we’ve been thinking about.”
However, we will not give up the dream forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed its regret over von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early for us to be wasting an opportunity to bury our plans,” said HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at the reception held at the General German College Sports Association’s general meeting.
In fact, the application submitted by the Université von Beust Hamburg in 2015 did not serve as a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg last week as a participating city.
The SPD’s civilian faction charged the Senate with leaving valuable time untapped for housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and did not build a home,” said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD continued to break a spear in favour of an integrated plan for Olympic and later home use for Kleiner Grassbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
At the time, the competition for the 2012 Summer Olympics was very enthusiastic in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Anyone who links the concepts of Sweden and your village to each other is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden put a dark shadow on the list of Warhol's works.
The ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box listed here is mostly fake.
After a few months of questioning the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes, the internal investigation of the Stockholm Moderna Museet has now yielded a sobering result: the six "Brillo Box" copies donated by Pontus Hultén, a former museum director, to Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely to be available on the international market in the field of art.
The prehistory is a confusing chain of long and complicated, artistic and curatorial stunts.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder.
At his 1968 exhibition in Moderna Museet - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo crates made of cardboard were exhibited: these (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo board factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates and simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to manufacture some of the Brillo villages in Sweden, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age now speak of roughly fifteen crates that, at the time, were certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm-type" rightfully entered the history of art and auction.
Some were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred wooden crates were produced and produced in Sweden, which Warhol left for him.
In fact, the 105 crates of Hultén were only produced in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1990 for an exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the main monument manager of Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish private boxes owned by the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: Pressed chipboards were first found and sanded, and white oil paints were then applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard by means of a paint roller, without foundation - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These crates were not authenticated by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition materials."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it would investigate “serious allegations” related to soapboxes.
Since then, however, they have been engulfed in unscrupulous silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Give Up
The rebellion was abandoned in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, the hotel’s chief, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, the hotel was cremated by government-held soldiers who used tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricading themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly solve a wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police charged with guarding the man apparently turned to him and joined the riot.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government-held units have closed the area of the prestigious hotel.
The president called the security office to an extraordinary meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the military's actions.
"They have enough people," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Scout Rangers elite corps, declared that other units of the army wanted to join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
The government has been under threat from corruption for several months.
Manila's financial district was the main venue for the military's attempted riot against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed just 24 hours later, when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of its shares in Versatel telecommunications company.
As the company said on Wednesday, the average price per share is 14.46 Euro.
This represents 20.05 percent of the share capital.
Even before that, there were speculations about taking over.
The possibility of raising the stake in Versatel remains open.
This step will help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Prior to this, on Wednesday, it was assumed that a possible connection would be possible after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network service provider by an additional 5 percent to 15.1%.
The financial institution maintains the stake only as a third party, it is known on the financial market.
The previous day, the United Internet already owned a small 10 percent of Drillisch’s mobile phone company.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17.4 million new shares worth €106,4 million.
Of this, United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for €31.4 million.
In addition, companies have launched a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a spokesman for United-Internet said.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
The two companies were initially satisfied with a good 10% stake in Freenet and did not exercise their right to take over 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all possibilities open, in particular with a view to increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game, which has lasted for months around Freenet and can only be reviewed by case and by case, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and landline access customers.
So far, United Internet and Drillisch held a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
