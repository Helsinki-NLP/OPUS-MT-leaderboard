Members of the Wales Council are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the Council have been puzzled by the proposal to change their title to MWP, a member of the Welsh Parliament.
Kohu began with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Independently of the party’s position, the members of the council are concerned that the change may cause them to be ridiculed.
According to a Labour party representative, the group is concerned that the name "Rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: twp in Welsh means stupidity and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid party representative, the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group views the name change as "open mind", but points out that the word "MWP" is a short word leap from the word "wrong".
In the Welsh language, the w-letter is pronounced in the same way as the English u-letter in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Representative Council, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment needed to amend the name, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the Representative Council is, of course, the members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of the Representative Council as the Welsh Parliament enjoys broad support.
While the Commission favoured Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP as the title of Members of the Representative Council, the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the House apparently propose alternative titles, but a lack of consensus could cause a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose amendments to the law within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other changes to the activities of the Representative Council, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
At the legislative reading, the members of the Council of Representatives may give their final vote on the title they should be invited to use.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve the decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of its northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price to pay for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins watches shut down as Harlem churches live in difficult times
“The elderly people I’ve been talking to say that there was a bar or church in every corner of the street before,” Adams says.
"There's no one now."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "People's interaction has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighborhood, where people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting box."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“Unacceptable more people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will rush the day when these churches will close their doors forever because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby Black Church acquired the building.
St Martins took possession of the black congregation under pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street merchants of Harlem's central shopping street, opposed to the hiring or promotion of these blacks.
When Father Johnson's parishes were planning a reconstruction, they adopted a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell game "the watch of the poor."
An expert who played the tower bell game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "unreserved historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first black musician-played tower clock game, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex boulevard involving architects and contractors hired by lay leaders of the Church and the Episcopal Diocese.
Saskatchewan - a governing body made up of lay leaders in the congregation - wrote to the Diocese in July expressing concern that the Diocese would "try to roll out the costs" to the Saskatchewan, even though the Saskatchewan had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old lobster smelter in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel said he thought he was just excited to catch a lobster, but then realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!”
When he reached the boy, Hammel said he realized that his entire ankle had been torn open.
"I asked everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark that has been attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca’s Ponto Beach to Ecinitas in Swami for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK's beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department stores with expert advice.
This is a major move to the UK beauty sector worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow even though the sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be expanded to other stores next year if they succeed.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury’s beauty product range doubles to 3,000 products including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The Supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transfer of grocery shopping to small one-time shopping in local shops force supermarkets to invent new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company says this has contributed to the sale of food and made acquisitions profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how the profits of supermarket pharmacies should be distributed.
The new strategy follows the acquisition, where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty department to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all your needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to shop.”
Peter Jones "infuriated" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "in rage" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home appliance and home decoration brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this morning program announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business in the last few moments. She now plans to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "raped" at last Tuesday's intensely emotional meeting at Jones's corporate headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new $1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their home appliance and home decoration brand Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and it was stolen from the double Willoughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was obviously Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in awe.
No one believed Tuesday’s events so close to the release.
Marlow’s head office has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.”
This Morning host is one of the most secure stars in the UK, and according to experts, her departure can cause a million losses to the company due to product investments, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention the delay in publishing.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked from M&S’s new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media from his comment, which some would regard as inappropriate for the president, and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be a "news anchor."
“I didn’t give up.”
He pointed out Kim’s interest in meeting again after Trump had fuelled the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear negotiations have been squandered.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the United States as a “responsive reaction” to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“It’s going great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and remnants of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this crowded hall, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesia’s tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency needed for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children forms a travel group in Paulu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although there are tsunami shelters built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The request was likely to lose lives due to a lack of a tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was valid.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lomboki earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia’s past infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and he has invested money in improving roads and railways.
However, the management of the river has been plagued by a financial deficit, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The pressure of the river is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle knives, bow guns and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons. This has resulted in the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge sinks a late level against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat on Saturday after painting for 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before horrifying the shot towards the back.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Eventually, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq to play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much.”
Chelsea led the match in half 1-0 after painting by Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the heel feeder to Mateo Kovacic, before he swirled near the midfield and sputtered to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic played fast wall feed in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a great through feed.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool by shooting the left foot of Alison Becker in the back corner.
Liverpool will meet at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will meet in the UEFA Europa League at Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832 deaths
The Indonesian disaster agency reported an earthquake and tsunami on Sunday to 832 victims.
Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six meters high.
Fragments of collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Please, with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all those near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation."
A female police spokesman has confirmed that a woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has been visited by people who may be familiar with the woman, who have asked about her whereabouts.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victims of the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearing woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
Two afternoons in the isolated area there were two stallions, and outside there was also a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who were in charge of the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymous Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the code 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of the rewriting case of history
The eviction of the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed the cultural and religious relics of England as well as the best of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick’s proposal as “truth” and “to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about removing the statues would make a mark on Oliver Cromwell’s statue outside Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or implement the British Iconoclasm of the Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his predecessor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell expresses the opinions of the 19th century and is a historical proof of a character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than they do now, consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, caused the monarchy.
Whether this is a precise description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation; Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified as a character representing the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance.”
The killer's pig is killing a Chinese farmer.
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near the pig in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig shepherd prepares to vaccinate pigs in the pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the nearby Yunna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a nearby pig was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big scream with a mouth in his blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the death of a 250-pound cattle farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said, “My cousin’s feet were bloody and bruised.”
The surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving to the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked away so that it would not harm others when the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating death compensation.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 kg wedged against this tractor by a Welsh farmer until his wife managed to get the animal away.
After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that, although pigs are usually not aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “killer.”
“They’re just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rain to the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to deteriorate as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. a first-class hurricane, on Sunday morning at five o'clock on the east coast, and it was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
When Rosa arrives in the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins to push deep tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
In the next few days, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large rainy areas to the southwest.
The local rainfall of 25-100 millimetres causes dangerous heavy rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitations of 50-75 millimetres per hour in certain deposition areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain regions in the south-west, and especially Arizona, rain is expected to be as high as 50-100 millimetres.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainy season in the region.
The scattered tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. can see intense fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of large temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa's Des Moines.
The lingering heat of summer will try to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, it is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, at a temperature of +26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can get to +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched a broadcast on six television channels on Tuesday, in which Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, gave their captivating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies halted their broadcast at the last minute, according to which the FBI conducted a week-long investigation into the allegations on the basis of an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that the drunken Kavanaugh was choking him and trying to take off his clothes at high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony in which he said that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company calculated the audience average on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers of other channels that sent the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who watch in offices.
According to some of the proportions, the count corresponds to the number of spectators in the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday’s drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters’ screams escorted him to the elevator on his way to the hearing of the Justice Committee on Friday, which had previously been announced by moderate Republican backing forces to vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed straight how he stood for a minute and a half looking down while the rings flew.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” he said.
Flake said his office had issued an opinion and added that before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the election of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the Democrats in the minority have called for.
Flake became convinced in part by his friend, Democrat Chris Coons, based on his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing it with Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flame had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people critical of her EU plans for politics that threatens Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
Next to May’s interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May’s so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that Britain and the EU impose tariffs on each other, “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims shot: police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person on suspicion of the death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, charged with second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of a mid-term review between Sims and Simpson, in which the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
Police found eyeglasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde in interrogations.
According to Advocate, his guarantee amounted to $350,000.
An East Baton Rouge County coroner published a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Department, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for assisting with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement authorities for their "newness and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that he was “dismayed” and “dismayed” by Wayde’s death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater’s operations accelerated and during the day, 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered.
The centre registers thunder and vibrations several times.
On social media, images were published in which cars were covered by a thin layer of ash in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity from 72 kilometers south-west of the capital after Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists join forces before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona on Saturday, six people were arrested in a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police, and thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
The police arrested a group of masked supporters of independence who threw the police with eggs and powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the normally crowded streets of tourists.
Over the course of the day, more slugs broke out as the police used their butts to restrain the dolls.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no oblivion, no forgiveness", and the latter "let Spain live".
The local press reports that 14 people have been treated for minor injuries during demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in an area of independence one year after the October 1 referendum declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The electorate elected independence by a clear majority, even though the vote was boycotted by those who opposed the low-level separation.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to block voting in polling stations across the region.
On Friday, groups in favour of independence stayed outside to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it had to follow a different route.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives.”
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in place,” he says.
Despite the squeaky but vital victory achieved in last December's regional elections, the momentum of parties in support of Catalonia's independence has declined this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the organisation of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who shot a pro-police demonstration on his phone, says he is arguing on both sides of the political scene.
“The situation is getting tighter all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the last nine years, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for crashing a car into the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 pm British time.
Criminal Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could be shot with a crossbow.
Livingston wins Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
Livingston shocked the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Menga's goal was ultimately enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew was left without the season's first guest win at the Premiership, and next Sunday he will meet the serial director Hearts, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will face the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his loss-free streak for six games in the series. Main coach Holt has not yet lost once after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor suffering from a lack of blade
Holt's team should have been leading long before they scored, after causing Rangers a lot of trouble with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and Alan Lithgow was able to slip into Craig Halkett's bushing with a grounding, but steered the ball past.
The hosts willingly handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
This is how an important goal came about.
The Rangers set up a free kick for Livingston, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, where he was able to move the ball in the middle of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team to hold the defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly could hardly be tried.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt, and Lithgow steered the ball past one more special situation in Livingston.
Livingston's concentration in the penalty area was constantly cleaned up, and two situations required a penalty kick in vain - Halket's battered exchangeman Glenn Middleton and a ball in his hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing to take the lead.
The team’s playing style and crew have not changed much since it got back to the highest level. However, the club must be recognized for the way in which it has strengthened the team after reaching the top level.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous in leading an excellently organized defense, while Mengan kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worthall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
From time to time, the team has performed really well under Gerrard, but it is now far from his standard.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, the middle box on the chart.
Erdogan received a variable reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his trip to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, arguing for security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also brought their voices to bear, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some German Turks greet him as a hero while others slander him as autocratic.
Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died when he hit a car in London.
The accident took place about ten o’clock at the local time in Deptford’s south-west section near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with busy traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash site.
City police say they're trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted. Drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards were injured in high-security prison riots.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 pm on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado special police officers have been brought in to calm down the unrest, with eight prisoners in one prison wing behind them.
The minor facial injuries of the police were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
The prison director was reportedly hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October due to serious unrest in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa puts the threat of heavy rain floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (deserts may benefit)
Rarely do tropical low pressures arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains cross the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfall.
The national weather service has already issued a warning of heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix’s national weather service tweeted that “only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a state of tropical storms or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts rains of 50-100 millimetres. On the Mogollin ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimetres in some places.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the Middle Rocks and the Great Basin, you can actually get 25-50 milliliters, and it can rain up to 100 millimetres in total.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing in a drought-prone area if there is no danger of heavy rain floods.
While flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of severe droughts in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa makes its first landing on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, at which point it is still a hurricane with a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm is losing its power as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm on a Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
“From the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 75-150 millimetres are expected, and up to 250 millimetres is possible,” says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border at a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning hours, from where she continues her journey across Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday.
“The biggest risks associated with rosa or its remains are very heavy rains in the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest Desert,” says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning, 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to a hospital where he was said to be in a “stable” state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in Radstock, Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking to be contacted by anyone who may have video footage of events stored on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Experienced Democratic Party's 'Violence and Anger'
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the “humility and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified to his accusations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
“My vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent mermaids for public service,” he told West Virginia’s support group.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“We’re five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
“I’m not just campaigning, I’m campaigning,” he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats took on the task of “responsibility and prevention.”
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh’s nomination process is expected to be held in the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami are expected to rise
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people had died after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach in the middle of the evening. Many were washed to death as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunami was caused by earthquakes of 7.5 magnitude.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, leaving them as victims,” said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mitigation agency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial images published by the Disaster Relief Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released during the major earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "expansive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and that the damage could be greater than Palus 300 kilometers north of the continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
The communications “are completely broken, and we have not received any information from Dongga,” Nugroho says.
According to a statement issued by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling us that the tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is screaming fiercely for warnings of approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, taking over buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the image.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around the site, please, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Authorities say the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities with transport machines, but those evacuated still need desperately food and other basic equipment.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victim count exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
World Vision’s Donggala personnel have been safe in the city, please, where they have been accommodated in tent-clothing booths in the office’s courtyard. On their way they passed the stage of destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is really bad.
When aid groups began their uncomfortable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start to flow once the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
“This is still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.
When the second night landed, please wake up after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family members of the missing ones entertained the hope that their loved ones’ miraculous trade would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesia hamlet team coach, had coached two missing hamlet players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
Roa Roa Hotel was also trapped in his students, says Mandagi.
“As a senior member of the elite league, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says he has desperately tried to reach out to those who participated in the beach festival, please, on WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel spread among the hamlet community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
“I don’t think the messages were sent,” he said.
The Thieves Take $26,750 in the Addition to the ATM in Newport on the Leve
The thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security worker on Friday morning as he was completing the ATM at Newport on the Leve, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been clearing and replenishing the ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "his back was run by my husband" who stole the money to be delivered.
Witnesses said they saw several people flee the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
People with information about their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been the nickname of 41-year-old West for some time now, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has a religious significance for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
While discussing the album’s name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, “I believe that ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is ‘you’.”
"So I'm you, we, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which only expresses the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly about who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has sometimes removed and restored the hyphen and the big letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was elected president of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, vowed that “no army would ever be used to oppress the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly study grants and opening up more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities is driving young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for AI research
The U.S. should double its funding for AI research as China boosts its operations, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, even though the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plans already last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
“Recruiting the budget for AI research would be a good start, considering that other countries are so behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin's Harcourt publishing house. She works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, one of China's most significant AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States and later served as Microsoft Research’s executive director and Google’s head of operations in China.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers have worked hard to get public aid.
“Academic influencers are not being taken by China, but by big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work with AI.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States intensify its AI efforts.
"I think that those who have completed a PhD in Artificial Intelligence should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
China’s government plans for the next generation of AI development in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing the country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a name change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, considers that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore objected to its membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries reached an agreement on a new nomination, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% threshold to make the result legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in a statement.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the electorate voted.
“I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the change of the name of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The change of name would pave the way for NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and set the chairs in front of the tents that boycotted the referendum in front of the Skopje Parliament.
“We carry NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, as part of the euro-related integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe a large majority will vote in favour of a name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the "yes" sound is "build our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday indicated a 30-43 percent turnout in the referendum, i.e. less than the required turnout.
In a second survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the "yes" option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a pro-Western government after it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero defeated Brighton's defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero scored his goal in 65 minutes and made it look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the chart, an Argentine top player was fed from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green-shirts.
He pushed past one of the defenders and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch inside the penalty zone to give the ball back to the Aguero, which passed the Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that “Aguero has problems with his feet.”
“We said he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the blues an advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful pass through the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back end towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker put the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will meet in the Hoffenheim Champions League block stage on Tuesday at 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a cheerleader in a game against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why forcefully try to get started?
However, Scherzer, who is always one of the race spirits, hopes to take possession of the pitcher in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have a single win difference in the Los Angeles Dodgers Western series.
Rockies scored at least a wild card with a 5-2 win from the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Even if we don’t have a stake, we can get up on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver creates the most demanding competitive setting I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take the challenge?”
Nationals have not yet published their starters for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, playing his 34 matches at the start, and feeding on Sunday with his normal rest.
Washington’s right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season, with an ERA score of 2.53, and has burned the batter’s nest 300 times, with a turn-by-turn score of 220 2/3.
Trump Campaigns in West Virginia
The president implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who also spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“All of our achievements are in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really great -- not just campaigns, but campaigns to the fullest, and that's why I'm going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to the grip of power by any means possible, and you can see their malice and malice.
They do not choose who will be harmed or who will have to be crushed to gain power; that is what they want, power and power, but we do not give it to them.”
He said the Democrats took on the task of “responsibility and prevention.”
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "hateful and mean and evil and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-affected Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, the audience responded with loud booms.
“Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm waiting a little bit - it was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion.
I was not really surprised when the Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am only the last one in a line of Labour representatives who are told that I am not welcome - just because we are expressing our opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way just because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the subject of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, Friday-sized party councils have been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a "more friendly and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is all the more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates divergent opinions, and that every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it fits with the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, with whom I had thought I would share a similar political view, began to look forward to a full translation and statements that I would never have agreed to, otherwise, be it national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a wave of insults on social media calling for my choice to be withdrawn, for the rejection of central politics, and for me to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are, at least, political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day, and never waver.
The normalization of calcification is one of the most disturbing features of contemporary politics.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the electoral rules, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years I have been asked to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything goes well”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of neglect of thatcher’s government uniform school, I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as a city councillor and as a minister.
I have never covered up my political stance, not even in the last election.
No one in the constituency of Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards Brexit, which is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Nottingham East constituency.
Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible in Ayr's block tip
The last two goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undisputedly earned a victory in the entertaining Tennent <0xCC><0x81>s Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team in ten that hasn’t lost a single match.
A brilliant defense and a more successful taking of risks was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
“We’ve been challenged in our matches and we’re still invincible, so I can be happy,” he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson’s goal and Frazier Climo’s successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's leadership with a penalty paint, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which in the conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and was taken out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his leadership with the goal of Stafford McDowall, which in the conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal that the conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for fighting the ballless Climbo, and Macpherson scored a goal after the maul of Ayr, who had left the sideline.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and winged Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game series star starts in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named head of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he co-wrote with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been registered as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun magazine suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow’s thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the landlocked Bolivia is trying to reconnect with the Pacific by judicial means
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
There is a blue flag on the flagpoles of public buildings.
The naval bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smitten with a slogan: "Justifiably, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In inland Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s lost coastline in the bloody 19th century resource war is still strong – as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is at its highest in decades when Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, common spirit and serenity, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Several Bolivians around the country are following the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big squares in hopes that, at the end of decades of discontinuing the debate, Bolivia will take a position that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election next year, will have a lot to play on next Monday's line.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said in a statement at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would hardly change.
The UN institution of Dutch origin has no jurisdiction to extradite the Chilean territories and the ICJ has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is given only six months after the last statements have been made suggests that the case “is not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed rather than contributed to Bolivia’s goals.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity," Zarate said.
Morales’s challenging rhetoric has stifled the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after that.
Neither country has had a second embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the court's decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the issue of shipping as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to connect with the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin’s statement came just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-launching deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was "a distant dream" to believe that continued sanctions and the US's opposition to the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang first took significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is prepared to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up the arsenal that the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security has gained widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large-sized headgear that will soon be on your doorstep
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 collection a selection of special oversized headgear that would dazzle the style circles of the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentina’s most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather liner that covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon, wizard hat and even pineapple decorated with jewellery – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of bizarre masks – just right before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and a mask resembled more of a diving device, and the other one resembled a melted ice cream maker.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of fashion predict that huge scarves are about to appear on the street.
The oversized hats follow strictly the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter-long spool, seen from all Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
An impractical hat, which was seen in social media, was also carved into the fashion shows of another large creation – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange-lined raffia bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a famous stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been boosted by individual and communal success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools SCIS, aim to provide a high level of service to their students and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, graduate and higher education, as well as global citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement customized study content, we have seen the role of languages as a popular and hoped-for subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message will go into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
From this year’s latest results, we can see that languages are at the top of the list in terms of penetration rates among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
Based on the data collected from 74 schools in SCIS, 72 per cent of students who received the best grade A studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Employment Office, 17% of situations where employers had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the future career development of young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future from this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGovi, 75% of over 4,000 adults in the UK are unable to speak a foreign language, and French was the only language with a double-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important for the British in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of SCIS, the Scottish Board of Private Schools
LeBron to debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James to appear in Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he actually plays, remains to be seen.
“It’s going to be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, tweeted that James is likely to play for a few short minutes.
James, who followed the practice, was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games to be played before the Lakers.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any more pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump’s West Virginia Campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will launch a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for the vote to fill the free seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in November.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s Western Virginia Wheeling event starts at 7 pm on the east coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign online as a live stream through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to comment on this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee for justice, who became a result of accusations of intense sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate’s confirmation vote, as much as a week after the FBI investigated the charges.
But the primary goal of the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tough November elections.
Thus, the purpose of these five events next week is to “awaken volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“To control Congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period,” Trump’s campaign’s anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today’s venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican presidential candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in polls.
“From Morrisey’s point of view, it is not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows will to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday’s singles games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon quadruples were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-strengthening power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where is this power of success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we'll take this power of success with a pinch," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 can be played.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little bit of wind in the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and score three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior from brick to green, leading by example.
The grumpy throat sounds of the victory party intensified as his round progressed, as he managed to score the match in a critical putt to equal four, while he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
The pot they won in the 15th match was followed by a similar shout, which gave the impression that he believed that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
“You have to focus really well and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing that these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s special but sweet twin has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't make any bogs on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on a Saturday morning, a Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on a Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this frenzied audience, confirms that they are Sunday’s favourites. And when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, another popular player to ensure Europe’s potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren's paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the fourth game in the morning.
One bogi and two double bogi in the first nine holes dug Spanish and Swedish so deep in the pit that they were nowhere near surviving.
On Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and quadruple play are fascinating to follow from the point of view of close partnership: what kind of advice they give or fail to give and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this quadruple game showed that the US team has the will to fight, even though it is suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 managers before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good command before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they took the top 10-6 of the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-player games.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory with two wins from the rapper Tiger Woods, and scored a high score at four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to keep Hazeltine from losing a victory two years ago, dominated a poorly-played U.S. team in four-ball in the morning, taking the match to the 3-1 position.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12th doubles to maintain the win.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively known as "Molliwood", were the second twin to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball first, they finished Bryson Dechambeau, a super-depressed Woods and a beginner from the United States, even more vigorously from 5 to 4.
Woods, who barely made it through two matches on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-player, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the four-balls in the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the quarterfinals, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything as it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Triple prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the United States with two points on Saturday.
They scored a substantial 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and a 4-3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four-game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point rear-end to a level at the start of the doubles, although on Furyk’s side, the draw is also enough to keep the win.
After two days, the best thing is that Sunday’s counterattack is too much.
North Korea ‘no way’ to disarm itself without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and under these circumstances, there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant benign measures” over the past year, including ending nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning nuclear testing sites and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
“But we haven’t seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, the unilateral disarming of ourselves is not possible.”
While Ri repeated the familiar appeal that Washington would not accept a phased nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every incident, his statement is significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US-Secretary-President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in a statement, Kim said "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first surrenders its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even resisting 'peace declaration'," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself highlighted to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the armistice party were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such an impasse.”
Yet Rin’s tone of voice was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental United States was inevitable after the “bad president” Trump called Kim a suicide-equipped “missile.”
Last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach arms abandonment, but stressed that there is still much work to be done and the sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have proposed that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and unfailing until we prove a complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to halting the financing channels for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met with North Korea at the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress that had been made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterial demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea pledged to close the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in case the United States takes “responsible measures.”
According to Pompeo, Kim means “with the corresponding measures” the security guarantees Trump committed to at a meeting in Singapore, and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course to provide adequate rest guidance
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University will take part in a course designed to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack to the thriving macho culture at the university, where students will spend a long night working with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
Designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the course is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?’
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising,” he said in an interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right unit habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Medicine at Harvard University and Vice President of Health Services at the University, said the university ended up organizing the course after hearing how students suffered from serious sleep deprivation during the study week.
An hour-long course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus gaining information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this has no immediate impact on students’ behavior.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know about these matters in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, night-long study marathons are still a subject of pride, and the increasing pressures of modern technology and students made the sleep deficit a growing problem.
“Getting enough and quality sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state of starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry,” the professor points out.
Raymond So, a Californian 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught for his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave an impetus to the organisation of a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all doctoral students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning and to keep in mind the side effects caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting "blue light" for circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot wins from Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced another loss-making day when Dolly Menga's shot through the disbanded defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox's players were seeking their first win since February 4–1, which was played against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard only experienced his second defeat during his 18-game manager career. Rangers stayed eight points away from the current leader of the league Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers dropped the pace of battle after which the situation was no longer smoothed out.
As a result of the game, the Rangers fell to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and the difference in goals is only Hibernia.
Rangers may also face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the guest’s room hit the head and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the composition with which the team had defeated Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Liv 11 configuration, with which the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy returned when a well-built configuration managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
While the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations to his advantage.
Livingston had the opportunity to score in two minutes, when Menga's first pitch gave Scott Pittman a free ride to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, managed only to shoot wide in the back.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the last third of the game, there was no confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had bumped into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly quickly rejected Lassana Coulibaly's rifle and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn't just because of the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long feed tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly sent the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the exchange, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly's influence on the rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued their long pitches one after the other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense blocked Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow got to his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who became the Rangers' replacement, also demanded a penalty kick after joining Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
The next page of our "Sunday Morning" alias: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the measure is also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado watches" is well suited, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform quite impressive scientists from herdsmen:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigermeter. It's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you place your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really rattling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that carries his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins of multiple cancers
The study has shown promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory in such a way that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of multiple cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer, as well as ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got into the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show did not go according to plan
Kanye West has been buoyed by Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a blatant fashion and announcing that he will run for president in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a scepticism in which Matt Damon denounced Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which relates to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's fast wasn't broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a piece of it to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained that the public had been mistreated for wearing a hat in the back of their heads.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they’ll say I’m marginal,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says you're wearing Superman's cloak because "then you can't dictate what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West’s comments extorted the audience at least twice, and the show’s performers looked embarrassed. One of the people present described the situation as follows: “The whole studio went completely quiet.”
West was selected for the program at short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was a source of confusion for many viewers by presenting the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised his courage on Twitter: “Thank you for your help.”
However, Karen Hunter, who led the discussion program, tweeted that West “is just herself, which is absolutely wonderful.”
“I can, however, decide to be an unsupportive person (by purchasing his music or clothing brand or by supporting his “art”), which I see as supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to “the person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later became an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant firefighter gets charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore area.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belgian court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the throne game, is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-studded hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series The Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the Machosankar stereotype: According to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times’ cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” and questions the means in place to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Harrington, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who is also a member of the Queen’s Star Guard, admits that she has a strong desire to address the subject.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity is arousing strong feelings in me right now,” he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to problems that are now apparent?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be of a certain kind to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
“Young men have something really wrong.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or sequel parts of the Thrones game after the series ends next summer, because, according to his own words, he has “needs for battlefields and horses”.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, a film producer and his robber brother.
The actress recently revealed that getting to know her future wife Rose was the best that the Throne Game has offered her.
“I met my wife on this show, so it kind of gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie starred in Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
According to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan Regional Conference, however, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infections are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator information and accuses employee of spreading "dangerous lies" and "secret theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday that her employee had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles said the allegations were spread by "right-wing" commentators and websites.
"False, lies and more scornful lies," Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the published data are the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person released information from the U.S. Congress during a hearing with the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to Hillin’s newspaper, messages were published from an IP address linked to Waters’s office and by a person belonging to Waters’ staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie,” Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be high-minded.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor’s motives.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during a hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the congressional election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the destructive and dangerous acts committed against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English strikes again – low-power Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already a well-established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that is tilted to Britain, but this does not seem to fit into Johnny English’s agent parody and action comedy series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with the sequel “Johnny English – Newborn”.
Can the language of the nation’s satire made in cheeks become Britain’s new national export success?
Johnny English, a bull-eyed, rubber-eyed and incompetent person, has earned his permission for the second time, and his name tells us first of all that it is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, a secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the melting glamour around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unfortunate musician of one note at the London 2012 opening concert.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious world man who left the chaos behind and was originally portrayed by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades crash on his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson’s physical comedy come out, but humor itself seems under-powered and oddly unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands such as 007 and the Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be directed at children, and I don't think that Johnny English's mind-blowing treatment is as inventive and sharp-sighted as Atkinson's comedy of Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The starting point every year is that the UK is in trouble for the worse.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field as a dismay of an agent in service – which is portrayed as a regrettable minor role-playing performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is already in his ears in the swamp of political displeasure: Emma Thompson does everything in her skin as a parody character Teresa May, but the script does not just provide her with enough space.
When the intelligence service advisors inform him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be called in.
Of course, it’s Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The topic draws on some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English will be praised for an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet his endlessly patient fighting partner, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, in which Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to get her rights.
Thus, the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of his Majesty to face the fateful super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
The Odyssey of English and Bough is instantly transformed into a farce: the two, disguised as waitresses, sets fire to a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in the pursuit of Volta’s luxury yacht. The attempt to get acquainted with Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the authors’ last stoppages go a long way when they come to the final scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still seems to be a bit made for the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same conclusion: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Britain’s Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary will be paid five days a week.
The party is said to require business leaders to pass on the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three days of weekends at the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘suitable’ for the Party’s economic programme and its plans for the expensiveness of politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour Party source tells Sunday Times: "The announcement of the revision of the lineup was announced before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective does not receive indivisible support in the ranks of Labour.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and the party is not considering moving into it.”
The shadow government finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "non-vegetable dictators" and from "exploiters" of non-profit companies.
According to the shadow government’s finance minister’s plans, the current shareholders of water companies would not be able to regain their share in full, as the Labour-led government could carry out “reductions” on the basis of the observed abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create an inclusive ownership fund to transfer 10% of private sector companies’ share capital to employee management. The plan foresees that individual employees would be paid a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on the 60-minute program whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote at least a week to appoint Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court judge, and also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In a 60-minute program on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a chance the FBI could find out what would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a rock.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bombproof decision," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one named him was able to confirm that.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival in New York on Saturday is a music event with a performance map as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty from the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival invites tens of thousands of people to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people active in eradicating poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker or making a call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project’s objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that there is only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert account a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clickivism’ among others – an idea that the world can be changed by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million “acts” made for different goals since 2011.
According to the report, these actions have encouraged policy-makers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the UK committed to “helping children develop to their full potential.” The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country. This was after activists had sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and world citizens just like you, we can shift the history of social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers,” said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions, and the government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the store’s website is: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult, and there will be many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we will be stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host a New York concert this year, featuring artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Department of Home Affairs says the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the navy as a “obstacle”
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington may "if necessary" rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – are an excuse for a new energy market in the region.
"I believe that [Russia]'s reason for the presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open by means of its fleet and, if necessary, by blockade, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the public about an event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is profiled as a "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
“The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another,” he says, describing Russia as “a single trick circus number” whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements date back to a situation where the Trump administration has sought to increase the efficiency of the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing it with much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the pipeline in use, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons behind Washington’s opposition are purely economic, and considers it to be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has given rise to a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, the director of the German Industrial Confederation, said recently after the meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, is going to think carefully about the nomination for the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she “considered carefully” to be a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed he was considering a candidacy at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and correct our faulty government, and that means a woman in the country’s leadership,” he said.
“After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider becoming a presidential candidate.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump as saying, “He’s taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has acted outright in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for this Supreme Court.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren wrote, “I suppose we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s electorate will not support this nomination in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk’s Department of Political Studies and Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
More respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with a 38% stake, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, were also raised in the debates.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has announced that it will formally close its candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Her Son’s War Trauma at Donald Trump Election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can very well identify with other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers carry,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a “stream horse in the living room” and said his son, like other war veterans, “will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will return, wondering whether what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country will be respected.”
According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and gun control.
18 states and the District of Columbia support new asylum policy lawsuits
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to the new policy that has come into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the Federal District have filed a Letter of Friends of Justice on Friday in Washington, D.C., which supports asylum-seekers who violate the line, NBC News reports.
The full name of the agent has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says his partner "and his sons belonging to a violent gang" assaulted him and was denied asylum by the US authorities on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of whom are natives of the United States, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the decision of the Asylum Appeals Board in 2014 that paperless migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
General Prosecutor Karl Racine of the Columbia Federal District said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “does not ignore states, federal and international law for decades.”
“The law of a Member State requires that all applications for asylum be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances specific to the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle,” says the Friends of the Court.
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering the U.S. economy is detrimental to the U.S. economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and “bring the necessary additional labour.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Security is intended for persons fleeing their country of origin for reasons of race, religion, nationality or social class, or persecution or fear caused by political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems—even serious problems—that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts of survivors continue in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting even more serious.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, calming her hot baby at the evacuation center in the ruined city.
“Ambulances bring new bodies from minute to minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered things, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, intense aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how a furious earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We couldn’t save ourselves.
I got stuck in the walls between the ruins, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
“I heard my wife screaming for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “provoking” with “propaganda announcements”
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily that praised the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid annex to the China Daily newspaper Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the 6th November congressional elections.
Trump’s allegations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the US election are a new step in Washington’s expanding campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread trade announcements, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-expanding trade war, in which both sides in turn impose tariffs on their counterparts' exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliation tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-time Governor of Iowa state, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. workforce, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China “is now accelerating its provocations even further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press,” Branstad wrote in an opinion paper published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the esteemed free speech and press traditions of the United States by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In Beijing’s street newsstands, dissenting opinions are only limited, and real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens may not see at all about the alarming development of their economy. This is due to the fact that the media is firmly in the lead of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
Branstad goes on to say that “one of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” an article he wrote, but did not specify what the magazine was about.
Kavanaugh boy expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the Republican tops stand behind and defend Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee for justice, can trigger a reaction, particularly in the mid-term elections with female voters.
The emotions surrounding the case have gone through a lot of rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward in the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” says Grant Reeher of the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, a professor of state studies, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republican, Arizona) last minute's bid for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for MoveOn, a national reform group.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming” in protest at the Senate corridors when the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable,” says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, 18-29-year-olds, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts anticipate a possible reaction if Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford’s testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim to sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, it’s about how Republicans have acted and how they’ve treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, the head of the U.S. group that supports Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony as a small majority leans on the latter.
According to a new opinion poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or absolutely lied about his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
As Flake pushes the case forward, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
In front of the Justice Committee, Ford testified that Kavanaugh had been violently harassed when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed his genitalia at a student party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet counterattack on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt intended to "rule the world".
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his startup company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal data warehouse” (POD).
It can include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is to give the resources, processes and skills needed to bring Solid to everyone’s attention.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of hired developers working with the project and voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website. All of this will be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their consent.”
In an article published in the medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after Inrupt was launched.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest awarded with the Victoria Cross Medal of the Church of England, who has served as a soldier since 100 years have passed.
The bravery medal was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vanni on 29 September 1918 following the attacks on Bellenglis and Leaucourt villages.
However, four days later, the sniper was created without ever learning of the highest honor received by the British Army.
Two of his grandkids were revealing the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, says the event is “influentially symbolic”; the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather’s feat.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line, and "with the greatest valiantness" led to the advance of the troops before attacking the field cannon alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann fell with his own hands to three artillery battery soldiers.
Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s act was “something that I could never achieve, something that evokes respect.”
Michael Vann and his brother, Dr James Vann, put on a wreath after a parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it’s “a great honor to have a part in the parade” and added: “The great crowd of people is remembering the glory of the real hero.”
Friends of the free game were waiting all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Pigsua
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night watching the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the whole event.
The San Jose event had 13 games, six of which were main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show was turned into a great shock to Pipsa Possuu’s viewers.
Some spectators weren’t really happy to watch the game all night long.
A friend of the free game opened up on Twitter describing replacing the game with a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate to be presented at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the timetables will be worked out to allow UK viewers to follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
“It’s six o’clock in the morning, and we can’t do the show until Sunday for our time, which is Monday for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, messages started to go in the direction and in the other direction, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
That was not the case, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, a swimmer and Olympic athlete, says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says she only noticed when she went to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 by Lauren Laverne, Daley said she was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also tells us that after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a long-time radio host, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne’s first show, Daley said she felt younger than everyone else because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work.”
He says: “To this day these feelings, feeling less and different, have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed.”
He says he wants to show that he is ‘something’ so that he doesn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality is finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he will perform at this year’s Commonwealth Games, appealing to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his love for the man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “became a surprise.”
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things so young,” she attended her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced the same hardships and hardships,” Daley says.
The couple got a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal,” he says.
“You know, there are bigger things than a gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest things he asked Daley about was the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't gonna be there to be in the front row anymore," Daley said.
"I held him by the hand when his breathing stopped. It wasn't until he had really stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't vulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was something I’d dreamed of my whole life – jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first choice of songs on the broadcast – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which aroused feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gives his skin to chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Pick-up for Mickelson exchange bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to cheat a lot in order to avoid a record round in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in a two-year event, went on a record 12th shift by Captain Jim Furyk for fourball and foursome on Saturday.
In general, a five-time Major tournament winner focused on attention spent half of the day as a cheerleader and half of the day on the field trying to gain control of his beat.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field where a long-grown grunt punishes for inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, the 9th Sunday game will be played by British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, with the aim of pitching a tube of all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they hit 12 doubles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game may prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role in which he played today. He clapped me in the back, shook me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went and we came up with a solution like this.
He wants to be on the field as much as anyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for several Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyki says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at the expense of people, and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes,” he explains.
"Younger players must have had fun with him this week, and it's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stakes in the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a leadership position can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s vast leadership position before the last day’s duel can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win with a lime line just by the size of his nose and win with the narrowest margin possible141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds itself of how we were leading the way in Valderra, we were leading the way in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderra, albeit a little,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team’s 5–3 wins on both Friday and yesterday, moving to 10–6 at Le Golf National.
History will prove to me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big calibre.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we are only aiming for it.
As I’ve always said, I’m going to focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Surprised by how his team’s players have made it through a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I’ll never lick until I drop in on such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, priority will be given to individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when the field is alone, the player’s capacity is tested to the ground.
This is a message that must be conveyed to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to get the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who will also get him to go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the opposing team, Jim Furyk, will demand better performance from his players as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced full-time translations of the last day in both directions, being part of the team that won Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won the "Museum of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team stretched the lines of his team to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our teams accordingly and put the boys on the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a defensive battle and meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to meet their European opponents.
“I put the group’s friends in this order because I think it’s going through the whole tournament,” Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest frigate of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace obsolete equipment during the Cold War, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosive costs, local media say.
According to a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit, the launch of ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class, has been postponed for the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with an effective cannon, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, as well as with anti-slip technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal detection.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without ever visiting the port of residence.
However, persistent delays mean that warships at the cutting edge of technology, which are said to be designed to improve Germany’s influence in the overseas territories, are already out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The flawed F125 frigate ended up in headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to deploy the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the vessel after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have spoken of material "software and equipment failures" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the crew of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to upgrade later.
With a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as Germany's ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag of the whole project is also becoming a problem.
The price is estimated to have risen to a staggering amount of EUR 3.1 billion, while the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of introducing new frigates have emerged as the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, said earlier this year that the fleet’s usable ships “are running low.”
According to the authorities, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been delivered.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could be deployed.
The environmental organization is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide them in future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, monitors parasites and dwarves, as well as earbuds and water traps in the Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed in important locations in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The employees and volunteers of the organisation also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species that are involved in each case are ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report will be created, in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture based on the size of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how different species use them.
Knowledge helps in the planning of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of the bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to the night-time hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching catches than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organisation dedicated to the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take rest seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, check resting places and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat protection area for the Dumfries and the Three Manors in the Galloway area, with eight of Scotland’s ten bat oils.
According to David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to succeed.”
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for bats before taking up refurbishment work, since the destruction of one bat resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the bat protection organisation, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described rape allegations against him as “false news” and says people want to “advertise themselves” by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action on allegations of suing the German magazine Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid the victim $375,000 for a cover-up, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for 142 million followers only hours after the allegations were made. A 33-year-old footballer sharply rejected the allegations and described them as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for allegations they have called “unusable reporting of privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for “spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the violation, which probably means the most serious personal rights violation in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into a player’s room where he allegedly raped him, according to papers delivered to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent good” but “one percent” disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a settlement because he was “abhorred by the possibility of revenge” and worried that he would “be subjected to public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to an agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overrun from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' car manufacturing
The UK would “forever regret” if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considers the announcement by Toyota’s UK unit to temporarily suspend production in its factory near Derby in Burnaston if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be seen as job losses if Brexit ends without a deal.
The plant in Burnaston, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our factory,” says Marvin Cooke, President and CEO of Toyota’s Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union in terms of how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month when Brexit takes place.
The most important concern is the risk associated with the supply chain, according to car manufacturers, when a non-contracted Brexit occurs.
The Toyota production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars are manufactured on request.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to Toyota, it is impossible to keep a stock at the Derbyshire factory for more than 24 hours, and production would have to be stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's EU-relationship plan is "fully calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal; we want the best possible deal, which not only means success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but also those of other manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far."
Toyota can’t tell you how long production will be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union agent at the factory, says concern is growing among members: “In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
The government spokesman says: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be “must be postponed another week” around Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh due to a blatant duty,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s involvement in the election, Trump’s assistants’ contacts with Russia, and the president’s possible actions to prevent justice.
In Washington, it has been rumored for months that Trump intends to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller’s investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to announce Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so Thursday was announced as the date of the meeting.
Trump said he "preferably" fired Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations, which further delayed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press chief, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News' Sunday program.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, Sanders said: “The date for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court right now.
But I always want to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than aversion to the “obviousness” of TV journalists, but said: “I do not dispute the fact that they are attention-seeking.”
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president keeps more Question Hours than any president before him,” he says, adding more evidence without quoting: “We’ve checked those numbers.”
“The press conferences will still be held,” Sanders said, but “it’s infinitely much better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss them with me.
We often try to do this, and you have seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this when he appeared uninhibitedly and from time to time strangely gathered journalists.
Health Minister wrote a letter to workers from the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) about fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to workers in the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter while the UK's withdrawal from the EU is less than six months away.
The Scottish Government has already been prepared to cover the costs of applications from EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal separation.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of Tennessee State Tigers, has been in an emergency surgery since losing to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the incident happened just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it,” Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before putting him on a pair and taking him aside for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State's attorney told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/extent of the injury at this stage", and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and will play for the first time in the team after moving from Illinois.
He had five matches on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The amendment aims to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today about the higher tax rates charged by foreign buyers when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters, and Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of the good-earned.
The increase in stamp duty is directed at people and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this is channelled into government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the increases in the number of second dwellings and dwellings – can be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 % of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, increasing prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘a ghost city’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for cheap housing in order to remedy Britain's "hospital situation".
Corbyn has published an eye-catching series of proposals to modernise the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of "confidential evictions".
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new homes.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to dedicate my Prime Minister’s term to the restoration of the British dream – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, having a home has become a far-fetched dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team.”
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s leader, says his “his ultimate goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge to bring the team back to their home in the northeast, and is currently in third place in the British Division 2.
Ross moved to the "Lights Stadium" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play in my country’s team.
I got into the second team and it was there,” Ross says in a BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
“As a child, I often watched Scottish games at Hampden with my father, and that’s something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will come only if I succeed as a manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering the shoes of his famous predecessors in a prominent company, which he has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“At the moment, I am measuring my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and capabilities of the club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably think I’d be successful only if I could pilot the team back into the Premier League.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching group.
He then helped Alloa rise from the falling games of the third series and raised St Mirren from the falling state to the champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career as a player in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was probably at a real crossroads with my career,” he recalls the time when he moved to the head of Alloa.
“I truly believed I was more suited to being a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, made quite a lot of money and got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but running a team feels like the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for myself, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The entire interview will be listened to at Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the sequin is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., research shows
The heat wave of the summer has given a kick to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time it has accumulated more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the income of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the football world championships meant that July turned out to be June-like with a 2.8 percent increase in pub sales, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The decline of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful, and their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out drinking in their mind.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food were down by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hotel restaurant consulting company, says: “The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors influencing the sale of the non-household meal market.
It is no surprise that the competition for restaurant chains continues, although the decrease in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly acute now that the industry is struggling with the cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to the worst of the operators focused on the food, and only time will show if the lower temperatures in August will bring the industry’s desperately needed rest of the breath.
The combined total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children – some even 11 years old – are hiding social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study says.
A study of 20,000 high school pupils revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
News has raised concerns that accounts can share sexual content
20 percent of students say they have a ‘head account’ that is shown to parents
A fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the fast-growing existence of ‘Instagram Fake Accounts’, referring to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has increased fears that accounts can publish sexually explicit content.
20 percent of students said they thought they had cleaned up a ‘head account’ for parents to show while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped to be raped after crashing into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle's "Voice of Athletes" to Scottish Athletes' Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Board of Athletes and participates in the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete. The Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the term as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the athlete’s extensive, international experience accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is greatly respected amongst athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit immensely from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, “I look forward to my role as a mouthpiece for athletes and hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction.”
Four Olympic gold medal winners, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now a regular BBC commentator, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient cerebral circulatory disorder.
He tweeted, “A month ago, I had a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if and when I will recover.
This has been an exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training with agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
An ad that equates mothers with cows shares opinions online
The ad, which equates breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump" to boost its marketing with a face-to-face and music video-style ad that describes the freedom that a new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a barn filled with hay, among other things, in the words of the song: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not udders, they're tits."
The saying goes, “Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my kites.”
However, an advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused a discussion online.
The video, which has collected 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has triggered a conflicting reaction from viewers, many say that it is ruining the dairy industry’s daily ‘fears’.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after giving birth,” one commentator wrote.

Another viewer commented: "It is understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
The third commenter added: "A perfectly reality-obsessed advertisement."
The ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "sorry".
“I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product,” he wrote in one of his comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘know themselves as cows’.
It is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and discreetly fits inside the breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and artistic director at Mother’s advertising agency, commented on the rumour: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry to the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the feeling of incredible freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and recognisable way.”
The Elvie pump has reached the headlines before.

Hundreds of migrant children transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
Despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, this is partly due to the fact that, as a result of the rough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, the placement of children in foster families has become more difficult.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of paperless immigrants, and enrolling as a foster family can jeopardize their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster homes for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
Almost 80% of the people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people,” Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with cases of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with before the court within one month of the time limit of 60 days previously in use, the staff of the reception centre will report.
Many prefer to appear through videoconferencing rather than in person when they refer their case to the immigration court.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be promptly expelled.
According to the reports published by the reception centre staff and the system in recent months, the time spent in custody affects whether children start suffering from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s despair may go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is already at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the prime minister’s deputy, said that foreign forces are illegally in the country, using the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be dealt with accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the “holy fight until all Syria is cleared” of both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign forces.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops deployed in Syria, where they are mainly trained and guided by the Kurds and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops to tear the country apart.
With regard to the refugee crisis, Moualem said the conditions were good for the return and accused “some Westerners” of spreading “irrational fears” that encouraged refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have called on the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the territory of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian troops.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would be directed at jihadists, including al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra front fighters, "who will be exterminated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to soon convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a coup and a scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the number of best viewing times has more than doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled with MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewing time of 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top of 3.5 million viewers on major news events.
“This is the grass that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor program, of a minister who rises to president after the attack destroyed the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade story goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the global economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of the panel of experts who are debating the use of Bob Woodward’s source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 strutsin leather pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, “a garment of arrogance”) and the consequences of unscrupulous descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I can never watch Super Mario the same way I used to.
“What he’s doing feels like a reality TV show, because in part it’s about giving something to the public every night,” says Wheelhouse Entertainment Director and Pantilainaamo creator Brent Montgomery of the changing personalities of Trump’s show and the daily shifting plot twists (NFL dispute, Kim Jong Un’s praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a lovely sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, which was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Money flows from the outside for tight midterm shooting
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has been faced with a real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the congressional districts, two candidates who have already been elected will have to fight in one place.
This newly re-restricted Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in the second constituency last spring's special election.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district division was unconstitutional in favour of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has sparked economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District Special Elections, which were widely followed.
The place had been in the Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have made a great advance for Democrats.
U.S. plans to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdraws from its plans
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the slight reaction of Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “on the basis of a slow line that Taiwan is no longer recognized,” said department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed the high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to proceed and this effectively ended speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a signal to the meeting scheduled for mid-October about the importance that the administration gives to the meeting, diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokeswoman at Bolton refused to comment on the details of a conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the regime, who also spoke under the protection of the condition of anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be investigating whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and may be condemned by his peers.
There are a lot of whispers here, and I am not saying that the defeat of President Trump would be inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the ensuing massacre of many years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been polished since it became known to the public that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the possible inability of the President to perform his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavangh’s actions is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail at these dawns, our democracy will have a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, emigrated to America as an immigrant, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by the chipper.
How could this legacy be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist for Rapid Wien
The Rangers will meet at their home in Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the G-block of the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the field this season before Villarreal 2-2, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer,” the 31-year-old player says.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to win at the end of the win, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got to the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important night in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this set, we will be able to give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training runs well.
I hope that we can now press fully, leave the past season behind us and succeed.”
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep at night
Although the participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they would discuss the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost determinant.
Take financial advice with you to the discussion: advice can also help you figure out a way to cover these costs.
Financing options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-funded insurance, if you can afford it.
Create legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your invoices will be paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just for financial reasons. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.

The victim's injuries are not life threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Please in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
As the communications to the area have been cut off, the rescue authorities have not received any information, please, from the north of the Donggala municipality area, which is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake surface centre.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palusta and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawes, located at a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastal line of the northwestern part of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is a provincial administrative area with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the central province of Sulawes, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala, are fisheries and agriculture.
The mining of nickel is also important, but it is concentrated on the opposite coast of the Morowal Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palulu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in an active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's most populated island, Java, south, causing a tsunami that hit the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude quake hit Padang city, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of Sumatra's Mentawa islands, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A surface quake hit Aceh's Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of execution.
According to the Alaskan police’s Saturday report, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence and for preventing and opposing domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone call from a female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Prison, and the guarantee amount has been set at $500, according to TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "really innocent".
Palin is charged with three class A offences, which means that he may receive a maximum sentence of imprisonment of one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which can be sentenced to a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For the first time, Palin has not been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the execution.
The case is currently under trial in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of slapping him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for associating her son’s violent behavior with traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
With a magnitude of 7.5, the earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes to the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social media, videos are circulating at the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festivals Please in town when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the indictment, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot’s rental car in a October attack on the West Side Highway, south of Manhattan, where he drove on foot and on cyclists.
According to the New York Southern District death penalty application, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and caused “intentionally” serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, federal law imposed a 22-point indictment on Saipovi, which included an indictment of eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal code in cases of organised crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack called for "remarkable planning and preparation", prosecutors noted and described the way in which Saipov made his actions "detestable, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the death penalty was handed down by the South District Court of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in the federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators what he did felt good, the police said.
Saipov said the authorities were inspired to watch ISIS videos on their phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He replied to the 22-point indictment that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipovi’s federal public defense attorneys, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of being released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma of those involved in these events,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked him not to be charged with the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in Brexit negotiations.
Today, Nigel Farage vowed in a protest against conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
Former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Euroscepticism - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative line representative Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that Britain would "be out already" if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May confronts the gap between his deeply divided lines in the settlement of the challenge underlined by the left-wing conservatives involved in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of the pressure of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to “put the Chequers proposal away.”
He proposed that Farage should be involved and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but the Chequers proposal needs to be removed."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not wage world wars to end up in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone thwarted the idea that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely wrong proposition.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, and neither the party members nor the activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians need to feel pressured if they plan to reverse the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to water down Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t approve of it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to roll over Brexit to feel pressure from you.”
"We are going to mobilize an army of citizens of this country who gave us a victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
In the meantime, supporters of staying march through Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
The Labour Party’s Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for the security problems they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the people who say they are getting IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus, and the frictionless border operations for free Irish trade,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering presidential nomination.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering a presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the City Hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, faces Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign in November.
Warren is expected to stand up to Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th city hall meeting with voters after the beginning of Trump’s season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest position."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting case
Louisiana's Baton Rouge police said Saturday they arrested a person suspected of shooting down Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
Police had released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the scene.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present at the interrogations, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was taken to East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games and 10 starters last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the Mercedes team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost alone in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the shelter first and left Hamilton to drive a group of tails, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes was ambushed later in the race and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton moved past a little contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up his position after two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started with a rear row and was seventh after the first round.
Afterwards, he was in charge of much of the race to prolong the change of tyres as he aimed for a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen.
He eventually came to the fort in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps when Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job, reaching a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of "the nakedness, the viciousness and the dishonesty of the people".
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest,” he said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you have years of this information?
Do you remember his answer... do you have a document - 'Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
"We didn't leak," he added, sneezing at the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's Kavanaugh allegations and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes.”
But his ban did not suit the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday’s occasion: “Let me tell you that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suspected Democrats of using the allegations for their own benefit.
“They have decided to regain power by any means possible.
You see that evil and evil, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the defeat of Friday's Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants held a leading position in the early stages thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwyer re-established Giants' lead position.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefen's men, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's feed. David Rutherford fed when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the Cownie handicap goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead position for the first set break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first set.
The home team assembled their line and Bouchard again leveled the superiority at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen managed to make Dundee the first lead goal at the end of the second round, and he also secured victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be at their next home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The pilot died in making sure that hundreds of passengers on board escaped an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death, making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and several have been missing after a severe earthquake and the tsunami caused by it hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area, and many people have fallen into the trap of material that has fallen into the trap.
Although colleagues escaped with their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in a wildly wavy air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stood still and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely released into the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
A helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of victims will increase to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have announced that links to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are in short supply.
"The victim population is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Even the waves that have grown to six metres have destroyed Please, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo machines bring help and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old housewife, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what is waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it can turn out to be even worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Paulu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
“You ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
Representatives of an airline that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, although the previous report states that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from a safely sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the lost passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some of the Witnesses thought the plane ran over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane to emergency exits in waistwater.
He told the crew that he had panicked and shouted, and that he himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen working on a nearby dock were involved in rescue work by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the plane sank about 30 meters (a hundred feet) into deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial in which he was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his cell phone to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the time of the victim’s death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks after he died.
Based on the data recorded on the mobile phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The final speeches of the defence are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol band The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from the original, with messages related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?
New York nanny sues couple for racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother of the child complaining that she is “again one black person.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with “cruciating.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived to work on her first day of work in 2016 and she was told that she was dark.
“EIIIII, back to the dark,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who realized his mistake, had fired Maurice, stating that his former African-American nanny, who had received their departure passports, had done his job poorly and had this time been waiting for the Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one day at work and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and wants $350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally hired to live and work in a family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist allegations, saying that ending Maurice's employment relationship was a well-founded solution because they couldn't trust her when she was offended.
“My wife sent him something he wasn’t meant to say.
He's not a racist.
"We're not racists," Joel Plasco said in an interview with Posti.
"But would you leave your child to the person you've been unkind to, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
“Are we going to start chasing someone in this situation?
“It’s not very nice,” the banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, depriving them of their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that the public would not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: “It’s hard to live up to the position of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now that Paddington’s huge popularity is known.”
Prove that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children’s books about the adventures of the toy bear, had been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington was described as a “very important family member” and said his father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and not a sloppy guy at all,” the daughter said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s achievement for him; something you are proud of, even though it’s not really your own accomplishment.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter was praised for her plane landing at Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“They called a lot of times and told me it was really bad that he was not expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then they called and said that my daughter would die in a matter of minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that kept his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it all went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about the test he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I kept my head down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Dead Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicides on the Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son, Tyler, was diagnosed with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious sneeze.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would light up the whole room.”
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was down or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened their gifts, he did not take any eye contact with them or anything like that.”
He notes that Mark’s death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to survive: “It breaks the family apart.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to keep on living and keep on fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped - a time-limited and limited investigation - we could perhaps achieve some unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "destroy" the deadlock caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court of the country will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to encourage them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush’s time and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow across the game and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors drops during Kimi
South Korean lawmaker says the number of people who have emigrated to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification and reported that the leaps occurred last year in 1,127 - in 2011 they occurred in 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the price increases for traffickers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of North Korea’s lizards will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between Koreas.
China treats lizards as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often returns them forcibly.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the talks focused on the stagnant negotiations on nuclear equipment shattering.
This followed a historic meeting in June where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach to the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear non-proliferation effort.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for getting stuck in sanctions after the meeting.
“Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances we will in no case unilaterally dismantle our equipment first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his feelings, and at times he almost shouted and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee's democratic members without calling themselves "a grotesque and deliberate persecution of a person" organized by the liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony to prove that he was unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
“I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
He was afraid when asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if his choice were confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he's currently working," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
He added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions on health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative right-holder.
During the hearings on his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected as a member of the court and we would be expected to say that it is great,” Pelosi said.
Women need to get through everything.
It's a legitimate fire speech, over months and years of rage, and he can't keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you think?"
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her interlocutor in a situation where she got angry and started to cry: ‘You may think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I’m really angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius.”
Tears are justified as a path of rage, although they are generally misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when once I cried out with anger, and an older woman - a cold-hearted superior, whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me from the neck and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’ll be happy because they’ve made you feel sorry.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates already, and one was least needed.
Someone called the situation “Students and Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign time was already running out, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he announced that he wouldn’t go to the race if he didn’t get two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
It became clear to him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’m going to get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he fell into the grip of his emotions—thanks to his supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work for voters and delegates, and hatred for sexism—that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone would probably be hacked as a memoir.
“She was crying.”
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was a horrendous one, and while the battle is far from over, the country’s gap can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s main export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all imports from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded on the same scale every time, most recently by imposing customs duties ranging from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world’s second-largest economic power is becoming more sensitive for a moment.
In order to back down Washington, one should give in to one's own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependency.
“A lengthy political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create the conditions that start an economic plunge in one of the countries, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the bystanders have ever understood,” says Abigail Grace, a research assistant who is familiar with Asia at the Center for New American Security’s think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria Is ‘Ready’ to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
Circumstances now enable refugees to voluntarily return to a country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still 6 million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for aid in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the government does not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown for itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a star player from the United States, had trouble almost the entire tournament, and he punched his start in the water on the 16-hole par-3 track, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italian Molinari shined in every round and became one of the four players to score a score of 5-0-0 since the tournament was launched in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the Americas was forced out with a result of 5&4 against Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight of the Ryder Cup’s golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European ever in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said Garcia, who moved after winning the European team.
He transferred the torch to his countryman Jon Rahmi, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions on Sunday.
"I feel immense pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the routes throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, who had a high level of play throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a failed performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in the games this morning.
We're in trouble.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to get my hat up.
We met our winner.”
Situation of red tide algae blooms: concentrations fall in the regions of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to a recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decrease in the amount of algae in the Tampa Bay area.
