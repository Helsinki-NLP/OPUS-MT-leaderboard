Food inflation in Europe has slipped.
The rapid inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
The rise in prices in November in the euro area was more than expected in 13 countries, after 2.6% of October, annual inflation was recorded, reported by the Union's Luxembourg statistical office.
The official forecast is only 3 percent likely - reported by Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not, unlike the US central bank, the British and Canadian central banks, cut the base, saying that the reduction would lead to inflation spirals with rising raw materials prices and reduced unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep its inflation rate close to that.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps: “We need to talk about inflation, so that we do not have to do so later.
In Germany, inflation is 3,3 per cent as a twelve-year record; in Spain it rose from 3,6 per cent to 4.1.
Eurozone inflation has been high in terms of rising food and energy prices.
The fixed-term wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the soya beans' exchange rate reached the highest since 1973.
It was also necessary to pay significantly more for oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent of this year is already falling from 1.9 per cent in 2008 to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 per cent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB expects twice the interest rate to be reduced during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz's sponsorship has grown significantly since the beginning of December, so since 2002, he has now had the largest camp, while Gallup has not measured such low socialist support yet of 13 percent.
In the case of the Commissioners, the difference would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support for MSZP's one-thousand (20 percent) support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDS are below Parliament's threshold: their support within the whole population is two percent.
The supporters of both camps among the Commissioner's constituents are one percent more.
The economic public voice has further deteriorated to the previous depth - it has never been this high, 41% of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while it is still 46% that the situation is rather bad.
Familys are now more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the spring and summer hopeful prospects.
For the following year, the larger half of the population will be reduced by further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey of Gallip, 71 percent of those who were asked felt that the Prime Minister was rather ill than doing his job well by the Prime Minister.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the surveyors trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orban has 38 percent of the supporters.
54 percent of the government doesn't trust at all, 27 percent of Fidesz's president.
One of the indicators of the evolution of the political situation is that society is of the opinion that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the Prime Minister considered it desirable after last October, this ratio is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution.
The interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of those who have been asked will answer the question that will certainly go away and a further 20 percent says that he would probably leave.
As a comparison, at a “now Sunday election” – only 55 percent would be sure to participate and another 15 percent would be likely to be involved.
At the fees, 74 people, 79, and 84 percent of the hospital daily fee would say no.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who promise their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would take the introduction of fees, fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive Auchan, raised the Tesco by close to the fifth.
In the business triangle in Budapest, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 per cent last year, with the difference between the fact that the VAT did not rise this year.
The Day Economy Article
On average, this year, trade in Budapest has increased by 16 percent to the usual Christmas basket of the Sun, but in each hypermarket there has been a much higher growth than thousands of Forints.
In December last year, due to the fact that prices were already on the market, prices in food stores had not been shown to be a percentage of the previous high base.
However, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they received last year under nine thousand Forints is not yet available for tens of thousands.
The Napi kosara has crossed the ten thousand forints of psychological boundaries with less than 91 forints in the studied hypermarkets.
The highest basketball rate was 10 573 forints.
(The basket was added 6800 forints in 2003.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the turkey shell, the nuts, and the worms were very much more expensive.
KSH's data were followed by flour and bread prices in the stores, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not suppress the price of the product under 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre repayable bottled Coca-Cola was under 200 HUF, so that only 257 forints were requested together with the deposit fee.
This year, however, Auchan showed himself to the most expensive in the Nap's basket, while Cora was the saltiest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year's Christmas prices, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by some 18-18 percent.
Compared to the most expensive and cheap baskets this year, the difference was 12 percent, while between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive, 21 percent is growth.
In Forint, the average rate was 1480.
Last year, the average price rise was 1206 forints, with the effect of the price increase at last Christmas.
This process has been discredited by trade, it is obvious that the stores have not been able to decide how much price is applied to one product, because they were unable to calculate the impact on consumption of the price change.
(If a product is wrongly designed by the trader, it may be of serious benefit to the price adjusted for traffic intensity.)
The price increase in the Napi basket was so extreme last year, that the most expensive 1720 HUF was more than the 2006 value, whereas only 844 HUF was the lowest price difference.
This year, this extremism has not been shown, as it has now been more expensive 1630 forints than last year, and the cheapest one has been chewed with 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices of less than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily prove the data of KSH: the statistical office will increase prices by more than 30% over a period of 12 months for some basic foods.
Like flour, the egg too.)
According to the Napi kosara, this seems almost inopportune to the latter, as the price level of a fairly expensive product already last year has produced a price increase of less than 10 percent compared to the base.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the eggers, and the dramatic price increase on several have been overcome.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers don't complain, they keep reporting about a good year.
Our experience is that in the three stores that we have visited, the customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a quantity of everything, they take durable foods on platform.
Before Wednesday, all three stores developed serious lines before the cash prices, because suddenly the number of visitors increased.
However, we know that traffic is more efficient in the countryside, there are several complaints to research firms that even their plans are below revenue, and not only for food but also for long-term consumer goods.
In many places, they're saving up on fertilizers.
Over a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals this year, especially due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the greasy of beds, the overburdenness of staff do not favour stopping infections, claims to be the head doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
There are many places where they're saving up on the fertilizers.
Recently, MRSA was diagnosed as having an infection at the John Hospital's trauma class.
A man who was introduced after a serious accident showed bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
He was released from the hospital for a serious car accident, but soon later he had to return with an MRSA infection, and no major surgery had been performed since then due to the bacteria in his body.
This year, until 10 December 1094 hospital infections were reported by multiresponsible pathogens to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said the National Epidemiological Centre’s Head of Division, Böröcz Karolina.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-responsive pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest is not known.
Approximately two thirds (683 infections) of the infections caused by MRSA, namely methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried by a third of people without causing disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, manditis, skin infections, infection) respond well to antibiotics, can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not properly, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop very resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly in an inadequate hospital environment.
In the event of temporary or permanent impairment of the immune system, severe hospital infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, may occur in patients with mild, elderly or small weights.
According to the director of the John Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the flight, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Antibiotics
“We separate such patients, the care staff see the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment, ” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be examined whether MRSA is present in their system, but no infection can always be avoided.
Not a fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be prevented, however, the current hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-responsive pathogens, Böröcz Karolina.
Once this infection occurs typically in hospitals, elderly patients should be monitored by hospitals and patients carrying MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no fashion for microbiological sampling.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these studies.
In most cases, this will be the case when the patient becomes infected with MRSA, told by his departmental physician at the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are national guidelines for the healing of certain infections and diseases.
An attempt should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. to conduct microbiological studies so as not to develop resistance to medicinal products, but not to be observed in hospitals.
Microbiological samples are even more frequent in the supply of the disease or basic care, reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Sprinklers
Scientific evidence suggests that MRSA is the most frequently transmitted to one patient by healthcare personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, gloves, the use of the mask, has a very important role, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA has a drop in infection, contact, but there is always no possibility to separate the infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, hospitals have often been crowded, often very close to each other in beds, from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, it is also evident that Böröcz Karolina noted that hospitals in the adverse financial situation are saving up on infectious agents, few are nurses, many are sick, so there is even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, it is likely that such an infection may be less than demonstrated, or that further spread of the pathogen may be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes huge expenditure on health insurance and therefore they are all fighting against it.
In England, e.g. the government programme included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA.
According to the program, the success of the reported data indicates a decreasing trend in MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) priorities include multi-responsive pathogens (including MRSA) and prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
There was no drunk police captain causing death.
An official expert opinion has been prepared on the fatal accident caused by the XXII Police Commissioner.
It is not possible that he would have left his post in a drunk state or in a dead state, in the meantime, a district police captain in XXII, who had killed a pedestrian in Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the Capital Affairs Department on Friday after his expert opinion on this matter was prepared.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former police captain did not consume alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
In the street of Kossuth Lajos in the district of XXII, the head of the district police then hit the 55-year-old man on Tuesday, who didn't want to get to the other side of the road at the designated walking site.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian does not pass through the zebra, would otherwise have to give priority to a non-reducing condition under the rules of the KRESZ.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transporting to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district police officer resigned his post and requested his rest, according to the police's statement, because the case was so shocked.
This case is being investigated by the Budapest Police Department.
Attila Morvai also claimed that the former police captain cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the outset.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements, worth EUR 400 million, were signed by Mr Veres, Minister of Finance and Mr Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million in 2006 for the financing of the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which 100 million loans have already been concluded by the parties, the contract signed now concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects also provide budgetary financing for the EUR 150 million credit agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, using the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, 50 million euros of contracts were signed by the parties, which are primarily used for research and development projects at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also mentioned subway four.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the EU’s metro financing, they will return to whether it is necessary and how the original contract should be amended.
According to John Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The balance sheet shall be provided by the EIB without a deposit of 8 years of patience and without a deposit.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all Europe is paying attention to the few countries previously mentioned.
What, where and who are the EU still buying on its cheapest, yet fast-frozen market?
Analysis of Re/Max Bulgarian division.
The busiest rental destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap flat apartments and coastal houses.
Among the mountains are the oldest regions of Banskko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and Albena, the “Aranypart”, the “Napospart”, the ancient Sosopol and Neszebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will be more interested in investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are shopping in the area of cheap Rusz.
The capital, Sofia, is also an attractive option for goat, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best road to become one of the most attractive European golf clubs, so in addition to summer and winter season, it will also be a priority destination for the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying large quantities, such as in Bansko.
According to the analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lifestyles.
Most buyers come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The investors in Malta and Cyprus are also present, and in the Black Sea and ski resorts there are traditionally many Russian buyers.
Foreign customers can be grouped into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers or refurbished properties are bought at a price of between €50 and €100 000, or sunken old houses for €5-15 thousand and then refurbished.
It requires good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a large city, shops and usually the closeness of the local doctor.
The second category is the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in Bulgaria in December.
The third group is made up of commercial investors who are buying in the hope of medium or long-term value growth.
The decline of capital properties is continuing, as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, the lowest real estate prices were in the European Union, but in the last five years they increased by 21%.
The rise in real estate prices essentially exceeds the level of payments.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
According to the Minister for Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and after the formal opening, the negotiations of the ministers will continue with the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Road Plan, which provides for the efforts to be made following the emission reduction period designated by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is currently a strong debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate precise figures, although it is beginning to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question for the conference is whether developed countries are committed to reducing emissions in addition to providing both financial and technological assistance to the affected countries.
The agreement also has been reached on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund, which is provided by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the Management Board of 16 members, is expected to be read within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) in Piac and Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
Mr Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will undertake to reduce 20% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, irrespective of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and is willing to reduce up to 30 percent if other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to undertake their responsibilities and abilities.
It was said that in 1997, in total, the countries joining the Kyoto Protocol had reduced 5.2 percent, including the EU - still 15 Member States - to a minimum of 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is 6 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to the 1985-87 period that our country will meet. - reminds us of the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
High bets in Bali, as long-term international climate policy agreement should be set up within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly come after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately follow a new international emission reduction system, which is necessary in the latest report of the IPCC, the UN Scientific Council on Climate Change.
This would cause a delay in emissions reduction and make it inevitable to increase above 2 degrees of average Earth temperature, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
You're recruiting the British Army on YouTube.
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are published in the video distribution unit of the British army with which they promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) first received the YouTube: the special developments in Afghanistan have uploaded videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006 - announced the BBC.
These tapes with a miniature camera are checked at the command of the Air Force Command, then sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the internet and over 75 thousand people have watched their “channels. ”
The British Ministry of Defence – Defenceheadquarters – registered in spring 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of State (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping developments in Iraq (NFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Action in Afghanistan
According to the initial intention of the Air Force, he posted the videos for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to know the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitments - he said to the BBC's protector Gordon Mackenzie - but certainly also carries some political messages, as it proves the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
The army is also concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos will also be added to the dealer, which, for example, shows the death of soldiers: a little image, “official, ” propaganda films because officers talk about losses, but do not show the blood side of the fight.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, however, many videos have already been released on the Internet, which is made of sharp deployments, but the British army has just recently received it.
The Americans do a little differently, with a free downloadable American's Army shooting game, where the player can hide straight into the military's skin in the context of a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's Christmas at the Ministry of Tombing and Pugado.
Mr Lamperth Mónika's Minister of Labour does not seem to be intimidating: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a year-to-year work experience for his colleagues who will be able to thank you with pongacs and coffee from 2007.
You have a Ministry where you're going to have a live music party, and you're making Christmas moods in the hearts of the officials, somewhere else.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts, and coffee table - so have fun with power.
The public offices are ready for Christmas.
The largest-scale Ministry Christmas party is held this year, but the HM is not waiting for the Ministry staff.
On Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, the family members of the soldiers currently serving foreign missions will be provided at the Mission Christmas, but they will also host press reception.
The wallet will make 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GMM) will be fired from the rest of the wallet.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, with a total of 4 320 000 forints, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests from six hundred ministhelium employees.
They will stick to the Christmas atmosphere at the festival of the wallet, but there will be performers, and they'll be fateful.
Christmas of the NFÜ was 4 700 000 forints and was held on Wednesday at the National Justice Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners.
The rent cost a million HUF, spent the remaining part on over 400 invitations.
We understand that one of the NFÜ's departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from EU funds.
The building of the Vígház was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at the MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The building of the OIT was not only visited by the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of Christmas, organised the Luca Day dance on 7 December.
He didn't ask for any money to use the OIT terms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's greeting, and it could be danced to live music after dinner.
The question [origo] was asked: the ball was not compulsory at all in the dress or suit.
Puritan is throwing a party at a health, work and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and a celebration for employees at its own building for 400 000 HUF.
Mr Lamperth Mónika's Minister of Labour is officially not waiting for a Christmas party, but for his colleagues at the end of the year.
They're expecting a hundred-six guests who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and pongs, so they'll get the party out of 350 000 forints.
On the other hand, Mr Bajnai Gordon's Minister of Government will simply have coccin with his colleagues in the lobby of the Ministry of Government and Rural Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting in its own large building for 436 employees.
They're throwing 2500 forints per guest at the Christmas party - the amount of a coffee table bet and a cocktail.
Since János Veres is the minister, the employees of the PM are similar to Christmas each year.
But it's not going to be a buffoon, it's not just a minister's speech, it's just the afternoon's time.
On 20 January, the farm store will give a new annual reception, the Ministry Christmas will be missed.
The bet is held in the Vajdahunyandvár, in the Cityliget, and according to the wallet, they make 1000 forints per hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple stand-up, which is only official for foreign diplomas accredited to Hungary.
These annual bets start with a short ministerial welcome and end with a retribution.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - reported with [origo] in the relevant press classes.
They couldn't tell us about the price of the office Christmas in the environmental wallet.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Industrial Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are getting even
On Friday, they will be set up by the National Association of Liga Trade Organisations and Councils of Labour on Mondays, which co-ordinates an undeterminated strike.
Saturday protests are held, Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the end of work will begin.
The operation will certainly lead to a significant disruption in transport, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and will strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Associations shall describe the details of the Monday strike organised jointly with the National Association of Labour Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday actions.
A large meeting is held on Saturday, and organisations joining the strike will stop working for an indefinite period if they can't reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been designated on the day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly does not accept the Health Insurance Act, trade unions shall immediately withdraw the strike call.
If, on the other hand, the legislation is voted, then the strike committees will come together and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it can also be imagined that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted in late evening or at night hours.
Due to the strike beginning on Monday, there may be significant delays in transport: the work is cancelled at the train for an unlimited period, a part of the public transport in Budapest may stop before noon, more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time there will be a semi-field roadblock on many points of the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs joined the strike call, their list is constantly updated on the League Day.
Some organisations have declared strike for an indeterminate period of time, while others have declared temporary termination.
Until Thursday afternoon, MÁV and Railway Workers' Free Trade Organisation (VDSSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, and more people travel on railways when Christmas holidays are near.
According to recent reports, the BKV, Budapest Airport, has been stationed for 13 hours between 7 hours and 9 hours, with four hours of strike at LIGA's Electricity and Heat Associations, 2 hours and 2 to 8 hours of work, and the Democratic Organisation of Pedagogus and the Democratic Association of Pedagogus.
The Hungarian Medical Association maintains a national, changed time strike, a two-hour warning strike for workers in the SZEF Health and Social Sector (EDDSS).
The four demands put forward by the League are the most important thing that the government withdraws the proposal for reform of health insurance and forgive a new concept for social debate.
The second claim is to gradually introduce a new retirement method from next year.
Third, in order to ensure that senior pension is available before 2010, it is possible for working lives to be in the system.
The fourth reason for this action is that the Free Trade Organisation of Railway Workers belonging to the Liga Trade Organisations (VDSZZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport on railway wing lines, another offer is pending.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year in support of the Right Hungary, have also increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in various respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
The company’s “risk warnings” stated that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that “in the short term, even violent ethnic conflicts can arise between the population of the Hungarian Gypsy and non-Cigány.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to focus on the provocation of such an act by the research institute.
As it has been written, this can lead to a major failure of Hungarian political actors: “The public debate of the Roma case has been transferred to the representatives of radical and extreme political groupings, who could build a political strategy against the Gypsy-Hungarian-
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremes, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard under the influence of the great domestic and international media attention were significantly damaged by Hungary’s image, particularly as regards the country’s stability and democratic development.
They recall that, from the autumn of 2006, more and more public and momentum were received in Hungary as part of the reorganization of radical and extreme groups, that from the summer of 2007 several organisations called “national self-protection” were formed in Hungary.
“The common feature of this concentration is that they define themselves as a civilian organisation, while they openly declare the preparation of their members - whether they are armed - for protection (Cathrorist, Defence, Defence, Police), and referring to the failure of the police, the army, that is, the state.
It noted that this is done in accordance with the method used to put different political aspirations into a civilian robe based on the political and political coherence of society.
Therefore, the emphasis on civil society and the form of association are not simply a means of avoiding the legal failure of judicial registration for these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-raising factor for neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, in several neighbouring countries there is a potential threat to the Hungarian Guard, and some political actors from the neighbouring countries want to demonstrate their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this may have led to the political stability of the region.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
As it has been written, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the National Guard in Bulgaria, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the National Union for the Baltic Left (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian barrier, there are mass ruins that broke out in one of Sofia's quarters (Crasna Poljana).
By taking advantage of this, the BNU decided to set up the dam, saying that the organization is designed to ‘national self-protection’.
In the past 17 years, they believe that there has been “citizent terrorism” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained in vain and indifferent, reminds us of the Political Capital.
It added: the initiative has created a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Romanian organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is likely to create their own barrier.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities with the functioning of the National Guard in Bulgaria, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary also respond to the threat by organising their own protection - can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
Atila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said the interest of the telegram office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they issue their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that might affect the change in the risk, they will inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
It's not a red spell everywhere.
In Hungary, the law specifically defines the red written days, and around the holidays there has become a general practice of working day planning, which will make it less future.
There is no uniform holiday in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
The holidays can be mostly linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We also celebrate the new year: the last of the year and the first day of the new year are both holidays - the latter is only for the benefit of the sylvesters.
We have a total of eleven red-sword holidays all year round.
The national holiday is the Memorial of March 15th and October 23rd, 1848, and the Memorial of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the establishment of the state, on 1 May, and remember our family members and friends who died on 1 November and 2 May.
Plus, we have a two-day holiday for Easter, your palm and Christmas.
Since our public, national, or even religious holidays are rare according to the calendar for the weekend, working day-to-day transfer has become practical in cases where we work just one day before or after the red-sword celebration.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we will not stay away from work-school on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or following the celebration should be worked out exactly when it has to be worked out has been regulated by the Minister for Labour for many years in a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees employed by them, civil servants and those in public service law.
However, it does not affect operators and institutions operating on holiday days without interruption.
This year only the work schedule will be changed around the end of the year: life will stop almost from 24 December in the country, as it is experienced that the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve will be slipped down by the majority of people, or it will use its saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays at the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less workday transfer than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the work celebration so that the workers can stay home for four days.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day in exchange for Friday's rest day on 2 May.
The second transfer will be linked to the 23 October celebration: on 18 October, you will have to work on Saturday instead of 24 on Friday.
However, the end of the year can take full time for the celebration, as from 24 December they will have almost every nonstop break, even if it falls on Wednesday of the New Year.
Six hideous little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails, which we forget to send away, voice mails that we never receive, are innocent lies that we don't almost notice: “colored ” daily work.
Question whether you are familiar with minor inconveniences or taking the gloves, and consciously avoid misunderstandings that may cause others to get revenge.
Tips.
“ Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for a marketing department, ” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you are sorry, and you are trying to make it up to you, maybe call the marketing department to tell you you forgot to give the message (this is a less normal solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before it comes to awkward excuses, you should think about what it is that makes your colleagues uncomfortable minutes and consciously strive to avoid that.
You're buying something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching for a piece of paper, office or phone, and it's not anywhere.
Do you remember that you put your lighter on the table yesterday, but he's on his feet by morning?
Maybe you'll reveal your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without question, because they'll be justly angry at you so that you'll give away their property.
Don't put me in the pocket of office envelopes, mails, 'cause it's gonna be awkward if we run out of time, and you need it now.
Are you gossiping about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop already spreading gossip.
Who, with who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don't touch everyone's nose on the privacy of your colleagues.
If one of them divides you with the most intimate secrets, don't live with your trust.
Do not discuss with your colleagues in your absence, even if others are familiar with your colleagues.
Are you insolently sick?
When you call into the office, and you're talking about a patient referring to a diarrhea, because it's bad for you to get in touch, or feel like you'd rather relax that day; think about your work, your indeterminate work, your time-limiting work must be done for you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to go into the office the next day or something that makes you want to stay home, tell them that your colleagues and your boss won't be confronted with your absence the next day.
Dizziness, runny, phone
Did you get caught up in the job, but that's a big drag from the collages' tip?
Did you have an unsolicited ear teacher for a phone talk that you wouldn't have heard?
Do not disturb your colleagues with dudoring, singing, talking (which you are doing over their heads) or walking, constant defamation, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they do not go into a project (by writing, design, organisation).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send an important letter, send a message, don't blame me for your kindness.
Don't refer to any chaos in the office, possibly ruling your colleagues.
I want you to admit, if you've made mistakes, it's a disadvantage, and it's not a problem.
Ask him how to make up for your mistake, make it up to him.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Mac candles and slippers: comfortable wear at home, but it's not in the office!
Don't get comfortable out there if you're allowed to work.
Don't be flattered, your colleagues, and respect yourself by wearing ordinary clothes - if your job requires a job, nice and elegant - you go to the office!
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting
A scarring with the car in the usual morning traffic.
There's something special about the radio: it's a violin sound that's associated with electronic effects.
I'm going to put my voice up.
The music has become a pace, and the bass comes next to the previous tone, and then, as a real jewelry, the female choir is connected.
The number Zagar Wings of Love is on Mr. 2.
Home music life has spoiled us with a high quality electronic pop for a long time.
But now it looks like it's all different when you listen to the new Zagar record.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new and exciting productions coming from the Hungarian digital underground, are slowly changing the overall picture, and even though the guitar picks up the garage rock, the Hungarian electropop also proves: there is new under the Sun.
Züsser was about to start from Pécs, and he played in Yonderboi's band as long as - maybe, because two boobs didn't fit in a boat - he took his own trip.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, but it began to break when filming soundtracks were called for compromise (e.g.
Ferenc Törgy).
In the beginning, the formations of small clubs were known by a wider audience when their first album of thewan2 magazine was listed among the 50 most important Hungarian albums in 2002, and Zagar, Yonderboi, was exclaimed to be marketable for domestic trenders in almost single western areas.
No doubt, Zagar and the band became ‘ trendy, ’ but of course no one asked if they would like to wear the label.
The orchestra responded as it should: made a new, better record.
The album “Cannot Walk Fly Instead” can open new ways for them, although the title itself intends to create continuity with the initial years of the festival.
That's because Züsser Balaz was one of the old orchestras.
With an airy, flying reference we would be in place, but, besides the atmosphere of music, the effect of the loudest guitar, rock and roll appears now, in accordance with the spirit of the age.
In these songs, George Ligeti, who is currently working with the Puzzle orchestra in England, showed himself at the premiere of the album in Millennium.
The album also produced a real radio tracker, which played populous music from another morning to another night, Mr.2 Petőfi began to smuggle into the ears with the six Hungarian singer “Underground Divas” recorded Wings of Love's grand-scale dallamas.
Everything's all right, then (?)
Hvg.hu asked Züsser Balazs.
hvg.hu: This new slag is now asking the question: how much remains of the layer you play?
Züsser Balazs: The definition of a layer music doesn't mean too much to me.
I think there are two types of light music cast; not advertising and underground, not alternative and pop, but comedy and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, non-verbal, and can be made for sale just like that, which makes them comedy.
But you can have a good pop from being honest.
The host attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of language and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign, mostly west of us, have greater traditions of light music.
It's not just the 12th and 20th-year-old class that goes to concerts, but also the older.
More closely monitors the changes in the light music around them, as it is also considered part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
The music is not for the purpose, it is for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts, where it already works for each other, but this is only in the untapped changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to answer the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working on a solo, and he's building his career from us to the west.
Zs.B.: We're not really on his way, no matter how they try to explain it to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts in the presence of another musical player and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was likened to Yonderboi's music, as many of us were from his orchestra and we started on another road.
hvg.hu: On the top list of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was first placed.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in this number.
You're consciously open to a wider layer with a popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell the record with it.
This song is about more.
We were going to find the album's file to try and solve the sound that has been done on the record and the difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singeres?
Why exactly them - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when it came to the idea that we'd put this choir together from our own Hungarian music studios with a good voice.
That was how the six-member choir – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Boris, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], and then we crossed into Undergground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you plan the song exactly like this or did the girls make it?
Zs.B.: The number has long been in the instrumental version, and then when the disk material was assembled, we thought there would be something else to do with this number.
The time has drawn me to my singing voice.
That night, I was singing the song that the girls later learned.
It's almost first and it's all spontaneously spontaneous.
I remember he's very flashed up back then, but of course the Divas needed him.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and on the concert seemed to be the girls in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they're singing together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were on the stage.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing back was just because of technical problems.
But it's obvious that we didn't want to share solos.
And that's what it's about to forget our ego a little bit about where it came from, where it's going, just let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which job did most work have?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, none of them, rather than mixing, were harder pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play on a race piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, and then he was nice and slow about everything he had in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite song about the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with concerts and the fact that I have already allowed it to be.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The betrayal broker's feeling of lesser order has risked billions
It's incredibly creepy.
The owner of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, the French Société Générale banker, so called Jerome Kerviel.
Kerviel lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that it was rather just a big player who wanted to go out with his colleagues.
Unlike the other banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
“ He has a reduced mental capacity, ” said the police chiefs.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, it is clear from Kerviel's testimony that at the end of the last year, he has obtained a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
Change not only in America
\"I just wanted to make money for my bank,\" she said in her statement.
In summer, half a billion euros were found in the US crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, news has revealed that there will be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages for low income or customers with past cancellation problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and made me a horse.
The profit at the end of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I was looking for the first half a billion, I did not know how to report it, ” admits Kerviel, and adds that he did not keep anything for himself.
In his statement, he admits that his reports have been counterfeit so that it can't be discovered.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange started to be interested in his transactions.
The risk profit was
Were you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
“I thought that it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billions for the bank, that it reassured them, ”
Where did you want to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
He worked at the Société Générale bank from 2000 after the University of London.
His annual salary moved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and he became a self-restricted broker in 2005 with $90,000 a year.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never make as much money as others did.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me with the wrong eye.
Also because of my skill, my professional and personal development, Kerviel told the detectives.
After he left, the first great success came soon.
He was looking for allianz's shares because during the bombings in London, he raised half a billion euros to fall these shares.
And it started a lavino, and it wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
“It’s like a snowball, ” he told the police.
But your bosses are supposed to know everything or more.
“When I made money, they were gone.
Only that there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to hide in the middle of January one weekend.
When he started work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him suspicious.
“I only bought four days in the last year.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his reports,\" Kerviel finished.
Czech Republic has a chance to acquire 365 billion
The Czech Government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic could raise EUR 14 billion in the coming years (about 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will be about 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion dollars from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion crowns, is for transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base for the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed by a rate of (0.8 billion next year.
The Business and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win innovation tools.
Companies should also obtain resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is the least successful in winning funds from the EU funds in the context of the new countries.
The court approved the 20-year prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaraguan
On Thursday, the U.S. Appeal Court approved 20 years of prison sentence to Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, for the financial fraud of USD 100 million in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and was in house arrest in his near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be back behind bars, according to the AP News Office, it is not clear yet.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ilena Perez, it will depend on the prison leadership to leave Aleman's sentence at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court has demonstrated to Aleman that he regularly referred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictional companies and their account numbers were actually related to relatives and nearest supporters.
He then made some of these funds at the Foundation, which was based on the funding of Alemán's election campaign in 2001.
We have a budget approved.
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget established by this government, adopted by the coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year, he went through with the support of Social Democrats last year, as the Minister of Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party could not allow non-acceptance.
Unlike the pre-voting distrust of the government, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives has accepted this generally ignored, although the most effective law has been passed.
It's a certain contradiction.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but the government and the opposition's powers are hidden behind them.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why media gives much more attention.
Politicians' discussions for the public are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the socialist democratic governments in the past were struggling with three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high percentage of compulsory, so-called 'responsibility' legislation, which not only means pensions, but also social benefits, which last year are approved before the elections by ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is, as a result of the first flaw, deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. budgets for cities and flights.
However, the greatest risk is not the public budget deficit.
This is under public and relatively controlled control.
Timed bombs are the budget deficits for cities and flights.
A number of mayors are also able to make money for other investments, in addition to taxes, taxes and bank loans, and often have issued bonds with which their towns have been disproportionately sold.
In recent years, these debts have been cancelled by a massive sale of the shares of the energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will establish that:
Like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a period of growth that the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to restructure public funding.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries have managed with one or two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, in the Czech Republic much more rationally.
This is, above all, a huge shame of previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least threatened by poverty in global terms.
For example, there is no need for large-scale social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been completely depressed into gigantic size in recent years.
Even though this year it has been possible to eliminate the part of the pointless populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no retirement and pension reform in the near future, any policy will actually end in this country, and whoever governs it, it will only be a recruitment.
With a little overage it can be said that the majority of taxed money from the governor's politicians is generally retired and that social benefits become their mechanical distributions.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop it from being reduced by the staff of ordinary expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the previous governments had not taken everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to become mere officials from the governor's politicians, then we must be patient and wish our peace to prepare for further reform laws, which is not too strong, is well-known for the coalition government that the state can only get out of taxes and taxes.
Only this will allow a gradual achievement of the balanced budget.
Mr Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The central banks of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
Money markets are thus costing more than USD 100 billion through stock exchange.
On this stock exchange, the bank will increase the interest rate for which it is ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will issue USD 40 billion for the stock exchange, and it will make an additional twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central bank.
Following the 11th September attacks, first of all, the central banks of each country agreed in a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the major problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks would be able to borrow, ” wrote Bernard Baumohl, a consultant from Economic Outlook Group in his report.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent, ” added Baumohl.
The banks in the United States have already lost $60 billion due to non-repayable loans.
There are still billions of losses.
“The central banks may indeed fear what might happen if they decided to do so, ” said Kieran Davies, ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad, ” he added.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves are difficult to access loans, they will also lend loans to their customers more expensive.
This would reduce the need and restore the American economy with the potential consequences for economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks then decided that LIBOR did not manage to reduce the interbank interest rate used to borrow money on the interbank market in London.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual borrowing, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Great Britain have reduced their interest rates a few times during the fall.
“It will have a similar effect to this further reduction in interest, ” said Greg Salvaggio to the Reuters news agency from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps of central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as they do not solve the underlying problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Incredible Discussions of Ecologists
Global climate change is the main threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The Book of the Blues in Vienna, not the green planet, made it seem incredible to discuss the ecologicals.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between this accompanying rhetoric and reality.
\"The debate there absolutely prevents the structure, it's just throwing words, which are a supplement to solving the current problems,\" Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for his topic, which is why he is so committed to this issue.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book is also published in German translation, as he said, “I often only meet with the caricatures of my opinion, ”
So now I'm interested in reading your unscrupulous opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he was not a climatologist, he felt that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
As professional findings can be monitored and assessed as academics, the statistics and the economist have also been studied.
As a testament to the completion of the book, climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and there is no consistent opinion on the planet's warming, all scientists say that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so there is no danger and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a human experience in totalitarianism, it considers it unacceptable to place unconfirmed opinions on others, which is perceived as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained the current questions that “the environment is not against reasonable protection, but against militant enviromentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.
Similar topics Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people couldn't change their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old license in time, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time you can ask for an exchange so that the agencies can set up a new licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will leave without valid rights.
According to the agencies, the license was primarily not replaced by those who no longer want to drive.
While cases constitute a serious fall in interest in the exchange of rights, the metropolitan offices have been charged with requests for legal exchanges for which they have increased interest this week.
The High Commissioner's office will receive about 2,000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140000 drivers have not changed their license.
It's gonna take 20 days to issue a new license.
However, the new licence may be requested by a shorter period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver must pay an extra 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to complete the compulsory transfer of rights by the end of the year and who are on their way with an invalid status threatens to be punished from January.
The sinner must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the extremism through an agreement.
In the event of a public administrative division, the penalty shall be 2500 krona.
Based on the previous information received from the City Hall, you can also receive a fine that does not travel anywhere.
It's supposed to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry previously called on the agencies to be negligent and impose fines of up to a maximum of thousands of crowns.
However, according to the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened by tens of thousands of fines.
He thinks that the license is a document where people can decide whether or not they want to.
This is not an ID which must be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should tell them about the driver's license.
Enough to take it or recommend to send it to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually replace other types of licenses.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can change for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 only takes place in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment of Bedycchel's undercover detectives.
Joseph Opava and Petr Koňañík were policemen suspected of being in conflict with David Berdych's crime cell, they received 13 and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court in Prague has decided on this, which has reduced their sentence for one of them two years.
Detectives in the Penetration Division were originally threatened by a 14 and 12-year-old prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, but it can only be applied for at the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, only waiting for the first judgment.
In other procedures, he has already received more than 16 years of punishment.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found primarily 19 men to be guilty of robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court held 16 appeals today.
The majority of the defendants rejected the accusations from the beginning of the investigation by refusing to be a speculation case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police members of the police, in addition to information from police sources after the Berdychel agreement, were able to provide information to criminals, to cover the individual robbery attacks, and to help the gang to avoid being involved in criminal prosecution.
That's why the gang dropped 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňaří.
This is about the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
It is primarily a robbery whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of their powers of civil servant and not allowed to be armed.
Because the police found guns kept illegally in search of the house, steel core bullets, laser direction or machine gun.
The gang was accused of robberys of tens of millions of crowns.
A band of twenty members of the court has already been recognised as legally guilty of other robberys of Berdych and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first stage trial has so far avoided Tomáš Putat and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial arrest in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on their prosecution to the Czech Republic.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, who has been replaced by birth, requires 12 million crowns of pain and extra court expenses from the hospital in tēebíč.
For mothers three million each, for fathers two million and for children a million.
As a parent, the hospital offers up to 200,000.
The legal representative of the hospital, Mr Dostal Veleba, has essentially disagreed.
“We reject this claim because it is too much, ” said Dost after today’s trial.
“We need to make an opinion on the proposal for a resolution, and we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll see if there's any value to be used.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands of times for everyone, who stressed Dostal.
He thinks the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč to four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was awarded an expert assessment on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the University Hospital of Prague.
Children's parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, have suffered various degrees of mental damage and stress.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they had met with an eye loss that they had not prevented the newborn exchange.
Women are worse off with the actuality of the trauma they're experiencing and what's happening right now, and they've got all the contents together.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses on 9 December in the culture of tēebíč.
Last week, children returned to their bloody parents - Nikola Čermák to Pēibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jabloňov.
Vysočina's flight manager, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered ten0,000 crowns to the families at the end of October, which came from the fault of the hospital in tēebíčské, which is controlled by the process.
All Czech hospitals have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of default, they must reach the reserve fund and may request help from the founder in exceptional circumstances.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for humans, the sums have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional circumstances, of a few million interest tables.
Polika lost his kingdom in Valsko
Bolek Polílka lost his case for the address of the V.A. Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostraai Court, although he first used the name of the King of Valach, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabish, who cooperated with the color.
Polika didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to the legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the customer will appeal.
“The debate is that Mr Harabish and his team live on the popularity of Bolek Poliveka, ” said Polílka’s lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that in the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, everyone is the actor-chomic.
This opinion is also shared by Harabish.
“ There are almost ten years of work behind us.
Finding money and making up actions, he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is the money.
“In years, they realized that the project was successful and could win something from it.
They want to live from our work, ” he added.
Future business
According to the court, the King of Valchi was first used in Polítka's television show.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building the fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came forward with the idea of issuing letters from Valach.
The original student training operation was formed into a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, which was then based on the creation of a society of the Vázsko Kingdom.
In 1997, with the indication of the agreed name and signature of Polítka in passports and even the preferences of their owners when visiting its farm and theatre presentations.
Who's taking the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabish only used the idea that Polílka made public in the Manesz for his business.
“Boleslav Polivka’s popularity has certainly helped the Valach Kingdom project, ” said the judge.
However, he added that the project's soul was Harabish and his team that was intensively involved in it.
The cooperation of today’s conflicting parties continued until 2000 when Harbiš organised an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polítka and Harabish have been accumulated, which have been “impressed into the salvation of King Boleslav forever. ”
In the kingdom, the leading role of Harabish took over Jarmila Šulakova as queen.
In 2002, Polílka Harabish and his associates then filed a court appeal against him, which the court today rejected.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light into the debate for the throne and for the Queen's half.
It should be a new king from this fight.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
It should be something like the Slovacko kingdom.
The king should be chosen for a firm time.
Mr. Polílka can also speak freely, ” added Harabish.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: missing prejudices
To be honest, I never liked Peugeot 206.
Its properties are nothing special, the quality of change, management and production can often be considered as average subjects.
But the already present offspring on the market, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combi called SW goes on with a lot more, so for me, there's nothing left than thinking about it.
When I tested the Peugeot 207 classic Hatchbacks, for example, I complained to the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaint is over here, because Kombi's karossyria means that there are no longer two meters high in this respect.
Fürgen in the World
I'll get through the interior soon enough to stop repeating myself many times.
It's about a very successful design where I have my sole objection to poor console.
I'd appreciate an inventory of designers if the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the arms.
Side drive has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the karosseria.
And then, in the combia, the head disappears from the little place that has already been mentioned.
I'll hide in the trunk.
The main thing about this vehicle is packaging.
This is very well available (and thanks to the running rear window) and should be measured at large.
The empty spaces are equipped with long-range rubbers, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they can be pulled and they can handle harder things.
But let's stay at the volume for a while.
On the basis of these tables, 428 l of the basic arrangement, which is more than average in relation to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, the most wanted car in this class is Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the product of the new generation in Boleslav, we find that Peugeot will be well behind many 52 liters.
For a foreign holiday or for a baby car, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost straight floor after the second row's backs or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a six-l volume, 88 kW power, four cylinders with an alien ignition engine.
And to tell you the truth, that's how you're supposed to look at a thousand thousand, which is driving the family hatchback.
Quiet, small-scale, and mainly pull.
If we compare it to Škoda's fitr, which often affects as if they've locked a rag in his exhaust, then I can only be happy about that.
Help is Price
Car prices aren't cheap.
We must remember, however, that we tested a large interior and a very good motored car.
The car is leaving for 329 900 Kč with a four-legged alien motor.
Car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is a lot.
The Premium equipment tested drop the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Only that we still have headbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wipers, rear windows were also electric remote control....
Which means the car costs 531 900 Kč with a t-shirt.
This is many, but calculate the Fabia's additional equipment and get a very similar result.
So there's nothing left but a brand decision.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, more and more children in Eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of violence between children of immigrants and domestic residents.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well reflected in a situation in the north-east where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
The differences between students, the ties, are already the relationship between parents.
So far the situation is that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who said a ten-year-old student with iron.
The sinner defends the boy from insulting him with racist sparks.
The police had to go after two twelve-year-old girls in Slovakia attacking immigrants.
The girls claimed that the man was strangled with racist comments and dumped with stones.
“When we were on our way home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and nails, and then revealed his naked back, “the mother of the Slovak students described the next unpleasant incident for the Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents classified discussions on immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival fight.
The above mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between local and immigrant schools in Britain is getting tense.
In Great Britain, there are obviously 70 thousand jobs in Slovakia.
About 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
The island of freedom is indeed for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, are calm as a humidifier.
Pálmafák and all inclusive with cellars offering pizzeria, ice cream or mammoth cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and Roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a whole and even more rich list.
However, you can find much more on an island, and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antillies.
During the Spanish days, Cuba had a mine for their American conquerors.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havanna has become a treasure store and a crossbow that was kidnapped and transported to Europe by the Spanish people in America.
Then the American era followed.
Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the U.S. mob, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (prevention), was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, there were guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower houses were built, car cars became a symbol of the culture of the years of the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he owned his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio tree decorates the stars and politicians of American show business.
What about today?
You can also supply the wall of the Havana Bodeguita with your hand stamp.
They're mixing you cocktails at the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel.
And the cults of the '50s travel to Havana for today, because it once exported chips and boys in this salty and wet air have long since been rotting.
Although the oldest part of Havanna was significantly surprised, there are no such beautiful colonic monuments anywhere else in the area.
Other places are more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the necessary money, its development has received a green path.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba in the world still offers a unique hunger which is evaluated primarily by train lovers.
From their extended plantations, sugar cane was transported to the sugar plants for steam and motorcycles.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines that can only be seen in museums.
Where do we go?
Most of the most well-known places for Cuba's visitors are not avoided.
So Varader or Havana doesn't have to write too much.
Perhaps we should remind ourselves that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway floor and who loves the author, not to miss the visit to this museum.
Viňales valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The misdemeanor vegetation is growing from the slaughter.
The soil of the valley and its groves, the larvae and the rocks rise on steep slopes, and the soil that is fertilising in its roots, which also covers the soils that have been scattered.
The valley is a place where the best quality Cuban tobacco may be produced.
With its ultimate form, one of the cigar manufacturers in Havana can meet at the time of the visit.
Some may find it interesting to see that there was the episode of Major Zeman in Chile.
Trinidad
The ancient city, founded shortly after the island-colonisation of the Spanish.
The slave and sugar trade has brought fame and glory.
The economy has killed the body in the beauty and monumentality of the city that is not too great.
The Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, changed almost nothing in four centuries.
The Trinidad between the Escambray plains and the sea is such that even in the 50th century, there were no roads that would have been connected to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break it, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon to Trinidad, it's worth watching the interesting places around you than Playa Ancón Beach or Sugar Factory Valley.
And tonight, you'll be able to go to Casa de la Música, which will wake you up after dark, where music will be quiet only by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities located in the eastern part of Cuba consider it the most beautiful city.
I'm sure this opinion is already affecting the way.
Both of Guantanamo's roads need to fight high and structured mountains, leading through almost a very few people's activities.
The eastern language of Cuba, thanks to its inconvenient nature, has been included in the World Heritage List.
Here's the best chocolate, the church's cross of Colombia (in fact, a hundred years after the cruise of Colombia) and the hill where the former castle stood and the El Castillo hotel stands today, some of which are most known as El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, the Disno Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabare, the Caridad del Cobra Cuban statue, the Santeria, the African religion that the successors of former slaves can write about.
The way they say it right, it's better to see it.
The Afghan allies are passive, claim to be Americans.
The lack of military and necessary equipment also affects the course of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
According to Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghanistan mission is not going on according to the idea, and the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, whose units are located in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries also negotiate further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Minister for Defence Robert Gates has called for greater activity this week for NATO troops, Britain considers the Afghan Government to be a priority for strengthening development assistance.
“Afghanistan development can be done, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other is allowing the public to start further development of the economy and security, ” said the British Minister for Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan ascenders is reported by the US government to be the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27% compared to last year, and 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter in the southern regions.
However, according to the United States, allies have also reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the troops.
They specifically requested additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think about the specific objectives of the future and how to achieve them, ” says Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today to the NATO secretary-general, Jaap de Hoop.
“I am not happy about what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's not enough,\" said Reuters news agency De Hoop at the end of the three-day talk with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
In recent months, there are also discussions between the participating countries about whether all Allies are providing maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for her passivity.
“The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where violence and combat requirements are least low, so they are not as high as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,\" said Gates.
The Sun's British Bulgarian page this week called the German soldiers a spoon.
“The Afghan suns were like: Germans play as long as our sons are fighting, ” said Sun in a material supplemented by the photo of the German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild was under attack and published a photo of the Rögbimecs of a British team in the southern Afghanistan.
Government debt reached one billion in 2009
All Czechs have 84.000 crowns of government debt.
By the end of September, the total debt reached the rate of 842.7 billion.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by an increase of 152.8 billion, thanks to better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the State debt of the Czech Republic reached the rate of 842.7 billion.
In the nine months of this year, it rose with a crown of 40.2 billion.
However, June decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has thus demonstrated its government debt data from the beginning of October today.
All Czechs have more debts than 84.000 crowns.
Last year, the state has owes more than 11 billion crowns.
“For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we can only go beyond the one billion rate limit in 2009.
The next year, debt will be around 900 billion and a billion crown,” mentioned the analyst of the iHNed.cz server Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the analysis of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees this: “In 2009, we can go through the transition of a billion.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget that is unknown for the moment.
If it were to prove that the situation in the area of politics would change, politicians would be willing to make more savings, and this could continue until 2010.
But I don't expect this change to be mentioned.
Increased debt
Government debt is the debt of the central government, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of government budget deficits.
State debt is financed by notes, public loans, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
This year, the state's internal debt has increased by 38.5 billion to an increase of 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has yet increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion crowns.
By the end of September, the so-called saleable government debt decreased by 803,3 billion interest rates and by 13,7 billion interest rates from June.
The average rate of government debt rose for 6.5 years.
“The total debt in the first quarter has increased by 13 percent, which is indeed quite much compared to the progress of the economy.
It is interesting that the rise is primarily generated in loan bonds, where the rise is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will be due to trade when the pension reform comes here, “Pika commented on the data.
You'd better wait
From its funding strategy and the 2007 state debt management, the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion krona this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by an increase of 152.8 billion, thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily a deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach the EUR 76 billion instead of the assumed rate of HUF 91.3 billion this year.
In addition, the Czech Confederation planned a maximum increase of 13,3 billion, a ten billion reserves for pension payments, the financing of State loans at 43 billion interest rates and the repayment of loans worth 1.8 billion from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in the court of Carpathian because of the name given to a gunman.
On Thursday night, a cartel court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and exit from the country because of the violation of Islamic law.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a gunman Mohammed. However, Islamic religion denies any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by suffocation.
The 54-year-old British woman who was a teacher at the Unity High School in Kartúm was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. Based on paragraph 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, she was accused of violations and rebellion of Islam after the students' parents filed a complaint against her several times at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students from 6 to 7 years of age to choose a name for the class's bully.
“ The children suggested a total of eight names, including the Hassaan, Abdul and Mohammed, ” says Robert Boulos.
Finally, with 23 out of 20 children, Mohammed chose the first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common Christian name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary with the picture of the macco, and “My name is Mohammed. ”
The problem is that the representation of the Prophet's work is a violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague at the same school, said that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious belief. He said only about “the unsatisfied mistake, ” he said: “I am sorry that he voted with the children.
Many of his students agree with this opinion. They say that the teacher “he is very good with the children, ” and“ even if he does not speak about religion in the class, ”
Let us remember that the second most popular first name in Mohammed Nagy-Brittannia and 14 different ways of writing exist in English.
This Muslim family so often chosen is one of the ways to express respect for the prophet. (The first - born child of the family gets this name.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get this name, for example, a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna talks in Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
The talks between the Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo on the future status of the Separatist province ended without approaching the positions in the Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It is regrettable that the parties did not reach an agreement on status, ” announced Mr Ischinger's EU diploma at a Brussels press conference.
The U.S. Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is at risk, and encouraged Belgrade and Pristia to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
“In the near future, there is no need to avoid violence, but it is a very difficult period to deal with, stressing “the existence of apparent tensions. ”
The Mediation ends on 10 December
The last visit to Serbia and Kosovo is the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the province of the Albanians in 90 percent can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian broker, Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko will submit his report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, has been the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN in August last year entrusted the troika with another mediation.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation task to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already challenged Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, will continue to negotiate after the expiry of the deadline.
\"Russia was committed and remains a negotiated solution, in addition to compromise,\" said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After 8 years under the leadership of the UN, Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina informed me that she was willing to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“We have not been able to reach an agreement,” announced the President of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Badeni, where we have been “the last chance of negotiations” since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Uprising and future Prime Minister of the Province also expressed regret.
He added, however, that the idea of the autonomy of Belgrade would be to continue the past in murder and deportation.
\"Domino Effect\"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that the compromise was still possible and the Albanian majority in Kosovo warned about the consequences of the unilateral cry of independence.
Belgrade is still in an unstable area because of the nineties' independence wars.
“This does not exclude the possibility of compromise for Serbia, ” said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again said that the decision should only be the Security Council, where the Russian ally has the right to veto.
\"The last word for the Kosovo Parliament will be \"
“For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” announced the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostonica.
\"The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council –
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that “the last word of the Kosovo Parliament will be the word, ” added that the unilateral cry of independence by the Albanians is based on the agreement with the Western powers.
Bush urges an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of the International Peace Conference in Marryland Annapolis, that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Eud Olmert and the Palestinian President, Mahmúd Abbasz, agreed immediately to open a debate between their peoples for a final settlement of 60 years.
Bush made a promise in the presence of the two presidents that they would be able to support them in any way possible way so that they could sign the \"Capture Agreement\" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to cut off the \"terrorist networks\" and Israel has to abandon its colonizing activity and remind the two parties of their obligations with regard to the \"best plan\" adopted in 2003.
The President of the White House stressed that the objective of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel led by Abbasz was to sign a peace treaty that addresses all the problems that are dependent, including central issues.
The latter concern the three delicate problems of the Israeli-Palestin debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees from their homes during the conflict in 1948, who lived in the territory of the state of Israel.
After the President of the United States, Abbasz maintained that future negotiations would be “global and profoundly effective” and would affect all areas of regulation, such as “Jorus, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security”.
He then promised Olmer that future negotiations would be \"direct and continuous\", and he would strive to \"end even in 2008\".
By the end of 2008 Bush set up the implementation of the waters of the existing Palestinian and Israeli two states.
Saudi Arabia said that Bush was promised to do so before he decided to attend the conference.
With the support of all Arab countries, Saudi Arabia (now known as the success of the Annapolis) has launched a plan that guarantees peace to Israel when it comes to the withdrawal of all Arab territories in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a response to the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem in the roots and concentrates on central questions, ” says the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Arab daily newspaper.
According to the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What happened exactly on Sunday?
As usual, it is common to have such news, the official position and speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the national police (IGPN) on Sunday, after 17 minutes, a police car went on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
“The car was en route, so it wasn’t in action. It was 40-50 km/hour without sirensing, ” we learned from the police source.
The two helmets with “high speeds” were driven by a green, “no official registration, therefore not to be used in road traffic – (see below) with a branded engine in Kawasaki.
“When the right-hand rule was not respected, the engine hit the left side of the police car, ” says a police officer.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car has sprung, the windshield of the star, and the bumper has fallen.
In an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning by Mr. Pontoise's attorney, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate were entrusted with the investigation launched because of the failure to kill and assist people who had been in need.
During the afternoon, the D.A. told a press conference that the responsibility of the police at the current stage of IGPN investigation can be excluded.
According to the D.A., the interview was confirmed by three witnesses on Sunday night, “the police report that the warden arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car”
On the day before yesterday, a line, which was no doubt pulled by the pedestrians on the road, has shown that the two vehicles collapsed and went together for a while, until the police car was able to cover it.
Vehicles have been booked for technical testing.
The body of the two victims was subjected to medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, the talk in Villiers-le-Bel spread as a running fire, according to which the police quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this respect, IGPN is careful to say, but it cannot be ruled out that the police did “any serious mistake. ”
“This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and it requires increased caution, ” we learned from the police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported it a few minutes after the accident.
One of his windows looks exactly at the scene.
“ With my cousin, a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to relive them, ” she says.
“We had nothing to do with it.
Then he observed “a police officer who was completely confused and shocked. ”
The other two tried to relive one of the young, and the fourth called, “
The tension among the present people has increased, as the hopeless situation of the two young people has become apparent, so their colleagues from the site were transported by the police car.
We also know from the witness’s statement that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They used a heart massage, but they didn't.
“I would not say that the police did not try to help young people.
Young people did get help.
Firefighters arrived immediately at the scene.
They have done everything they can to save them, and the prosecutor stressed.
She's got tension in Pakistan.
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations after the emergency introduced two days earlier by General Musarraf.
According to the witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, about two thousand lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken during the emergency period were injured by the tear gas bombs used by the police.
In response, they dumped the police with stones, many of whom were injured.
They made at least 350 lawyers.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded lawyers.
More persons were produced.
In Islam, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike, and protests were reported for the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers on the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several protests in Multan and Peshawar, Northwest.
Since Monday, the great Association of Agahida Majlis-e-Amal, which blocks religious parties, has supported the movement of lawyers.
“Musarraf’s promise is no longer valid”
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court should declare, in the days to come, the legality of the re-election of President Musarraf by an indirect vote of 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has moved from his office and has been replaced.
“What we are witnesses of is illegal, ill-constitutional, and contrary to the judgments of the Supreme Court, the President said to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army for the civilian presidency's role was announced on Monday by Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to deal with the military uniform until the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed the news on the postponement of the elections in January.
The Pakistani Government, by way of example, has encroached the country-wide rumor that President Musarraf would have appointed a place of coercion as a general.
More than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This result includes unsolicited (24%) or unsolicited or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third of pregnancy (36%) has not been planned - it is clear from the study of the French National Demographic Institute (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unsolicited (24%) or unsolicited or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different contraceptive methods, such as tablet or beespiral, are still failing in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made the birth control more effective, and the study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but now this rate is 60%.
Today, from 10 pregnancys, 8 are planned.
Every five months is designed with precision, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most pleasant season to receive the child.
Visual repair at space station
Scott Parazynski's spaceman and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work for more than seven hours in space to implement the spectacular improvement of the solar field essential to the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space pattern has proved to be a record in many respects: the repair has been for a very long time, very little time to design, and far from the residential modules, it had to be carried out by astronauts with tools “scrazy. ”
The problem occurred on Tuesday, when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see the framed part).
This module is a kind of passage to the laboratory modules.
However, their power supply needs to be looked after.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer one module that produced electricity with the help of the 17.5 tonnes solar panels, which was already on ISS, to its final location.
The crew then started opening the wide solar panels of the module 76 meters wide.
One of the flat-rate tablets was then damaged by one of the wires in length of about 1 metre.
In order to avoid further injury, the table was not opened.
The original task of astronauts was to take a control walk from the Discovery space shuttle and to repair another missing solar module. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repair the damaged solar module.
Scott Parazynski had a choice to perform the stunt hanging on a 30-metre robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He is one of NASA’s best walking walkers.
He's tall, strong, extremely good, with muscle on his upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor thus had to “oppose the damaged solar board. ”
After thoroughly measuring the damage caused, he cut the wrong cable and fixed the damaged area with a few “silvers. ”
He also helped another “space walker ” who remained near the safe passage and from inside the other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool used by it, a mini hockey robot, which was seen by an insulating several hundred volts of solar panels, the spaceships of the station were defrosted and “cracked. ”
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates completely opened the board and then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts held a half-day rester, and today, at seven, they returned to Discovery's space chlorine to begin their return to Wednesday.
Exchange rate of EADS shares
The exchange rate of EADS shares fell large on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company producing aircraft and defence equipment announced that the development of A400M will result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% reduction.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is why it is likely that the landing of the aircraft will continue to take place.
The delay in the transfer of a fighter aircraft reported in October will amount to between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, with more than €1 billion being affected by Airbus\", reported to the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of this expenditure, EADS will have to report new design figures on its operating results for the next Thursday of 2007, when reporting quarterly results, the company added but did not provide additional figures.
The group also indicated that it took account of the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS decreased its operating performance by 86%: this was largely due to the delay in the development of another programme, A380 machine, which also imposes a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally designed to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Keep status quo
Sunday elections do not promise a big surprise: the great majority of Russians will vote for the Prime Minister of Putin, the Single Russia.
In this Russia's need for stability, to be said to be self-evident in government after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Vlagyir Putin, Russian Head of State, will speak to the voters in television through public service channels, which have already been recorded, but content is still secret.
Putin is leading the Kremlt Support Party, the Single Russian candidate list, which is expected to win a devastating victory in the elections.
When the foreign ambassadors received yesterday, the Prime Minister's behaviour did not tell us anything: he had just another attack on the interventions of Western countries, which was the subject of the campaign.
“We know what the price for true democracy is, so we want absolutely transparent and open choices, without any infringement, ” he added.
However, the opposition says that this is not an early situation.
The opposition condemns the campaign, according to which they put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gengyrij Zjuganov, claims that “it was not such a dirty election in Russia even in the time of Jelcin. ”
After the last weekend protests, the former chess champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration and his lawyer claimed that he could not continue to visit.
“The Russians are still thinking as a \"homo pancakes.\"
The available election results raise two more obvious issues:
Who's following Putyin in the head of state?
The first round of the presidential election was published yesterday in the Official Journal, which will take place on 2 March 2008 and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention to start until 23 December 2008.
Since Vlagyir Putin has been elected in 2000 and 2004, its mandate is no longer extended.
But you don't have another successor on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and on the President as the Universal Russia Party or as the leader of the majority of Parliament?
Whatever happens, the power to leave will be won at both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's now leftovers.
“The Russians are still thinking of the \"homo panthetic\" way: they do not feel they can control their fate,” says Lev Gudkov sociologist, director of the independent Levada center.
The history of Nikolai Komosov, the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: the theory is that the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so there is also a delay in the development of civil society, and the traditional Community spirit has reversed the development of individualism.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putyin returned to the patentist model, which was perfectly in line with the people. More importantly, because this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by fear, but was accompanied by certain economic well-beings, Maria Lipman, co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians reject personal responsibility, which was quickly demonstrated following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
\"Why should we think?
The phenomenon affects all sections of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Single Russia are led by 65 Governors, who are members of the 85 Russian region.
And freedom imported from the West often bodies chaos, as has happened in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednichenko 54 - year - old teacher concluded: “Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?
Pressure memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the hitler regime.
The 47 million archives document, which includes 27 kilometres of polls in Bad Arolsen, Hessen, has so far been researchable for the purpose of ‘humanity’, i.e. only a unique and name-specific approach to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all States ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday's day.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to conduct research “in connection with the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, Director of the Red Cross International Commission.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents, as they contain names and thus contain confidential information.
For example, it may be the assumed homosexuality or mental disability of certain deported victims.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The purpose was to investigate civilians who were deported or forced to work on these grounds and perhaps to serve with evidence of their intervention, which would give you compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently engaged in processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider it of great importance to open the Bad Arolsen archive.
“These documents are basically nothing new, ” announced Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Institute for Anti-Emepticism of the University of Technology at Berlin in 2006.
The EU-India Free Trade Agreement would be signed in 2008
The turnover of intra-European bilateral trade at annual level is now close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU's number one trading partner in India and gives 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping that they will be able to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008 - announced by Peter Mandelson European Trade Commissioner and Minister of Commerce Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers have already approved in April last year that the European Commission launch negotiations on signing free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU's number one trading partner in India and gives 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also the main foreign investor in India, but India is the 9th most important trading partner in the EU according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that \"a free trade agreement for both parties could have an economic impact\", and \"India could thus increase its presence in a 450 million residential flowering market\"
The ten most important products exported by India are Europe's first and secondary importers. At the same time, the two giants, Europe and Asia, each year, share €47 billion, and exchange €10 billion of services, announced by Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, who expressed regret that the bilateral trade \"has not always achieved the full potential of the EU and India on Friday, New Delhi, in the context of the eighth diplomatic summit, which is attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Reply to the concerns: Bank of England offers 10 billion pounds to the money market for five weeks running time
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the anxiety about credit conditions, so on Thursday, he announced that he would pump 10 billion English pounds on the money market, which he would normally have made available at this time of five weeks.
“We want to improve the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered in the context of a five-week open market operation in the international money market, with the Bank’s press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December, at 12:15 p.m. local time.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The running of such operations is usually a week.
In the press release of England, the Bank added that ‘to take further measures to ensure that interbank loans are adapted to the central bank’s base.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the financial market crisis in the summer, Bank of England has received significant criminal interest on the amounts invested in the money market, which has prevented the banks from using them.
According to the word (which only confirms the evolution of the price of the font compared to the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been achieved by more favourable interest rates and greater discretion.
The UMP and the NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on consumer power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre have closed up the discussion of articles of the Social Agenda on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The text negotiated at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures, adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, including an increase of 50% in the employment supplement, the restoration of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of the travel check and the restriction of rents.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the review of the articles, the discussion of the government party and the opposition at some times in sharp terms has ended, only a few hours before the television talk of President Sarkozy's purchasing power.
The Head of Socialist Delegation, Jean-Marc Ayraul, announced that all his group's proposals would be resubmitted in the context of the amendment to the draft corrective financial law, which will be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
New festival born
A number of rumors were conducted in connection with the new film festival organized by the C3 Presses. However, the event-organizing and popularizing company announced that Melvin Benn will be held in New Jersey in collaboration with the British producer at the Festival Republic.
“It is an honor for us to work with a man who is starting today’s American festival movement, ” said Billboard.com, Charlie Jones from C3.
The C3 also organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in summer, so there will be a way to tent.
The festival will be held in a private area of 500 acres of private space from Philadelphia between 8 and 10 August.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's greatest honorary festival organisers.
In 1989 he started the UK Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn extended his palette with the order of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic invited the Latitude Festival to the Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002 Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival's production, licensing and organisation tasks. This festival is now able to accept up to 177 500 people.
The C3 co-worker, Charlie Jones, was called the Glastonbury Festival, which he has never participated in. He added that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to making the region rich with a European-style festival.
“We have chosen the phidelphian location before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we have worked hard to organise this festival in the centre of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
\"We continued with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, due to the political maneuvers of urban management, the organization failed, Charlie Jones continued.
“We were able to speak to Melvin Benn on the contrary, and we are now preparing to organize a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the inhabitants of Philadelphia.
The C3 Press brought back the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after proven its exceptional festival planner's talent with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events was 9.8 million in 2007 and 11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held at the city site.
\"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals are usually in urban green areas,\" says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban lifestyle that is common in America.
Vineland is located between Philadelphia and Atlantic City about a half-way.
“Vineland’s population, and even the mayor himself, are keen to support the event, ” says Charlie Jones.
Although not talking about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are good enough to allow such an event to be invested at a location that hopefully provides home to the festival for a long time. ”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival is going to be a “great ” size, with its reception capacity approximately 80 000 people in Bonnaroo, Tensse.
The groups have already received the invitation to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will be basically a rock festival, but we are planning a variety of musical offers to make everyone happy, ” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, together with the C3 company, who received the most recent Billboard Touring Awardson's recognition of the \"best independent event planner\".
Montreal is facing the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator...
“Acquisition is one of the tasks entrusted by Montreali.
The mission is “politically difficult” because the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, opposes the shooting of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the “Terminator Governor ”
“We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which is the best location for us.
If you find that conditions are favourable in Montreal, you will go there.
It is our job to offer the best possible conditions to choose for us, says Schwarzenegger.
Fighting for Festivals
However, Denise Turcotte is now mainly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote more queberec films at all American film festivals, whether it be the Sundance Film Festival, whether the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'Âge des teenèbres received a positive reception for a few weeks at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January they will also be placed at the Palm Springs International Festival.
The Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
In addition, Quebec represented four short films and four film films at the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Is it the end of the year rally on the stock exchange? The expert's opinion is shared by the subprime-out
It's barely five weeks before the end of the financial year, the investors have already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to their normal year's end.
However, it is not clear to experts this year whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, in December, the stock exchange is generally positive.
However, only statistical back forecasts are not necessarily correct, and indeed, in the current situation, uncertainty is characteristic of the market, at least in the short term.
The experts do not agree with the end of the stock exchange year, although they state that “the stock market is maintained in the presence of liquidity, this is an opportunity to invest, as there are no guarantee alternatives, in particular fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the use of quality securities, as long as in the short term,”
They therefore believe that the stock will be characterised by either side-oriented or non-volatility-free movement, “mainly because it is not yet known to have the effect of cutting the Fed chamber, because the price of crude oil is also high and threatens to cause inflation.
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, i.e. he believes it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not common in roses, ”
The loss of Ibex is close to 4 per cent compared to the highest values registered on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945,7.
In spite of all this, not all experts are so glamorous.
Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 due to the reorganization of the wallets and payments to the usual pension fund at this time.
On the contrary, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the race will take place on the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitution.
The analyst considers that volatility is unlikely to affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, the Inversis Banco analyst, we are close to the technical level and are experiencing a decline in the stock exchange index, which may increase depending on the news from USA, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, the Intermoney, stresses that “this year, there is a line on the big securities.
The expert would include the two large banks and some construction companies on the list, which would make the electricity industry very expensive by then.
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
Rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if it is at all.
“ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this route, ” says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main element of the remaining part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies are also well-functioning, although representativeness in the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions have occurred in December.
The real end of the year was observed in 2003, when stock markets fell out of the crisis caused by the pain of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 28,17 percent returned, the jump was registered in December 6.68%.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth year of profit after each other (i.e. ibex will show an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally will occur.
Banco Popular Español opens an account open from 200 Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Español decided to renew most of his accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under Popular Max's name and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since this is the first group whose accounts are still open until 20.30 p.m., even on Saturdays from 10 o.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, the BBVA, which has also repeatedly said that its accounts were designed to open up longer, has not taken the necessary steps so far.
But she's recently made an agreement with trade unions that she'd close 75% of her accounts to open up one afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be of crucial importance to other institutions, since it will be decided on this basis whether they will join the initiative to support more favourable business opening.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In those places, I would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local shops.
The Bank wishes to operate its 200 accounts throughout Spain for 18 months with the already mentioned opening hours, because it is not a new opening order, but an existing conversion.
This institution modernises its accounts in commercial areas according to the needs of customers in each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new way of thinking about the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colourful design.
The responsibility of commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that there is no need for much investment to be reorganized, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
The accounts in which even the negotiators set up for SMEs are available will also sell non-financial products.
Positive Experiences
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrid accounts.
Angel Rivero says the experiences were positive.
The selection of accounts in the streets of Madridi Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía fell, and according to Rivero, the decision proved correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 accounts.
Another 60 works under the name Mundocred, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned in PopularMax, it is not the BBVA model where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We do not want to create competition for our customers, ” says Rivero.
They were able to reach agreement with Telefónica and sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antena 3 stock exchange value
\"We've done it.\"
By this sentence, he expressed his satisfaction at the end of the market yesterday, as Paolo Vasile, a consultant for Telecinco, when it turned out to have doubled the rival value of Antena 3.
Yet, one of the joys of his disciples was: “It is only the pain that this is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less, ” he said.
He also stressed the fact that the weak market had “beer than ever been. ”
Telecinco closed with a 2.54 percent increase yesterday.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
52 per cent of the company's Mediaset, 13 per cent of Vocento's, so the stock exchange value is EUR 4.488,88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
Her rival Antena lost 1.52 percent yesterday and she's got a 40.5 percent fall since January, so she's worth half yesterday, 2.193.46 million.
For Sogecable, the value of the other listed communication companies is 3.571 million; for Prisa (for Cinco Días) 2.518.53 million and for Vocento 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is known as the parallel between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can meet on the same market, at what costs, and how this is going to happen in terms of discretion.
The Telecinco announced last week that this year he wanted to be the first television channel of over 1 billion gross advertising, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publiespaña's advisor.
If the notified fact is achieved, the TV channel would increase its revenues by 3.6 per cent from advertising in the financial year 2006 to 965,4 million compared to this year’s financial year.
Antenna's 3 net sales increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (as achieved by 734.4 million), while the net television sales increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, Telecinco's stock exchange flow is one of the factors that led to its so far high pay out: in 2006, 100% of the profits of the company led by the President of Alejandro Echevarría were distributed between its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it would be too soon to decide, this ratio may change after 33% of Endemol’s mother’s company, including Mediaset.
“We guarantee a maximum of 50%, although we always share much more.
I hope that this year our shareholders will be satisfied with us because we have already benefited them with 33 percent of Endemol’s waters.
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some fall.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the yield estimates for Telecinco, up to 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
According to their statement, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in turnover in 2008 from 10,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % in 2009 to 5,1 % in 2009.
According to the same company’s forecasts, Antena 3’s profits in 2008 are down by 4.5 per cent and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 Opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high level of rentability and long-term sustainable potential of dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (selling) than Antena 3 (maintenance) due to the increase in the number of appeals and business activities.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, under-balance is proposed for \"similar risks\" (restricted market and adverse economic climate).
Congress approves the acquisition of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to Parliament's procedure, which has ended today with the Congress vote approving the changes to the Senate, the government has initiated social dialogue on the legislation that is based on the law so that both can enter into life before the end of the year.
Representatives of different groups have consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements, which served to develop the most favourable standard for investors and to regulate the activities of companies in order to function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, enables the modernisation of the financial markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Committee (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as to establish a new form of financial service (ESIS) with securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of implementing operations involving funds, thus contributing to regulated secondary markets, to multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems that compete with current stock exchange operators.
Furthermore, the Law obliges investment providers to keep records of all operations to facilitate market information on their business profiles, risk taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the control of CNMV.
A number of amendments were introduced by the Congress Economic Commission and it is of particular importance that the securities are treated as a \"complex\" instrument, due to the high risk to the investor, which was identified for US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive has also been used to legalise the scope of the activities of those with economic and business qualifications, which was 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Decree laying down the professional functions to be carried out by private operators only in 1977.
The Senate also proposed to create new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need CNMV authorisation and can sell products to several investors or obtain customers at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the European Union inflation rate, shows the evolution of Spanish prices for the month November.
Its disclosure is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of time and their nature.
The preliminary indicator number shall be used the same calculation method as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the assessment of information which is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary index is purely indicative and that it may therefore be different from the final data that will be made public on 14 December.
\"The Consumer Price Index continues to show relatively high value –
Pedro Solbes, a Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Economic Affairs stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only of an up-to-date nature, but, at the same time, it indicated that the price index would be expected to show a relatively high value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridor, Solbes confirmed that, although the indicator number is not very favourable, the rate of inflation in Spain remained more or less identical within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month in November brought “less surprises ” than the previous month, when the government did not account for such an increase.
We expected around 4 % of the value to be reported by the Minister for Economic Affairs during today's publication.
With Northern Rock, you want to get EUR 42 billion over the next three years.
Northern Rock's deposits fell by more than 50% and are currently only EUR 12 billion (16 billion 800 million) since it had been crisised in mid-September and had to raise urgent credit from the Hungarian National Bank.
Then he had a record of up to 25 billion pounds, the number of which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the fact that the government promised a 100 percent guarantee to the bank by the end of the crisis.
Virginia will operate this unit under her own financial, commercial name, under the name of Virginia Money, and will have to acquire about a quarter of the British banks' revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson's group of large-scale businessmen who have become known to the high-profile commercial campaigns in England is planning to spend some 50 million pounds (i.e. EUR 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to reach the stated goal.

The mayor of Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case
The College arrested the mayor of Totana, the town of Totana, in Murcia Province this morning, as it is suspected that he was involved in the urban corruption scandal that broke out this week.
Apart from that, they arrested one of the Secretarys of City Hall and the mayor of the settlement.
Former member of the town representative, José Martínez Andreo, took over Juan Morales, a representative of the People's Party in May, who, according to official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, was the head of the corruption network.
The police are still investigating the city's offices, as well as the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' attorney was also under investigation as the main suspect of a corruption scandal that took place this week.
According to the information from the SER radio station, the lawyer of Juan Morales of the People's Party was arrested when she left Morales in her bag with the corruption documentation.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the supposed commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galicia construction company for the reclassification of 200 acres of land.
There are now eight people in custody.
Bono will accept the PSOE candidate in Toledo and the parliamentary presidency if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, agreed to the Prime Minister of Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to run the PSOE list at the next parliamentary elections and to fill in Parliament's presidency if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference and by Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapatero in the federal centre of the party this morning.
The Prime Minister explained that “we must count with the best in politics, and Bono is“ among the best. ”
In addition, he added that ‘it is likely to be a manchai politician to appoint the Socialist Party to the President of Parliament if the Socialists win the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the place of the current President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to engage in the next elections and the political career, rather than fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister was constantly shopping to return to the political scene since two years ago with active politics.
He also added that since the voters were aware of who the Economic Vice-President would be in the event of socialist victory, the party would have wanted to inform them who would be President of Parliament.
If Bono really was to fill in the post, he would like to see Parliament, not the colour of insulting or yelling, and to be more like home for citizens.
“Seriously, this Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid where there is no peace to speak, the Prime Minister’s speech has already occurred 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he met the current President, Manuel Marín, for his “good work, ” but he did not want to state himself as president, not to consider his opponents to be “creating. ”
A campaign for the climate
Since the movement promoting climate change is unsatisfiedly pursuing both skeptical behaviors against its forecasts and those who prefer political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, he must bring with himself a political leader such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and declares that “we must make a new deal with our Earth. ”
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the government's activity or inactivity has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the heart of the Union's failure to comply with the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for not complying with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
In addition, it should clearly explain to Spain what measures it intends to take to contain climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, the ways in which the population needs to change, the energy saving at individual and social level, and the economic consequences of this?
So who has to make a sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not received any explanation, and we will not even be able to explain these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has led to measures, the actual measures are not always popular.
Both companies and the general public have a modest, comfortable and cost-effective way of doing so.
Even PSOE's gas price increase would have made it so unfavorable before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That Earth must be saved from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, with empty passwords free from real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new officers.
The agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, does not even build election meetings and wake us up with tenderness.

They arrested Mayor Totana and Head of Police for a suspected corruption case
The Department arrested the mayor of Totana in the Province of Murca, José Martínez Andreot of the People's Party, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a catering contractor for the crimes related to urban development, and today, police funds were informed.

The investigation will be carried out by a group of crimes committed at the Self-government level of the Operational Centre of the College, whose members have held eleven missions, in particular those related to the arrests, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Italy, one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, which could play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the biggest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of territory in Totana, which was reviewed. The project would have doubled the population of the population of the current 25 000 settlements.

Our Finnish scientist found this comment in one of Finland's largest journals: (i.e. the PISA report on the world's educational level), Helsinki Sanomat, referring to the criticism of Blackburn's book on 18 November.
“The philosophies became public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer, in the messages of a student before graduation, quoted the writings of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Educational Council, Pukka Elo, who was responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Platón's teachings with critical eye on the daily pages of the Helsinki Sanomat and added that Nietzsche's knowledge was not necessarily important at the compulsory basic philosophy of secondary schools.

One of his colleagues will inform us that the Penal Code contains a misdemeanor to download the Internet:
A. Download a music number is considered a misdemeanor and can be punished for a year from six months.
However, if you steal less than EUR 400 in a store, it is only a breach (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, theft is a sin, but the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty will still not reach the level of the penalty applicable for online downloads (Article 244.1).
D. You can count on a smaller punishment if you're into a fight than if you're copying CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you will receive a penalty from three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), but you will be punished for copying CDs for six months from two years
(Article 270 of the BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. Marketing of copyright-protected films to minors without the consent of authors is more punishable than selling pornography material to non-residents (Article 186).

My doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following address: “The money causes brain activity, especially if others have less “
So, the employee's feelings on the payday depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonni, using a tomograph measurement of magnetic resonants, and published in the last number of Science.
The author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Institute of Germany Neurokognation Group, Bernd Weber, said: “We measured the strongest activity when the participant replied correctly, but the partner made a mistake.
The researchers found that if they both had the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was reduced, but if one of them received double amounts, activity was also increased.
I don't know why such a great science needed to be so simple with a conconquer.
Governor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been hunting the Balkan war criminals in the Hague for eight years, and the Criminal Court for crimes in the area of former Yugoslavia.
His mandate is over at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter mouthpiece, as he is responsible for the srebrenica bloodshed, during which 8,000 bosnia musulmans were slaughtered, namely General Radko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnia and Herzegovina leader Radován Karajics are still out there.
Their names are on the list chosen by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach for his documentary: Carla's list (in Spain, 2006) and the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York, as soon as he tries to press on the governments concerned, so that the loop is needed around the refugees.
What kind of insurance is it for me?
Car insurance, which is a security for the owner of the car, is subject to a significant expenditure and is dependent on several factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining the licence, family status, type of car to be provided and type of use.
Getting a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often harder than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This Agreement is the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company assumes compensation in the head of the fixed insurance premium in the event of the damage.
The insurance fee is practically the amount paid for insurance, calculated by taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of acquisition of the licence, family status, type of car to be provided, use of it and others.
Insurance companies shall establish the insurance fee on the basis of statistics, i.e. pay a higher amount, representing a higher risk of accidents.
That's why they pay less than 25 years of age, or women pay less, as statistics show that they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people are also less likely to cause accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of the vehicle use type is crucial.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When establishing the insurance premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner must examine carefully to select the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the key factors for the choice in order to best adapt and establish acceptable prices to the needs offered.
When the insurance contract is concluded, the under 25-year-olds have to account for a number of backgrounds, such as lack of driving experience and updating of the licence.
Although it is most ideal if we are guaranteed any threat, there are more economical solutions.
The most cautious leaders can commit to a comprehensive insurance policy, thereby ensuring that they are safe against all risks, and the price will be affordable.
For such a type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
“The level of the part to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the part,” says Luis Noguera, head of the online insurance intermediary, First Europa in Spain.
Another option is the increased liability insurance for third parties when the client provides for damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be assured of theft, firecracker and car loss.
A good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as possible, because this affects the bonus and thus reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
It is called a bonus in comparison with the basic rates of the insurance company.
And the punishment for the basic tariff is called a ruse.
‘The level of bonus and malt depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has been a good year, it can allow you to increase the amount of bonus, explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year-old limit has been exceeded, owners will be easier to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience they have acquired over the years.
That's when we advise you to make full insurance.
“In Malta, young people are not yet able to use their experiences properly during an accident, even when they are driving,” says the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of management when the leaders have gone beyond the fears of the beginners.
If the insured is already married, but you do not have children, it is best to have a complete insurance policy, of course, if your financial options allow this.
Insurance companies keep children’s spouses for the lowest risk customers, so in their case the fee to be paid is lower.
In this case, the best part of the complete insurance (this can be worth EUR 300) or if they have a higher bonus may extend insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to others.
“They are more calmly driving, but they are larger and can allow themselves to be higher than yours, ” confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we offer a complete insurance (about EUR 150) or, in the case of higher bonuses, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it means a great deal of expenditure, so it is essential that we choose a properly adjusted form of insurance.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic are measuring the forces of the San Siro stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point at the end of the Champions League.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and they have already provided them with a tie to Portugal in the fifth round, but Celtic has nine points, but one more should be that the six-point Shakhtar, who is going to fight the four-point Benfica.
The D Group will be held two matches a week before the end of the sixth round, as the Milanan will have to play at the Club World Cup in Japan, where on 13th, he will try to fight the way forward to the 16th final.
This Group D will be closed sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the tieless, the two teams will aim to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and Celtic can first start from a better place in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team's defeat is enough to qualify themselves if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's a level playing field, the Ukrainians will get on who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scotlands, who would like to go into the eighth finals of the League of champions twice after receiving a goal from Kaka in the extension of 0-0 after the final season (1-0).
The “Rossonerik ” victory would be most pleased with Shakhtar, for if you lose Celtic into the eighth final and remain in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in the last place and having no chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still acquire the third place with a victory to play in the UEFA.
Twenty thousand people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert on the Spice Girls tour.
At Spice Girls Vancouver (Canada) they've started their tour before 20,000 viewers for the first time since they split up in 2000.
‘Posh Spice’ (Victoria Beckham), ‘Scary Spice’ (Melanie Brown), ‘Baby Spince’ (Emma Bunton), ‘Sporty Spince’ (Melanie Chisholm) and ‘Ginger Spice’ (Geri Halliwell) have announced that before the concert in the vancouveri GM Place that they are in the form of joint-rems’
Some 20,000 people have become tickets to be there at the concert, where they also presented a video film in the 1990s with huge successes on the history of the group.
In Spain, at the same time as the band’s composition and tour, the EMI also placed a new album on the market, on which the larger scalgers and two new songs are entitled “Headlines” and “Voodoo”.
The five members of Spike Girls entered the stage from the husband of Posh Spice, the British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was there at the GM Place juggle, although Victoria had been banned a few days earlier.
When the performance was overrun, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star had not yet seen our moving clothes, and then I was nervous about what he would think of the performance.
'Sporty Spice', was the reason that the band split up two years after he left the band in 1998, 'because the members did not understand each other'; he seemed nervous during the press conference that was held two hours before the concert.
\"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings that they felt about Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? Now I am glad that I decided to do so, Chisholm said about the band that broke up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that “in time things led and loved each other, ”
But there's been a lot of changes since the last part of Spike Girls took part in 1998.
According to CTV television reports, Virginia Airlines has arrived on a special plane in Vancouver.
There was a bunch of baby-sitters at the airport waiting for them.
They've got seven kids.
After the vancouveri concert, the team will take up California (USA) and then San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7.)
In Madrid, they will take action on 23 December.
More fears about the Russian-Ukraine gas boat
The gas sale between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel transport to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) will be transferred through Ukraine and the discussions between the two nations will always be given great attention.
Kinev stated that if Moscow increases the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also cover Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of an earlier debate between the two countries last year, supply to EU countries fell.
The most recent debate between Kiev and Moscow on the attempt of the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly, Gazprom, to pay Russia gas price in 2008.
Gazprom stated that, in the case of gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan, 50% increase should be made compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to the analysts, this shipment from Gazprom may represent an increase of 40% for Ukraine.
“It is important to argue during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important natural gas supplier states, ” said Anatolij Kinah Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs of Reuters.
\"The changes in gas prices should in any case be linked to our debate on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and West Europe)
As a result of the recent significant gas price of Moscow to Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas trap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly reduced prices.
One quarter of the EU's gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply was complemented by natural gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries.
The NHS obligation to monitor foreign workers –
The Scottish NHS committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body has been declared.
Robert Black, with the proposal, was the main auditor after a foreign national doctor in Scotland was brought into contact with the attack on the airport in Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate data on the number of employees overseas.
However, in its report, through five health authorities, it also pointed out key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following an attack on the airport in Glasgow, the main auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdulla, a doctor of Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jzsip moved to the main hall of the building.
Abdul was one of the three doctors who, in October, had been interviewed by the Old Bailey Court of Justice through video link, on the charge of a car bombing attempt in the United Kingdom.
In the case of NHS Committees from overseas countries, their staff should be checked before the start of employment, to be able to have the qualifications and experience of the workers concerned and to provide them with the necessary authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
While the Scottish Health Committees are applying the Disclosure Scotland in order to check the criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of Great Britain.
The main auditor's report has, among other things, proposed that committees introduce a guide to the Criminal Registration Office, which will facilitate the monitoring process with the various overseas countries.
“Even though we found evidence of such checks on staff records, they are not regularly implemented, ” says the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own examination procedure before employment at the same level, adding: “Our report highlights the potential areas of the system to be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas to sea.
According to Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, \"unusually impossible\" is that we can identify potential NHS employees who can carry out terrorist acts in the future through pre-employment checks.
According to the report, pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals has not yet been transparent.
According to the Scottish health authorities, in most of their doctors and nurses, the current number of their overseas staff is 1161.
However, the main auditor pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which can partly be explained by the fact that there is a problem with the identification of non-determinary staff on leave.
In the course of the investigation, it has also been shown that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, the district of Grampian, the Greater Glassgow and Clyde, the Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian have a high degree of coordination.
These procedures cover checks on passports, work permits and documents certifying professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Directive and guidelines on pre-employment checks for workers from NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon’s Health Secretary said: “I am delighted to see that this task has been achieved following an attack on the airport in Glasgow.
It added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for all employees, including those from overseas, is reflected in the best practical application.

In Saudi Arabia 208 people were arrested for terrorist conspiracy
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia announced that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, who were planning an upcoming attack against an oil plant, as well as the implementation of several attacks on churches and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells tried to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaida supporters launched a campaign against monarchy, which has been active since the 2003 Iraqi invasion as allies of the United States.
According to television reports, eight-person cells led by a foreign citizen are the target of an attack on an oil installation in the Eastern Province.
After an attack on the largest oil processing equipment in the world in Aqaiq in 2006 by Al Kaida, Saudi Arabia began to build a 35,000 rapid response force for the protection of facilities.
According to a report by the Minister of Home Affairs, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell that is carried by a person who is illegally crossing the national border to specialize in crackdowns.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
In 22 of the prisoners, plans were planned to commit war crimes against church leaders and security forces.
The government called for a tougher act to be taken by the church leaders to contain the Saludians joining the Al-Qaida warriors who are fighting the Allied Forces and the American-backed Sislim government.
The Al-Qaida warriors are considered to be a significant part of the Church leaders in Saudi Arabia, as the authorities involved in supporting the government's royal family policy.
Fighters of the organization - urged the leader of the Al-Qaida Saudi, Osama bin Laden, for the purpose of targeting the Western-friendly Saudi government - were targeted at attacks of foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“ Security forces have made enormous efforts over the last five months, ” said a spokesperson at the Ministry of Home Affairs on public television.
During the arrests, a 16-person media cell in Medina was also captured, with the aim of spreading “a tactical thinking. Takfiri thinking is an ideal for the Muslim radicals of the Sunnite, which supports violence against the infidel and believedant Muslims.
There were also 32 persons who were accused of financial support for the militants.
Venus's climate can provide an overview of Earth's future
According to scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide pleasant living conditions.
The data from a European circular spaceship suggest that this planet is more likely to be the Earth's sedentary twin brother than we believed earlier.
Venus is the nearest planet's wedding on Earth.
In terms of the size of the two planets, it's almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, more than a billion years ago, Venusnson could have ruled very similar living conditions to earth, and even residential relationships could have been given.
However, because of the extremely high carbon glass effect, the atmosphere erosion caused by sunlight and the lower rotation speed of the planet, Venus entered a very different developmental field.
Today, the water has sprung from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, as well as hurricanes and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express's space probe - based on a year's study of the planet - represent a sobering picture of how similar disastrous climate changes can develop on Earth as well.
Fred Taylor, Professor of Physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, reported: “Keep drawing why Venus’s climate is so much different from the experience on Earth, even though the two planets are otherwise very similar.
“The new data enabled the development of a scenario to be developed by Venus years ago, when it could have had housing conditions similar to that of Earth.
‘Studentled uranium’, seized by the police,
A kilo of radioactive material - according to reports - was occupied by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested, and three were also investigated.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was a depressed uranium, but stated that the material would have been sold for $1 million (480 000).
Open doors
According to Mitt Romney, a candidate for a presidential election is not worthy of answering questions from a snowman.
The Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters recorded and forwarded them to candidates for video.
None of the issues that were raised on Wednesday 28 November proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching the next year's elections.
For the time being, it is not known that the heads of production of CNN co-financed the debate were selected the YouTube clips submitted to candidates.
The longest issue facing the first half of the debate was immigration.
This is one of the Republican couples.
The CNN has requested some uncertain voters that, if they have heard something about it, they will dial a number: the intermediary has experienced an outstanding agreement when the candidates have made a strong statement on the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate between Rudy Giulian, who is at national level, and Iowa and New Hampshire, was between the progressive Romney.
Giulian is trying to change the image that, under the mayorship of New York, he has dealt with the issue of illegal immigration too easily.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former massusetts governor to build the house.
The dialogue between them became particularly intense when the questioners asked about the support of ‘amnesty’ (which would provide illegal immigrants with the possibility of permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter, California and Tom Tancredo, have been thoroughly integrated into the topic.
And although none of them count as equal on the label, they may have been explained by the fact that they started to collud the bells singing immigration sooner and more loud than others.
A broad consensus between candidates on the issue of immigration can be observed: a common goal of strengthening borders and of hard action against illegal immigrants.
This theme, as well as fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from the outside world, will help the Republicans within the Berkes to forget or minimise the division between the liberals and Christian conservatives.
On the other hand, when other topics were put forward, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giulian had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
Mr McCain and Mr Romney have argued on the question of whether the simulated water spilling should be considered torture.
Another questioner was interested in whether candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this question, Giulian finally got the view that although his favorite book looks at the Bible, he might not literally interpret the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
In contrast to expectations, Mike Huckabee, who was the first to acquire this election in Iowa, who was able to win the victory of a potentially Christian conservativeism, responded to the pain of the death penalty, but needed.
When they were asking whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed at Jesus ’ being wiser than to leave the elections.
Competition is still unusually open.
Huckabee's call for iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fund-raising mission and in the Wednesday debate with the enthusiasm to imitate him.
The sudden break-up of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet been able to set up a joint candidate among the aspirans representing more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who joined the party, who in time and convincingly fought the winning message of America's size and who found the common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has shared, and its consequences are still invisible.
Working Party Pains
Another gap ahead of Gordon Brown; the exit path is unaltered
Compared to British political scandals, the present does not seem to be too tight.
No one sold his honor, no politician ever had a hotel account in Paris, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
However, finding out that a rich businessman for more than four years has contributed to the Labour Party in Great Britain and that he did not report this party, one of the things that would have been well-informed by Gordon Brown without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when he said that public opinion polls had no influence on the outcome of the decision, he was thinking about the intellectual capacity of the British people, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and efficient government.
Instead, as Mr. Bean, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, mentioned at the time, was once terrified of Brown Stalin.
The misdemeanor to rescue Northern Rock has crossed the regulatory weaknesses and the lack of judgment.
The patient's proposals to change the tax law encouraged the business interest groups to come together with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authority is unforeseeable and has revealed a high degree of administrative incompetence.
In the House of Lords, three restless generals have given rise to protesting against the reduction of the military budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time occupation.
And here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (first administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments will be able to reach the point after which governance is inoperable.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but when a new group goes to power, they usually stop their infidelity.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is highly unlikely to be able to move things forward, and it may not remain on his post for a long time, the suspended infidelity is over: the civil servants' arm is beginning to leak, the office ministers will be instructed, the press will look after bad oral news, and the government will start defending and unable to focus.
In some respects, Brown is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he does not count as ‘ fresh blood’.
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was his right hand.
For example, the problems surrounding Northern Rock and the tax administrations are linked to decisions taken during Brown's Finance Department.
And even though it was not directly involved in Blair's misdemeanors, such as \"no money\", the investigation of the relationship between the case and political party funding, the voters' right to assume the opposite of this.
Although Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The attacks that have been committed are not as scary as those on the throats.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly from him.
And the compensation - whatever the pain is - can be created by the Brown resident Stalin: reliable, firm and slightly tough governance.
For example, it serves the coolness around political donation.
The garboan-celled Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to give his credit to the public.
Perhaps so, however, the decision was not his authority.
The law prohibiting the name of great political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks at the gates of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew about Abrahams' measure, however, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweaty during the interrogations; as Jon Medleson, the founding leader of the Labour Party, who was aware of the confusing donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, does not lead the fibres: there is no indication that he could have known about these coils, even that the huge sums were paid after Brown's entry into his office in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister's task has been half.
However, the violation by his party was quickly condemned, but it diluted his strength to reach a familiar device; he entrusted a retired bishop and a committee with the leadership of a judge in the investigation of the case, in order to protect the safety of the case.
In this story, the lesson to learn is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to take other things into account, such as the appointment of the President of the independent committee on administrative rules without leading six months ago or the effective reform of political co-financing.
This would require co-operation with the monitors from a hard hat worker party and breaking up with special financial relations associated with the associations - it would be a hard wall for the parhetal Brown.
But you're supposed to face some of the party-related scenes.
According to the surveys, the conservatives are currently leading a serious advantage; it has been two years for Brown to win the voters back behind himself; the only way to leverage the victory is uncontested integrity and strong competence.
Carrot sharks
Does the second market mortgage market crisis threaten America's credit card market?
If blood comes into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weak, predators focus on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage credit crisis is infected with other forms of retail credit, the loss of the credit card market can reach USD 99 billion.
The signs of tension are clear.
Both the ratio of outstanding loans increased by a description rate and by a default rate indicating the rate of late payments beyond 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of 1.4 billion dollars last month in the US consumption finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is still early.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3,89% by the Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is lower than the historical average by a complete percentage point.
The fall in these rates can be explained by some technical factors.
The change in the American rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden reduction in insolvency in the number of reporting agents, while a large loss on the credit card market has occurred; a renewed increase in the number of claims (and thus a description ratio) is expected, irrespective of whether or not the total amount of lending conditions deteriorated.
The rate of payment, which shows the rate of monthly credit repayment for consumers, is also strong on the market.
In addition, confidence in credit cards is quite strong despite the deterioration in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup research firm estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the crisis on the mortgage market are clear on the credit card market: consumers are raising debt on credit cards to delete housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers are mainly looking at cash flow and not asset value, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to a change in creditworthiness of creditors.
For creditors, the situation may be beneficial.
If the property is less than the mortgage credit value, it will reduce incentives for consumers to pay off credit; as a result, the repayment of debt on credit cards will take place in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexible to changing conditions compared to mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-allocation of assets.
“ One day we are likely to wake up to fully overestimate the loans, ” says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual fall is much more likely.
If the decline in housing market prices and the decline in lending are bringing America into recession, the industry is looking at the future of all doubtless.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers pleaded guilty in Enron
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were appointed to the court to investigate their role in fraud with the name of Andrew Faston, who were former financial director of Enron.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially found innocent in the charge of seven-order fraud, which is thought to be working with Fastow in a secret fraud in 2000, which their employer wanted to earn at the expense of their employer.
Your trial began in January.
But at a court hearing, the American District Judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted his guiltyness in the same order of fraud.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Greenwich NatWest became known during the two-year extradition procedure in Great Britain.
The closure of the investigation of the case initiated after Enron’s collapse in 2001 is still waiting for you in the United States.
First of all, he warned Fastow that he was one of his targets for a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers to the “NatWest Three” were accused of travelling to Houston in 2000, in order to prepare the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who is the better hand of Fastow and Michael Kopper, who is the better hand of Fastow.
Fastow, who is responsible for planning countless frauds in Enron, also held the Enron subsidiary in charge of which he invested Greenwich NatWest.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any existing shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men well knew that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's shares of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $25,000 to get a share in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow mist has informed Enron that the energy company is buying the 20 million-dollar subsidiary shares from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charges are held by the bankers at USD 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two-way guilt over the collapse of Enron.
The British third was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently punishing six years in a state federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a Texas prison.
The three English men in their heads could travel to the United States in the head of a $1 million bail, where they would stay during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company ever reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used for years have no longer been able to capture the millions accumulated as debt or the profitable but actually loss-making companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs disappeared, the market value decreased by over $60 billion, while pension funds decreased by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling last year, was convicted of their misfortune.
Skilling is currently in jail for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ceased with the death of the man last year.
No poverty in Moscow
At USD 54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine begins without interruption of the road between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount is only small for some Russian rich.
“18 passengers are in it, ” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“No one orders so many meetings because they buy machines for private families or corporate leaders, ”
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive, Milliomos Fair, held in the huge show hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury cigarettes supplier hired stand at the exhibition, it is hoped that the Russian novelists will be interested in all the yachts with the mahogany covering yachts up to 50 cents.
Mr. Firer was looking carefully at the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
“ A nice car, but our products are out of control, ” he said.
“Private aircraft are the largest market in Russia after the United States –
The Russian capital seems to swim in money as Dallas did in light at the time of the oil explosion.
“ We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered material here, ” said Marshall Goldman, the seunior scholarship of the Davis Centre of Harvard University Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Japanese gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and the 1990s, the Russians have now become the world's most spectacular poets.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold glass.
At a conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of the LVMH shared his opinion on how to sell high-value products on markets like Russia.
(The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes, there are 53 billion people in Russia who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second class reaches 103 thousand, who could have a total of $670 billion, has established a study conducted by the Public Administration of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed the personal well-being in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank data show that in 2005 the number of people living in Russia was 15.8 per cent.)
“ Several hundred million people live in Moscow, so we are all here, ” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole took part in the market for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are abused, and men are a real treasure mine, ”
In the rooms on Sunday night, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, each owned themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I try to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche, ” said young Yumatova, who was a bit of a rush in her unique design dress, as if he had been used to this drive.
The fair was arranged mainly for new owners, for brand-orientated Russian customers who are willing to spend several hours on the market, to go around a huty, Cifran decorated location where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum handkerchiefs, Mötkenpick ice cream, regular billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund gund gunks.
The ticket will be 30 euros for the average person (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians like to know what brands are the most expensive and best, ” said Mr Gijrath, who has taken into consideration the Dutch producer, Royal Delft’s stand, compared to a wall-sized, hand-made Rembrandt imitated for a blue exchange.
“The Russians, of course, are more interested in the things that seem to be happening, ”
Indeed, salesmen here said that for a long time (as the Russian stenders mean 10-15 years) the wealthy Russians have already agreed on brands made of poppy logos that would not enter a commercial fair.
However, thousands of people, including millionaires, trustees of millionaires and tourists, have spent their place all day suffocating.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil's beds, said that day he sold two sets of silk, cashmere and cotton made of gold thread.
Also, on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales agent of A1 Moto for the provision of modern alarms for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karaptian, the luxury car manufacturer, L.A. Connection president, sold three refrigerators for Sunday afternoon to Rolls-Royce Phantom. The bars are similar to connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
The reporters also presented a garden for the owner of the Russian casino, which Swarovski admitted with crystals to create the appearance of a Roulette wheel.
Price of a set of four: $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to have wheels made of struccas and a picture of his wife’s face from a circus stake will not necessarily use these items, ” Karaptian said.
“He will keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars, ”
Despite the fact that many of the Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says that the term “oros millionaires ” today does not represent a great privilege, bearing in mind the devastating rise in real estate prices there.
“The person who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is now most likely a millionaire, if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
\"There are more than you think \"
Those who are not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth before the studio of Alliance Continental Russian wealth management company.
The company has built four English-style telephones that have accumulated millions of fake dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, has printed 500 thousand fake bank notes on the Milliomos Buyer.
Many of the visitors stopped playing with money. Many of them made photographs of themselves by mobile phone as they were doing in the money ring, or they only put some millions in pocket.
“See, everyone in Moscow may feel like a millionaire, ” Karryev said.
They're suspected of having an accident in New Jersey.
On the day before Thanksgiving, it happened that Ronald Livingston looked out on a little healthier restaurant window and saw a rescue car stop at Cape Cod with two doors down at West Scott Avenue.
Sooner or later, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
“I then saw the doctor’s car stop, ” said Lord Livingston on Wednesday, one of the Inspectors working at the restaurant.
“ At that time I knew someone was dead, ”
The authorities learned that the dead woman was 41 years old, her name was Olga Arroyo.
The investigation is currently under way to find out if the death was caused by an intervention by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon working in West Scott Avenue under 212.
The authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they are hoping that the results of the toxicological tests that will be available in a few weeks will light this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to the high-ranking workers of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was often known in the department, has been an assistant police director since September 2006, with Garry F. McCarthy.
“ It was loyal, busy and reliable, ” said McCarthy Arroyo on a phone interview on Wednesday.
“ He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector.
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the former police officer at Nwark, he was currently married to Jimmy Arroyo, who was working in the Audit Committee on Seszkök Products, and he left two, 14 and 11-year-old boys and a stepmower.
Yesterday, the D.A. of the Union County District, the spokesperson of Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are working on investigating whether Mrs. Arroyo was a victim of unauthorized surgery.
“The probability is high, ” said Walsh.
\"The investigation is currently under way:
According to the authorities' reports, they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November.
The 21st and Arroyo were found on the couch.
They already declared him dead at the scene.
More than a week passed, and the police have told me very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about hearing Castro from the detectives.
Participants in the study are looking into whether part of the house is functional as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a fiery rosebo was standing in the front yard and a songless barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the basement, a blue canister was in the garage with the sign “Etil Vanilin” used to replace the vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Circumstances on two sheets of statin bike hanging on the side.
McCarthy reminded him that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York police station in New York, Mrs Arroyo gave him an inestimable help by helping him to settle his unusual and unscrupulous political culture in the new city.
“ He always said, ‘ It is better to be careful with it, ’ he remembered.
“Always he was here when I arrived in the morning, and he was still inside when I left the evening.
He was a pain in the ass.
The expectations of Fed's interest cut lead to a collapse in the world's stock markets
On both shores of the Atlantic Ocean, stock prices dropped yesterday after the reassured statements by the Deputy President of the Central Bank increased their hopes that the Fed will try to make investment easier by further cuts in interest.
The stock markets both in London and in New York and across Europe have turned to Donald Kohn, who is the better hand of the Fed President, Ben Bernanke, who has declared themselves “seriously and pragmaticly, ” to respond to the constant rest of the financial markets.
In addition to the clear purpose of Kohn's resuscitation in the middle of the signs of the rescheduling credit crisis, he stated that in the present dissatisfaction, he took back the development of the market at the end of September and October,
He said that if increased confusion persists, the possibility of further restrictions on households and companies' credit conditions could be increased.
The statements were interpreted by investors to allow Fed to invest fresh capital in US markets or even in additional interest reductions in order to stabilise the lending conditions.
The statements have also been restless on Wall Street, which has recently been reported by several bad news about the American economy, for example, a negative record of American housing sales.
The adverse reaction of financial unrest has also been confirmed by the announcement by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank that it will deliver 4 percent of 650 employees and 4 percent of its global labour force as part of cost reduction.
The total number of jobs in London, which employs 1500, concerns the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, by 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and thus increased the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 fonts.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Credit market anxiety has been renewed since the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank has not been seen in April 2001 at a price of 4.7% for European banks.
Following the interbank interest rate rate, Libor reached the highest level of 6,59% since September, the Bank of England was all under a higher pressure to follow Fed and the ECB and to allow additional capital to the London cash market.
In England, the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara is required
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's got the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in connection with the first test against Sri Lanka, it's no less important, who makes the decision?
On the other hand, the last question is current because David Graveney, the chairman of the pickers who temporarily performs this task, provides assistance to the leading coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughn in the decision. On the other hand, because the English managing director, Hugh Morris' desk, will begin to meet the national or at least one-time selectioner's post requests.
Among the two players pulls short, which does not get the sixth place, but as known, life and, above all, sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell what makes someone's calling at the top, while others can't get past a lower level.
It is not only the criticism that it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to make progress?
Is it fair for Shah if that happens?
The same question may be raised in other areas of life, for example, if we say John Edwards and “Tubby- Banerjee, two young leaders with smart, excellent qualifications, who are well-known business, would be put before decision makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell which level is a critic without throwing them into deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data affects decision-making very much, but they also have the same potential.
In a team, the player will have to catch the captain's look in the closet at the right moment, and a bat player will have to get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player once.
It's much more complicated to catch the sight of the pickers.
James Anderson, for example, has been better played in the past season, but he still thinks he's a certain team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison's own saying is in good shape and goes very well with him.
Anderson's 32 first-class gate shot and 33 runs to fight his participation on the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them had successful moments at the highest level and hope that they would be in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play in Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision can either trigger or break anyone's career, but it may also have no special impact on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played well on all the tests and played well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging back then, became an outstanding and decisive test critic, who may still be underestimated even today, despite having a double hundred points against Australia, the Australians.
It is likely that their discussion in Asgiriya Stanion during today's game will, listening to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughn and Moores, take place in addition to the increased experience of Shah, Bopara's young life and dynamics.
They both speak in favour of arguments.
The bright and successful debuting of the 88 bomby test is in addition to Shah, seven years younger, 22-year-old Bopara's sixos, who, by the way, also had an excellent screwdriver, reached 32 first-class hundreds.
However, the fact that Middlesex played a home in May, on the Lorda test, ran only ten in two quarters against West Indies, and the fact that Vaughn, who fought the next game, faced the immediate opposition of the electors, seems to have reduced the endurance that was still clearly visible to him in Bombay.
Compared to him, Essex's universal talent is a lifelong and infinite player.
There's nothing to be upset about on the crucet track, but he described his off-the-field behavior well when the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen, had a four-wheel.
Nevertheless, the first thing he did was to take Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call his teammate away from him, Alastair Cook to ask him, “You saw this. ”
Bopara is a better track-side player with better classes. For the sake of its tightened medium steps, it creates a preferential drum angle, and its punches are confident and effective.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the real art of choosing.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would offer an outstanding if - as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest - he's the one who plays this weekend.
They deliver the refugees home by bus to work and take up the fight with Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Georgia have arrived with the Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or lost their visa, or even those who hope the city has re-entered the order.
There are also those who have returned to fight those soldiers who have dragged them away from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan home before an 800-person bus charger from Damascus arrived in the government.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Bagdad, ” said Dr. Sabah al-Qubasis.
“I returned today because I saw what happened in Bagdad and that the city was safe now.
“ They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people, ” he added, referring to Moquda al-Sadr mililist, who has currently shut down his civilian army.
The 38-year-old ski teacher, Qassim al Atwani, who was mostly from the Sunnites, returned home with two children because he failed to renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from doing their job.
Amariai's ski neighbors called him and urged his return, saying that the troops supported by the Americans were able to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their mines in the western part of the capital.
One of the people from Jordan was a sunnita and skiiite tribe leader who fled from his home in northern Bagdadi Sleikh after he began to encourage his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
“My friends called me two days ago and told me that they had created an anti-Al Kaida militia in Sleikh and they needed support for me and my sons.
That is why I came back today, saying: “The 62 - year - old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many have been talking about the fact that, since the American troops were involved in the capital, the armed civilian forces who cooperated with the Americans have lured them home.
However, more have been forced to return from Damascus because of water and financial problems.
The 51-year-old Salam al-Samarrai voiced a wide range of refugees, according to which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki requested the Syrian government to reject the visa application for refugees to force their return.
They believe that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the death traps in the country.
“It was all right until Al-Maliki’s visit to Syria and did not put pressure on the government to stop issuing more visas for Iraqis in order to move home, ” said the Hungarian pensioner.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I ran away, ”
One of the reasons for the reduction of violence is that the sunnits have been expelled from the plains, while the skis have left the sunnite settlements, which is why tension is reduced in many areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will reinvent the fields that may lead to further battles.
Kis Saar-maa - Educational training
The smallest Federal Province plays a leading role in vocational education and higher education in international orientation.
Only one training area is being fought by island regions with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
“For 50th time, I explained to a non-Saarlander, that we are not French, ” I explained, on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in Saarland, which, based on the surveys carried out by the German Institute of Economics (IW), can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions, even because of traditions, are working closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
The students here can end their studies by today with a double or even three degrees.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students was 15.6 per cent.
However, many of them do not have high school degrees in the Saarland colleges and universities, even for those who want to study in the island region.
“In the Saar region, opportunities for vocational training are used,” explains Axl Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
Young people gain access to education at more than one fifth of their school, thus the Saarlands reach the federal average by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities for professional and higher education have also been well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is located in the second place in Germany in view of the number of populations.
However, despite practical training and increasing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Island has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign whose focus is engineering sciences.
“In primary schools, we initiated a number of reforms after the first Pisa study, ” said a spokesperson at the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has carried out country-wide comparative tests.
To start learning earlier, the last preschool year is free of charge. It is a model that the rest of the federal states started to climb.
To improve the performance of students permanently, only future comparative studies will respond.
Based on the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk has declined from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Saarland’s performance has not improved to as much as other federal states.
Bajorans count better.
The greatest revenge of the island regions during the Pisa phenomenon is not taken into account by the foreign language conscience - otherwise, they would otherwise be able to take beans in this area,
In view of the fact that the language of the neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the island regions are not French.
Chávez will change the clocks
In Venezuela, clocks are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will turn back timers in Latin America for half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez has become an object of laugh in Spain.
As told by Venezuela's official page, under a new law, the hours will be turned back four and a half hours compared to the time of the greenwichi.
In this way, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country of the world.
The United States of America has, among other things, justified its decision to force all-hour time zones to the world.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced that relations with neighbouring Colombia would be interrupted because of a hostage.
The Nationalist politician on the left stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian Government will be in contact.
“I cannot do this because of my dignity, ” said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform that should be delivered to the citizens of the oil country in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with the Colombian Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe’s decision to ‘arcule köpte’ Venezuela, expressed its criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new voice called “Por qué no te callas ” (Why don’t you keep your mouth shut), sounds like the sentence that more than half a million people have spent on the Internet.
The sentence comes from John Károly, the King of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin America Summit by the constant intervention of the populist politician in Baloldean, in this way in his word.
In 2007, wage reduction threatens the Germans
A real wage reduction is forecast to threaten German workers this year, despite strong conjuncture.
Experts have supported their pessimism forecast with gypsies.
In 2007, according to Hans-Bröckler, employees can actually account for less payments than in the previous year.
“The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in the general turnover tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices is due,” said Gustav Horn, the Institute for Macroeconomics and Connection Research.
Further burdens on workers may also be imposed on unemployment insurance.
Peer Steinbrück’s Minister of Finance stated in his statement to the ‘Neuee Osnabrücker Zeitung’ that the current situation is to reduce the right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Employment Agency should not be placed in a position to apply for credit or support to the Union, quoted the German Socialist Party, the SPD politician.
It became known on Tuesday that the flooding of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation over 13 years.
In an annual comparison, prices rose by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is the devil's twin brother of the Earth
Despite Venus’s sordid atmosphere, it is more similar to Earth than it has so far been assumed: in its atmosphere, the lightning flashes of the European “Venus Express” space probe, and in its corners, it discovered wind circles like those born on the Earth in the winter.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that Venus is lightning.
The European \"Venus Express\" space probe has discovered electromagnetic waves at the periphery of the atmosphere: The lightnings in Venus are round 56 kilometers [56 km] high from cloud to cloud, reports Christpher Russel on the branch of the science magazine.
According to the famous “great theory, ” the creation of Earth life was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, Zivatars started reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not like this: “If life was ever there, it could have been in very early times, ” explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is around a hundred times thicker than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
“Venus may have been the devil’s twin brother of the Earth, but still his twin brother, ” said Russel.
The main issue of sending Esa is why Venus is so similar in its mass and size on a different development path.
The “Venus Express ” was a milestone in the Venus Research in November 2005, for no probe since the early 1990s was on its way to find this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results already presented in the article “Nature” show not only the uniqueness of Venus Day.
“They also stress that the similarity of the neighboring planet is greater to the Earth than we expected it first, ” said Esa.
The researchers, along with the already known northern corner-breed, discovered a much faster rolling cloud on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds me of the air flows of the winter hay of the Earth, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second largest planet in the solar system is almost the same as the Earth and almost the size of the Earth with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The celestial body known as the Esthajnalillag will avoid the sun in just 225 days.
However, it is much slower to turn around its own axis: one old day lasts for 243 Earth days.
Although the temperature of the 460 Celsius-fosius surface with the pressure of Venus is hardly a reminder of Earth, scientists start by creating both planets in a completely similar environment.
Both of them gathered water that remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus left the universe.
And while carbon dioxide was tied to carbon dioxide on Earth, Venuszon is a large part of this atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, the German President of the Republic is calling for the end of the dispute between the parties that was set up at the office of the Dalai Lama.
In the meantime, he criticised SPD for attacking the Chancellor after September.
Horst Köhler, German President of the Republic, is concerned about the German authority and has called for the great coalition to complete the debate on the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this matter, we should not be a divided nation to the outside world, ” said Köhler to Handelsblatt.
Köhler also expressed his understanding of the acceptance of the Dalai Lama by the Chancellor of Angela Merkel (CDU).
“I have human rights universally applied to me even if I respect the diversity between cultures, ” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany has to take care of the external policy balance, stressed the President of the Republic; however, Merkel has protected the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
\"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional Chinese policy.
China is also aware of this,” said Köhler.
Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD) indirectly, expressed his rejection over the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target sign of attacks in the Union.
Steinmeier complained, inter alia, about the EU's policy on foreign policy.
Following the acceptance of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, there were severe disturbances in the German-China relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership did not only return to the invitation of the German Minister for Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL's information, frozen the so-called Strategic Party between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
Mr Wen Jiabao's head of state has just called on Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the fact that European politicians accept the religious leader of Tibetans in their official quality strengthened the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that he is trying to break further Tibetan territories from China, including Tibet and other provinces today.
Schäuble is protecting you against disturbances similar to those of France.
Street collisions with the police, shots, flame cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not interfere with street violence, the Federal Minister of Interior requires it.
Barricades flamed, randomly shot at police officers with beer rifles: After serious disturbances of young people in France, the Federal Minister of Interior (CDU) is concerned with similar developments in Germany.
“We need to be pleased that social explosives should not be accumulated at our disposal and not be forced into violence.
We must take this seriously, ” said the newspaper “Neue Presse ” in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Associations, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problems, said Schauble.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
\"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes have already been achieved:
However, it is still too early to clear the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and socio-economic problems in the German suburbs, such as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people fought serious street battles with the police.
Cars and public buildings also flamed in Toulouse.
In view of this, the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat, the head of the German Turkish Communities, called for greater activity in the area of integration.
With regard to the disruptions in France, Kolat warned about the dangers of follow-up.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Colat indicated that among young people under 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate was \"higher than the average\".
There should be more education than ever.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give a vision for young people –
However, the Head of the Turkish Community added that “social supervision within the family is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Colat warns: “In spite of this, we have to be sharp. ”
Young people should be given the opportunity to work and receive education more quickly.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, the night was completely restless.
Hundreds of officers were ready to be deployed, and a helicopter with a beam of light was going through the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests, as well as some flaming trash and car.
Since the reporting, a round security unit of 1,000 people has provided peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as it is necessary, announced by Michelle Alliot-Marie Minister of Interior after his visit to the city.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 policemen were wounded.
The next night, the disturbances spread to Toulouse.
In the event of a traffic accident, the earthquakes were caused by two young people who lost their lives on Sundays.
According to the first findings of the State Attorney's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Uprising in Angela's empire
The act of the Chancellor’s reality is proof that the coalition is at the end of it - and nothing is expected from him.
In which country is the Federal Chancellor?
Following the general debate of the Bundestag, it is necessary to establish, in terms of its content, an act of public interest and nothing: not here - he does not live in the country whose governance would be his business.
He rejected the accusation with Angela Merkel, with a very generous sentence, that he would be too focused on foreign policy.
That's a provincial, she answered, and in this way she just said she didn't want to understand what her critics were talking about.
At the Federal Collection, he made it clear to all of us how inventive we are.
Meanwhile, neither particular interest nor empathy could be felt at the problems of the country.
Instead, Mrs Angela, a High Commissioner, who is a reality-ridden politician who is running to foreign policy and there is only uncertainty of his own.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendamm welcomes himself without delay, but he listens to how the goals of climatisation should be achieved in the country.
In any case, as far as self-respect is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years earlier.
Now he's getting into the frescia that the prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This caused the damage to the good news as a pragmatic person, who, instead of talking flowers, offers solutions to problems.
However, the empire of the clouding Angela is only ancillary to domestic policy issues.
Child poverty and low income problems?
It only feeds on a few half words.
There is a great deal about how often it takes to break language when it comes to family replacements.
You have to get Merkel up three times to put together a sentence half as long as you can.
If you're talking about specifics, you're outlawing in a foreign area.
I.A.'s Department of Investigation
The Republican presidential candidates in the debate on Youtube have also had a hard turn between the two Favores, Rudy Giulian and Mitt Romney, and they must also be held from an outside candidate.
The tensions of candidates have already surfaced on the first topic.
What Romney brings up to the opponent, Rudy Giulian, made New York a “deal for immigrants. ”
Anyone who shares serious facts on his own: “I would say that his own house was a shelter for illegal immigrants, ” cut back to Giuliani, and throws it into the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts, who did not employ immigrants with documents as a private person.
As the Republican camp does not yet have a single supported favorit, the eight presidents use the debate on CNN to undermine the opponent's loan before all.
The 30-second video sent by Internet users via Youtube is only more than short summaries.
“We have brought Hitler to power with this type of Isolacionism, ” drooling John McCain under his opponent Ron Paul’s nose, who demands the immediate withdrawal from Iraq as one of the participants in the circle.
Romney also thoroughly washes the head of Vietnam’s veteran when he is tempted to torture the so-called \"Waterboarding\", the method of interrogation in which the water is shattered.
The important topics of the campaign, however, are just over-represented in the debates on Iraq and torture, are the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Sound taps break out in the room at the rejection of conservative values and future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more evident.
“ I was wrong at the time, ” says Romney, “and apologize to the supporters and television viewers for putting the sausage down in 1994 at the end of the pregnancy.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is eager to ask for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first to rule as a civilian.
One day after his return from the army's head, there was a fall in power in Pakistan as President Musharraf.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, it took Mr Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television from the capital, from the President's Palace of Islam, sent the ceremony live.
Musharraf swore on the Constitution and that his people would do well.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus released international pressure from the United States.
After eight years of the former General's reign without bloodshed, in the form of a military rifle, he is now in the first instance a civilian Head of State.
Musharraf, acting as chief commander of armed forces, has complied with a fundamental demand for the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the abolition of the exceptional condition announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Major Malik Muhammad Qayum, Musharraf will stop the extraordinary state of the West shortly after his fall.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, at the beginning of November following the release of the extraordinary state, has set up sympathizing lawyers with him, has rejected all kinds of protests last week regarding the re-election of the Head of State of State of 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured due to an attack against a military guard in the North-West.
According to the information reported by the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghan border.
Fathers of the crater will return
He's replaying the German super team in the '70s: Harmonia's three gang members have resembling her instrument until a concert in Berlin.
At the time of their reconciliation, a cut appears from the time of “Live 1974. ”
They were already more well-known abroad at that time.
The notified sensation was carried out by three agreed gentlemen surrounding the dinner table.
Before all, your own instrument, your cable and your own buttons before all.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a snow white shirt with 63 years of his own.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is young in 57, is accompanying a laptop and guitar.
From the audience to the right, your 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curve and focus on the console.
All of them are producing some kind of noise, and once again, they're making rhythms.
And all of this sometimes comes together as a traditional music.
However, all of this does seem to disturb the lords in no particular way.
It was a great excitement for those who liked Krautrock's music management to replay Harmonia's band.
What we can tell you here is that, as a result of the proper follow-up, the name has fallen through the collective pop memory, but in no case left any permanent clues to the pain of this band after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
In particular, what we call a misguided crane has always been appreciated more in England and America than in his own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the living members of the Kölni Can group in 2003, the figure of the German pop was sitting in the room with an inexplicable face.
When he even thanked the La Dusseldorf and the Neu! bands in the Red Hot Chili Peppers presentation, the wonders became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Roth sat on the stage as an old buddy of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Home rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
Harmonia is the only reason that the memory is overloaded because the trio was only in existence for two years, and during this time it was far less effective than others subsequently attributed it.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play along with Conrad Schnitzler in the name of the promising Cluster.
At first, they played in a basement under Schaubühne, Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company financed by the church.
Roth will be helping the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, it may be the most radical German band, the Neu! guitar player, he got a reputation for himself.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster’s musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th - century novel lived as a comedian from the city.
Less ideologically than in the I. commune where Roedelius was still in trouble as a babysitter.
They're more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein was from the garbage and they found a name for their art in this way.
Some things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The title of the first album is ‘Musik von Harmonia’ and ‘De Luxe’
Despite his cool and modest music, the band had a financial need.
The stock collection alone did not guarantee their own discovery.
The CD displayed in the address ‘Live 1974’ was taken up at a concert in Grissem, in front of a small 50-person record number audience, so someone remembers.
Harmonia was an idea at that time, and it was Roth's idea to use it at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The band announced its distribution in 1975.
Roth was tied up with his thousands and held up from albums like \"Flammende Herzen\"
Cluster was relived in the eightties, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
Thanks to the live album Herbert Grönemeyer in Florence.
Her record company, Greenland, aimed at caring for the krautrock as a special German tribute to its living music.
In this context, Neu! has already been produced as well as that of Roedelius.
Harmonia's resurrection will take place at the House of Cultures in Berlin.
In public money, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British ancestor and the book Krautrock Sammler.
There's also the idear for Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
This is about surrounding the effects of clautrock on the follow-up popzeni era.
In this respect, Harmony fills out the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno, together with the most unusual voices, is floating in the room: “The only true music, his future,
There are pictures of the producer in a farm room with Harmonia.
The drawing of additional black and white photographs of the equipment with cabled exhaust serves as a legend.
In the front, the three veterans are again absorbed by improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are recorded for the organ and drum assembly with the intention that the musical instruments themselves have not yet heard sound effects by means of means that produce sound effects.
Today, electrical music looks like electrical music.
Three, tech-scrazy barricades.
Even the household doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's leadership, they cough and kiss, and in a beautiful part they sing “Aaaaaaah”.
The crater has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in the music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here “'68” is crying out, it does not go completely wrong, and Harmony is not yet left to settle himself out of rest.
They're even considering the most obvious thing on stage.
Where does the music start, and where does it end?
This may be a matter of nerves to keep the man alive, or to give him a gift with the passing moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere simply isn't quite cynical
Two films are once again involved in the Balkans war by means of “Walking and Mörderischer Frieden”.
But none of them are convincing.
The idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help us with this.
First of all, the good news: While the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan Mountains, they found him again in the dark back of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Richard Gere.
In recent times, we have seen the most beautiful man in the 1980s, as many good-boy-sexing roles in women's emotional films and many press conferences on Buddhism have even taken our pleasure in seeing it.
And here all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most serious argument that we might still be looking at the movie “Warth, ” c.
It's a wonderful, entertaining design: Based on what he created, Simon Hunt's warden could have become if the fate and film industry were not so graceful: a man who left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline as a corrupt monument was still a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the production of “Mörderischer Frieden” in German and also started this week, despite this fact, only the endless series of broken films on the Balkans war.
The film “Mörderischer Frieden ” does not need much to be wasted: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from Kosovo, and one of them suddenly loves her.
Although welcome is that once the Serbs are described as all bad single causes, the film carrying the vulnerability of television films is too quickly removed in shooting and eventous scenes.
\"Cobra has 11-marks - instead of a highway with war.
On the other hand, it is an example of why not even a really good movie of the Balkans was ever made.
The three United States warden stories, who gather to explore the “Róka” Serbian war criminal, other director, other scriptwriters (both Richard Shepard's personal union) in a different age, might have become a new “Apocalypsis now”.
For the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases small groups cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases the journey to madness is going on.
One of the reasons for his failure is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be a cynicist who is listening to his heart as it is at the beginning.
No, and as part of the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a woman who was murdered later.
The “Warth, ” the reporters are going to slip away in the last five minutes of the film, when they reach what NATO, CIA, and all the world’s main hunters have been unable to catch a war criminal and then hand him over to the Mohamedan witches for fair revenge.
It's so bad that you want to go to the Hague International Tribunal for a crime against the logic of the cinema.
But the aim of the film is deeply human.
He's trying to stop the field by saying that Karajics and Mladics are still out there and suspects the Americans and the French (which are supposed to be exceptionally united) that because of secret political deals, persecution is not being sufficiently intensively pursued.
But sometimes good and evil are so much like each other that a famous Brecht-verse comes to mind.
This poet writes of the Asian demon on his desk: “I will be staring at the dylantics of the dylantic city, which will tell us what it is to be bad. ”
Films such as “Warning, ” have the same oversized, human-headed masks, but they show what it is like to be good.
This problem is not limited to the art of films on the Balkans war.
Recently, they reported in the paper that all the Hollywood movies on Iraq were a mess.
You can add: There's not yet any good films on South Africa.
It is almost always valid: If a star wanders around the world’s crisis holes or mine fields, it will be as if it is shattered like “In the paths of freedom, with Patricia Arquette, without Hatars, with Angelina Jolie, or with the “Verous diamond, ” Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are still too close to time.
For decades, Hollywood was able to film a good film of holocaust with the “Schindler List. ”
Some films are likely to be - since the works of the Vietnamese war, such as the deer hunter, the “Apocalypse now, ” or “Full Metal Jackett, ” were not celebrated as a masterpiece in their own time.
But it is possible that today, when every mass murder comes in real time, right now, through two screens in our home, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that's gonna dispel script writers from ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell good stories.
In fact, Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to put the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in his sarcastically distant artistic vision.
When “The historical novel between Lemprière’slexicon ” and the parallels between the Balkans, he replied: “It only depends that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be so dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.
Von Beusto is being criticised for the withdrawal of the Olympics.
The mayor's decision to settle the Olympic Games in Hamburg in the summer was a strong criticism of political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for the arrangement of water games.
However, Von Beust is strongly warned about the realities during the probabilities.
On Wednesday, the Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal to be negative for the economic environment.
None of the other projects have recently released such huge motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
\"With this objective, we cannot maintain a level playing field in the field of sport policy:
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative, which will start from amended time coordinates:
Besides his earlier statements, Mayor von Beust said that the ambitions of Hamburg's Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
“It is not Hamburg to decide on the Olympics competition, but the German Olympic Sports Association,” said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He welcomed the decision of the Sport Association at the beginning of December on the München tender submitted to the Olympic Games in winter 2018.
“The preference for this means that we will not have real opportunities in the period up to 2028 that we have been thinking about.
However, we do not give up the dream, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sport Association (HB) expressed its regret over the statements made by Beust.
This impression is that Hamburg does not intend to apply for Olympic games for the next 25 years.
“It is too early to throw away an opportunity to bury our plans, ” said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
The withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement of the President of the Senate at the reception of the General German College Sports Association.
Since Von Beust Hamburg, the 2015 Universiadéra submitted a tender that is not a supplement to the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association has only launched Hamburg as a participating city in the competition last week.
The Civil Group of the SPD has taken up the Senate that it has left valuable time in terms of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been slowing down for years since the Senate because of the fact that the Olympics were colluded and the construction of the dwelling, ” said two SPDs, Carola Veit, and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has consistently broken its lead alongside an integrated plan for the Olympics and later home use for Kleiner Grasbrook, CDU unilaterally focused on the ‘event factor’.
The 2012 Nyár Olympic Games competition was at the time of its great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg Lipcs has failed.
They're not Warhol's flames.
The one who connects the Swedish and wall concepts to each other is Ikea, and he doesn't mean Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
There are currently walls manufactured in Sweden that place a dark shadow on the list of the works of Warhol.
This is the ninety-four-type Stockholm type – Brillo Box is a large part of a fake.
After a few months of questioning the originality of Andy Warhol's Brillo's boxes in 1968, the internal investigation of Stockholmi Moderna Museet has now resulted in a sobering result: In 1995, the former museum director Pontus Hultén, the six-Brillo Box, which was donated to Moderna Museet, and most likely a round of hundreds of additional \"Stockholm-types\" – Brillo Boxs.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and casserole performances.
Warhol, New York, in 1964, created the first “Brillo Box” – painted walls based on red-and-white-white cardboard for the “Brillo - soap powder. ”
The hundreds of the Brilllo bridges from Warhol, which were made out of cardboard, were not from Warhol for reasons of cost savings, but were transported directly from the Brilllo Carton plant.
It wasn't about art, it was about their template, it was about simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission to produce some of the Brilllo-falades in Sweden, which were not produced in Moderna Museet in 1968.
The witnesses of the age are now speaking on a round of fifteen boxes which, as a certified Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, have been admitted to the art and auction history under the designation of Stockholm.
Some of them were dumped for over $100 000.
However, the problem is that Pontus Hultén, director of the legendary museum later on, wrongly claimed that in 1968, a round hundred walls were manufactured and produced in Sweden, which was then left to Warhol.
In fact, the 105 cases of Hultén were manufactured in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petervár.
However, at this time Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main monument of Moderna Museet, examined three boxes in private owned by Sweden next to the six Brillo Box of the museum, of which two boxes were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pre-egged filmboards were first squeezed and squeezed, followed by an ecquencing of white oil paint.
In contrast to the structure of the copies from 1990, it is reported that the paint was brought up directly on the screen, not even on oil, but on acrolfes.
“These boxes are not authenticated by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes,” says Lars Nitve, Director of Moderna Museet: “If it is not decided otherwise by New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board', the Moderna Museet will be classified as a copy/representation material in its collection.
Of course, the Authentication Board has already announced in June that it is examining the “serious accusations” regarding soap dust boxes.
However, ever since then, they are putting me in an inconvenient silence.
The rebels in Manila are giving up.
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines, the soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila, and called for the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
You can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, you have reported to reporters at the hotel leaders, Antonio Trillane, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, government-collar soldiers who took a tear gas hit the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricaded in the building for hours.
Half of the team stood before the court on Thursday because of the failed push attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to get him into the wheel suddenly with 30 sympathisms.
The military police tasked with the man's guard has obviously moved on to join him and join him in the preaching process.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel, and then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was called upon.
Government units have closed down the area of the pre-smoking hotel.
The president called the security office for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales was convicted of the military procedure.
“ They have enough money for people, ” Trillnes said.
“We call on people to join us.
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the Scout Rangers elite, declared that other military units wanted to join the process in a short time.
By Friday, government judges called for strong protest against the president.
His government has been covered by corruption charges for several months.
The financial district of Manila was already the main stage in 2003 for the army's training attempt against Arroyo, organised by 200 members.
The uprising failed only 24 hours ago, when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven rifles in the Philippines against the newly elected governments.
United Internet will be big-time in Versatel
The United Internet provided more than 20% shares in Versatel's telecommunications company.
