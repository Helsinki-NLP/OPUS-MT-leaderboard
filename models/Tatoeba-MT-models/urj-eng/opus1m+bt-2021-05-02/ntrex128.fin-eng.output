Members of Wales are afraid to look stupid.
Some Members of the delegation have been confused with the proposal to change their title to MWP, namely Mr Wales (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu started with a plan to turn the representative's name into the Wales Parliament.
The Members of the Parliament are concerned, regardless of the party, that the change may make them look ridiculed.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned about the fact that the name is different with the words Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupidity, and pwp means cocoa.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is not satisfied and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the conservative party, his group is in favour of a change of name, but points out that the MWP word is a short word of words for stupidity.
In Wales, the W-book is said to be similar to that in the English language.
The Commission, which is currently drawing up the legislative amendment required for the name change, stated: “The final decision on the headings representing the members of the representative shall, of course, be for the members themselves.
The Wales Management Act 2017 gives the representative the authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals saying that the appointment of the delegation to the Wales Parliament enjoys broad support.
The Commission recommended that the Members of the Parliament of Wales be represented or reduced to WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
The Members of the Parliament are apparently proposing alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to a major shift in President Elin Jones, who are expected to have a legislative proposal for changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments contains other changes to the activities of the representative, such as the loss of the representative's action and the rules on the format of the committee system.
In the course of the legislative procedure, the Members of the Assembly may give their final vote on what heading they should be called.
The Macedonians go to the electoral council in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote on whether the country's name will be changed to the Republic of Pohjois-Maedonia.
The referendum is aimed at solving the conflict with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the Northern Neighbourhood is in practice a territorial requirement of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU- NATO membership efforts.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, has said that he has ignored the vote.
However, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, the supporters of the referendum reason that change in name is simply the price of EU membership and NATO membership.
St. Martins' bells are going to shut down when the halls of Harlem live in difficult times
\"The people I've been talking to said that before every street corner there was a bar or a church,\" Adams says.
- There's no one here.
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, \"The people's interaction has changed.\"
\"The bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighbourhood, where people are meeting regularly.
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the sale of assets is not as far as the leaders imagine, and sooner or later they have returned to the departure box.
He added that churches could be replaced with residential houses and apartments that are inhabited by people are not those who would support the saints left behind.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white, ” he says, “and thus they will be forced to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these rooms will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlemist became a black settlement - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original White Methodist Society moved away in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th Street traffickers of Harlem's main trading street against their opposition to the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939 the fire was badly damaged by the building. When Father Johnson’s congregations designed to rebuild, they introduced a tower watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, called the tower watch proudly...
In July, an expert called it: \"cultural treasure - and - irreparable historical instrument\" -
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first tower watch game played by a black musician in the world. It was Dionio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower watch game in Riverside, 18 years ago.
According to Meriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, in recent months, a complex mill has developed, involving architects and contractors hired by the church leaders and the episcopal stripe.
The congregation’s governing body, composed of governors, wrote to the hiippus in July, its concern that the circadians would try to take the costs to the saw, even though the saw was not involved in the hire of architects and contractors sent by the hiippee.
Some congregations complained about lack of transparency in the case of the circadian.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old hummer in California.
The authorities tell us that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him in his dive of lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach just before 7am in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel told me first that he thought that he was just excited when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that he shouted, \"I was bitten.
I'm bitten!
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole syllable had been torn open.
“I asked everyone to leave the water: there is a shark in the water,” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the shark attacked is unknown.
In the media event, my lifeguard captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed the beaches from the Ponto Beach of Casablanca to the Ecinitas Swaziland for 48 hours for scientific and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan is for the United Kingdom's beauty care institution
Sainsbury's sues Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in commercially-friendly beauty care departments serving expert advisors.
This is a major movement for the United Kingdom's 2.8% billion beauty care provider, which continues to grow, even though the sale of fashion and home resources will deteriorate. Larger beauty care departments will be tried in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to other stores next year.
Beauty products are located because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and home resources.
Sainsbury's tells the beauty care product range of 3 000 products that are doubled for the first time with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
Supermarket is also rescheduling its Boutique make-up range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is using rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first one was opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the other one is opened in Sally Oak Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food purchases to small buying-in shops make supermarkets come up with new incentives for customers.
The CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that the stores are going to look even more from the supermarkets when the supermarket chain is fighting against cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidlin by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened up hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also the Habit stores.
Supermarket failed in its previous company to renew its beauty care and pharmacies.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the cooperation ended with a dispute on how to distribute the profits of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows a business trade where Sainsbury's sales 281 were sold to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, with a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told Lloyds that he was part of a plan to expand the four shops on signs such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in workers who have received special training, who are willing to advise customers.
Our range of brands responds to all our needs and attractive environment, as well as our convenient location make us a convincing shopping destination for beauty care that challenges the traditional way of doing shopping.
Peter Jones's ship, after Holly Willoughby's 11 million pounds contract.
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, left in his ship when TV pilot Holly Willoughby retired from a 11 million pounds contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home appliances and costume brand Truly.
Two companies have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old runner of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was able to take the Dragons Den star Peter Jones away from their productive lifestyle business at the last minute. He is now going to focus on his new big-time contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones had been on his tracks, last Tuesday at a tense meeting held at the Jones headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshir. The stargirl had admitted that his new $1.5 million worth of money would not give enough time to their home appliances and residential brand Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was cut off by the double Willoughby's estimated 11 million pounds of property.
In his 37-year-old Willoughby reported Instagram leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain into one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was the most important project in Holly’s life.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everything to be astonished as possible.
No one had faith in Tuesday's events so close to the publication.
Marlow's main office has a warehouse full of items to store.
This Morning is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and according to experts, one million losses can be caused by the company’s departure due to product investments, which include all the pillows and clothing for home supplies, not to mention the delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her mate Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and this wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby organised Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples holiday together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be cut off from the new brand ambassador of M&S and replaced by Ant McPartlin ITV, I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones said last night, \"We do not comment on his business...
A little talk and then we fell in love
He joked on the criticism that he would get in the media about his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the President, as well as his support for the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he pretended to be a newsman.
I didn't give up at all.
He pointed out Kim’s interest in seeing again after Trump’s first meeting in July was a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear isolation.
However, nuclear negotiations have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's high-level diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North is not seeing a similar reaction from the United States - to the early armed activities of North Korea.
On the other hand, he said that the United States would continue its sanctions for which pressure was to be maintained.
Trump had a much more optimistic vision in his speech.
\"The North Korea is doing an excellent job,\" he said.
We were driving into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship...
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been completed, the hostages have been delivered to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relations with Kim.
“It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10 000 more out of this spot, we would have about 200 people standing right there, Trump said, by showing the audience in front of it.
Indonesia's tsunami and strike destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteers reported that they were not needed.
The national emergency for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's inhabitants had remained homeless.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging,” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a Palu travel group, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the notifier of the National Disaster Agency, said that the authorities of Indonesia are assessing Please see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia continues to be unfortunately prepared to meet the forces of nature, taking into account repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although Acehiin has been built into tsunami salts, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely to have lost lives because of the tsunami alert, even though the warning was in force.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it lasts at least three days before it reaches a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia at the centre of his electoral campaign, and he has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a financial gap in the management of the river, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have been fighting street fighting with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has resulted in more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.

The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect after finding a woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead at Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all those in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all the cab drivers who may have recorded something on the computer board video, to contact the police, and they may have vital information from the point of view of the investigation.
The police informant has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has become known to a woman who has asked about her location.
As the investigation continues, the police are telling us that they are trying to inform the victim of what happened.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The inhabitants have just learned that you can go for hours before they're allowed back in.
One officer was told that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A teary woman showed up at the scene.
He repeated saying, \"It's terrible.\"
There were two Mays in the area isolated two afternoons, and also a third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who controlled the floor.

Mr Cromwell-patsaki was involved in the reconstruction of history.
It would be a poetic right to leave a statue, given that his own fanatical puritanists destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Taliban.
The Cromwell Seura described, however, Crick's proposal for a \"typerydea\" and \"historic rescription\".
John Goldsmith, President of Cromell-sura, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a goalboard of Oliver Cromwell’s statue on behalf of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command and did not implement the iconoques of the civil wars in England.
False Cromwell might have to suffer from the work of his former ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell reflects the opinions of the 18th century, and it is historical evidence of a character that many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Monet, although perhaps more in the 1800s than today, Cromwell, as a defender of this House, is against the external pressure that, of course, was caused by monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the 16th century conflict has mutated the later development of our nation. Cromwell, on the other hand, must be identified by a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a government nurse deserve thanks and remembering.
The killer shatters the Chinese farmer's death
The local media tell us that the pig attacked the farmer and killed it on the market in Lounais-China.
Only by his last name, “Yuan, ” he was found dead near the pigs’ market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. The master of the man had broken down, and he was covered in the blood, South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
The Sikopaime is preparing to vaccinated pigs in the pig pigland on 30 May 2005 in the province of Qinghai in China.
He was newsed with his cousin from the nearby Yunna County on Wednesday with a view to selling 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning.
In a pig, he said he saw a big scream whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal technical investigation confirmed the death of a 250-pound career farmer.
My Guiyang Eventing News magazine says: “The cousin of Wu – said that my cousin’s feet were bloody and confounded.
The surveillance camera photo shows the cousin arriving on the tower to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The man's killed pig didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the tower told the Eventing News that the pig had been locked behind the locks so that it would not harm other police in gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the thories are reported to be negotiating compensation for the death event.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilos climbed against this tractor by a farmer in Wales until his wife was able to blow up the animal's path.
The Oregon farmer had been eaten in 2012. After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the blood taste can be used as the “best –
- They're just toys.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All you have to do is respect them properly, he said.
The remains of my Hurrican Rosa bring extensive rainfalls to the Southwest of the United States
The Hurrican Rosa is forecast to decline as she passes over the coolest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
The northern wind speed was 38 metres per second, i.e. the first class of hurricanes, on Sunday morning, in the east coast, and it was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific Sea, heading east towards the American coast. As Roosa arrives on the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward towards the American southwest.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeter rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
A tropical humidity that is interacting with the approaching low material then forms large rainy areas for lunch in the next few days.
Locally between 25 and 100 millimeter rainfalls cause dangerous rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
A deep tropical humidity results in rainfalls of 50 to 75 mm per hour in certain areas of the fall, in particular in Nevada and Arizona.
Some regions are expected to rain up to 50 to 100 millimeter in lunch, and especially in Arizona.
Bad rainfalls are possible, and conditions can quickly weaken due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When the tropical rain is threatened, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
The heavy rains can turn the canons down into flowing rivers and thunderstorms produce local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching sub-baseline brings local hard rains to the coasts of South California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 millimeter are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfalls of the rain season in the area.
The fragile tropical rain cubes begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The rains spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see a lot of intense spillages at temperatures as the Arctic area cools, but the troupi stays quite warm.
This sometimes causes great temperature reflections at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of large temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Mission and Oman and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines.
The cooling of the summer will try again to grow and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October it is expected to be widely warm in the middle and eastern United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees from the south to the north.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday at +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, in the eastern United States, there are good opportunities for higher average heat farms in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million attended the six television broadcasts on Tuesday, in which Ms. Brett Kavanaugh, and Ms. Christine Blasay Ford, who was responsible for sexual crime in the 1980s, were fascinating to give his witness statement.
At the same time, when TV companies were suspended, the political patent situation continued with a last-minute reverse that the FBI is conducting a week-by-week investigation on the basis of an agreement organised by Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that he was drunk by Kavanaugh and tried to take his clothes off in high school.
On the other hand, Kavanaugh gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
More viewers were likely to have reported 20,4 million on Nielsen's Friday.
The company decreased the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers who look at offices.
Something about the proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of American football playoffs or the Oscar galaxy viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was at Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, on average 5,69 million viewers throughout the day's consultation.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, the interest was still high.
The middle of Friday's drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters had sent him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday.
CNN showed me how he was standing at the bottom of a minute watching the ring flying.
Seison was right in front of you, a woman said.
Do you think he'll tell the people the truth?
You have power when so many women are invincible, he was told...
Mr Flake said that his office had given an opinion and added that before the elevators closed, he would have more to be told after consultation of the committee.
A few hours later, cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the release of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced by his friends, the democratic senator Chris Coons, by the discussions he had.
Flake made his decision after discussing with the Coons and several other sensors.
The choice of Flake had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's policies
In his interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people of politics that criticise his EU differences, which threatens the future and national interests of Britain.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the conservative party in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack against his so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the proposal that Britain and the EU would make each other's import duties...

Joe Alleva, leader of LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for these news and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball in LSU.
He wrote on average 5.6 points and 2.6 balls at the match last season.
The LSU basketball coach Will Wade said, on Friday morning, he was... he'd been very upset, and he'd been shocked.
You're always afraid of something like this, Wayde said.
The volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
The ash from Popocatepetl Fire Mountains has reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexiko.
On Saturday, the Mexican disaster prevention centre called on citizens to stay far from the volcano when the crater’s activities accelerated and during the 24 hours had been registered with 183 gas and ash spills.
The Centre register grain and shakes several times.
In the social media, photos were published where cars’ windscreens in areas such as Mexico City Xochimilco were covered with thin ash.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano from the capital to southwest of the city after the earthquake of 7.1 Magnitud in September 2017.
“The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Policy and catalytic havens will be brought together before the end of the vote on independence
In Barcelona, on Saturday, six people were arrested in a meeting of protestors and melkapolis who supported independence. Thousands participated in the competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote.
The police arrested a group of masked self-loathers who threw police out eggs and powder paints that formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled with tourists.
Over the day, more dolls broke out when the police used their pumps to control the nuns.
A number of hours continued between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists, when they were shouting: no forget, no forgiveness, and the latter - let Spain live -
The local press reports that 14 people received treatment for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface of an area of independence one year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but celebrated by the catalytic havens.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the bototic vote against the differences.
According to the Katalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent assemblys over the last year when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
The groups in favour of independence spent Friday on the outside to prevent national police demonstrations.
However, it was arranged, but it had to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electric man who participated in separatists' demonstration with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in place, he says.
Many of the most well-known leaders are in a voluntary exile or in custody waiting for a trial of their involvement in the organisation of referendums and the subsequent independence declaration, despite the vital victory in the recent December regional elections.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a police demonstration on his phone, says that on both sides of the politicians, there's a flawed dispute.
\"You're getting blackmailed all the time,\" he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Cyrus leaders in prison until the last nine years, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
\"A European candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the repression that we have seen by the Spanish Government,\" he says.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car hit the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported repeatedly entering the house in Londonderry.

Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 on Mengan goal
Dolly Mengan's first goal in Livingston ensured victory
The Sr. Livingston was shocked by Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 matches in Ibrox-seur's manager.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally won at Gary Holt's team in second place with Hibernia.
Gerrard's crew remained without the first guest win of the season in Premiership. Next Sunday, it meets the serial director Hearst, who is eight points ahead.
Rangers will meet in between at the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued to fall short of six matches in the series, and the chief coach Holt has not yet disappeared once after his replacement in the last month of Kenny Miler.
Livingston lost places against a sharp lack of visitors.
The Holt team should've been running a long time before his goal was to bring Rangers into trouble in their supremacy.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finality went wide, and the next thing Alan Lithgow got to slide off the ground floor with Craig Halkett's push-ups, but he ran past the ball.
The masters gave up the ball management to Rangers because they knew they could be vaccinated from special situations.
That's exactly how the important painting came in.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played Menga a place to move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish.
By then, Rangers had kept the ball, but he said that the home team was in defense, and he didn't get much of a chance to try out of Liam Kelly.
The same pattern continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow led the ball past one more special situation in Livingston.
In addition, there was a need for the two situations to be taken into account - the decorated exchanger Glenn Middleton and the ball hit by the hand.
- Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaskair Lamont Tony Macaron's treasure
Great performance and results from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed the expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the tides.
The team's way of playing and the crew have hardly changed since its rise back to the highest serial level. However, we have to give holt credit for the way he has strengthened the team once he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great leader in a well-organized defense, while Mengan was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to the whole game.
But the Rangers were missing ideas.
The team has been very well under Gerrard at times, but it has now remained far from his standards.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once, which should be a source of encouragement to Rangers, which is the middle box of the series table.
Erdogan received a different reception in Cologne
Hymy was sensitive and sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which is intended to improve relations with NATO allies.
There have been differences in human rights and freedom of the press as well as in Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan went on his trip to Cologne to open up a giant new sulphator.
The largest Turkish population in the city is living outside Turkey.
The police stopped the 25,000 support forces from meeting before the Musquer, setting this up for safety reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters to look at the President.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also brought to their voices, condemning both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some German Turk greets him as a hero to others as he is sovereign.

Long Lartin Prisoner: Six guards were injured in restlessness
The prison officials report the high security classification of six men injured by their prisoners in the state of detention.
The spreads began at the HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, Britain’s time continued and continued.
They have brought the Tornado Special Police in place to calm down the restocks behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The police had minor facial injuries at the scene of the event.
A prisoner care informant said: “HMP Long Lartin has been sent to prison staff with special training to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been injured.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and that they may have to spend longer time behind them.
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was told that he had received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, melka police were alarmed because of serious restlessness in which people were attacked with billiard balls.
My hurrican Rosa brings a heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the drought areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical lowlands in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of the Hurricaan Rosa move across the southwest desert with the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already provided a warning of severe rainfalls on Monday and Tuesday to the cities of West Arizona, South and Eastern Equatoria, South Caucasus and Utah, and Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's supposed to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's coming in the form of rains on Monday.
Phoenix’s national weather service pointed out in his twiitt that only ten tropical storms have kept the tropical storm or low-water space at 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest designs of the national hurricane centre predict the rainfalls of 50 to 100 millimetres. In the Mogollin factory in Arizona, up to 150 millimetres can be located.
In other regions of the south-west desert, including the medium rock mountains and Great Basin, there will be evidence of 25-50 millilitres.
Rasa rains can also be a blessing by testing drought in the area if there is no risk of heavy rainfalls.
Although floods cause a serious threat, some of the rain may be useful because of the severe drought in the south lunch.
According to the U.S. Drying Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest grade, says Weather.com.
My hurrican Rosa will make her way back to the country with the California peninsula in Mexico.
Sunnuantaiaamuna is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still at a wind speed of 135 km per hour, moving north at an hour of 20 km.
The storm loses its power when faced with cooler water in the Pacific Sea.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a strong Monday night or evening storm.
In fact, Mexico's rains can be hard and cause a significant flood risk.
“From the nipple of California, it is expected to be 75-150 millimeter, and up to 250 millimeter is possible,” explains Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before she arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical lowlander on Tuesday morning hours. From there it will continue to travel through Arizona to the southern Utah on Tuesday by late.
“The greatest risks of rasa or its remains are associated with very rough rains in the California peninsula, the Northwest Sonoora and the United States of America’s southwest desert,” reports the National Arrian Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life threatening rainfalls and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.

The police are asking for contacts with everyone who may have recorded video material on the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party is an evil and angry person.
\"My judge, Kavanaugh, has a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party,\" said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered from a democratic party, an expression and anger, all the time during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh proved to be in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blaly Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which would have taken place decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also witnessed his accusations in the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said the American people saw Kavanaugh's perfection, nature and courage. That day.
\"My judge Kavanaugh's appointment is in favour of one of the most respected legal students in our day who have excellent marines for public service,\" he told his support force in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when speaking about the importance of Republicans' voting activity in indirect elections.
\"We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full, he said.
That's why I'm going all over the place to fight for the excellent candidates.

In Indonesia earthquake and tsunamis, hundreds of dead deaths are expected to rise
On Saturday, at least 384 large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many of them wiped out along with the giant waves on the shores.
I ask that hundreds of people had met on Friday at the festival on the city's beach, when the waves of up to six metres high hit the shore at night's wedding.
Tsunam caused a strong earthquake of 7,5 magnitudes.
When the tsunami’s threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not immediately run away, when they became victims of it, says the Indonesian Medical Service’s Office for Major Accidents in Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
“Tsunam did not come alone, but it carried cars, trees, houses, and hit all over the country,” says Nugroho. He added that the tsunami reached an hour speed of 800 miles [800 km] in the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing into trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The weather images published by the Disaster Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, bent and degraded bridges and a water-creating mosaic.
The follow-ups continued to treat the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were in the area where 2.4 million people lived.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Office BPPT issued an opinion saying that the energy released in Friday's vast earthquake was about 200 atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima World War II.
It says that the land of a long and narrow city at the top of the bay could have roasted the tsunami.
Nugroho described it as a destroyer, and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He told us about the ruins of some of the bodies found in the victim's bodies and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death victims and that the damage may be greater than Palusta 300 km north on a continuing coast, in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the lake.
Communication connections are completely out of hand, and Dongala has not received any information, says Nugroho.
According to the opinion of the Red Cross, over 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,\" he said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday about the fact that it did not tell the tsunami that it hit Paulu. True, the authorities said during the wave warning.
In the social media, an amateur video of the upper floor of the building screams with intense warnings for people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach will be hit by a water wall that will take over buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
Landing and tsunami caused a wide-ranging power loss that cut the communications links Please around, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue activities.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities on transport, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basic equipment.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid operations and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit Please visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The victim count of the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
The situation is really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Dongala has reached security Please enter the city where they have been housed for a tent cover in the inner courtyard of the office. On their way to the scene of destruction, Doseba says.
\"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,\" he says.
The situation is really bad.
At the start of his unsatisfied mission, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the provisions of Indonesia, funding, equipment and personnel from abroad can only start to flow when the emergency area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at regional level,” says Aulia Arrian, editor of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
“When the government says that “OK, this is a national disaster, we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.
When the second night landed, Please, after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members in the lost had the hope that, by miracle, their loved ones would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised from the drain.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian League team, had trained the two independents in the past for the Asian races that ended this month.
Roa Roa Hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandagi.
“ As an older member of the independence unit, I have my own emotional burden, ” he says.
Gendon tells us that he tried desperately to reach participants in the ranch election Please competitors on the WhatsApp weeks after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread amongst the League of Independents.
However, after he sent the messages, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blues.
\"I understand that you didn't get the messages,\" he says.

Kanye West: The laptop changes the name Ye
The rapper, Kanye West, will change his name as Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The character that was previously known as Kanye West
Ye has been the last name of the 41-year-old West for some time, and she used it as her eighth album published in June.
The change is preceded by his coming performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yanth.
He replaces the singer, Ariana Grande, who, according to the programme creator, has canceled his participation for emotional reasons.
In the past, West has said that the word also has a religious significance for him, not only is it shortened by his professional name.
When I talked about the title of the album earlier this year with the radio director Big Boy, West said, ‘I believe that ‘yes’ is the most common word of the Bible, and there is the meaning of the Bible.
So I'm you, us, and we're all.
It began with Kany, which means the only thing, and it ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which only manifests the goodness, evil, confusion, everything.
The albom is mainly a reflection on who we are.
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is well-known for the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
The former partner in West, JAY-Z, has also removed and returned the letters of the line and the big letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came at the country's approach to the 50th anniversary of revenge actions against students.
The Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, promised that no use would be made of the army for the repression of the Mexican people.
The armed forces came from peaceful demonstrations on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were entering Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and opening up free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and training opportunities is driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The US should double the funding it uses to explore artificial intelligence, when China enhances its activities, and this is how Google, Microsoft and Apple are said to be working as a financier and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications on the intelligence of the various parts of the US administration, even though the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it seeks to be the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The duplication of the budget of the research research would be a good start when it is noted that other countries are so much behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of the discovery,” says Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence would be made in the United States, Lee told us in this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book “The Great Powers of Tekoly: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order – was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO of Sinovation Venture, who has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face+.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the U.S. highest punished Othello player. Later he acted as head of Microsoft Research and as head of Google Chinese activities.
Lee recognised the former technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be arranged to identify future visionaries.
Lee says the U.S. scientists worked hard to get public support.
\"The academic influences are not taken by China, but by big companies,\" Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting universities' peaks to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to enhance their efforts to make action more effective.
“I think that those who complete an artificial intelligence doctorate should automatically issue green cards, ” he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Formerly this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to bring together partners in the world of industry and academics, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced in this month about a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, the NSF invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative aimed at establishing the National Security Commission for Action has not moved on for months.
The people of Macedonia in the referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to the Republic of Poohjois-Madodon. The change of name would solve the conflict with Greece that has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO for decades.
Greece, which owns a region of Macedonia, considers that the name of the Northern Neighbourhood is, in practice, a territorial requirement of its territory, and has therefore opposed its access to membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but, in the opinion of the nationalist opponents, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he is not going to vote in a referendum, and the campaign against vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the 50 % limit required to achieve the legal outcome.
The issue in the vote was: \"Do you agree with NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece -
The supporters of the name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price should be paid to ensure that Macedonia, as a member of both the EU and NATO, is able to become a member of the EU. .
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, on behalf of the young people in Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiyevska Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The name change will require a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities were reported by 13:00.
However, voting activity was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, at the end of which 66% of the right to vote.
“I came to vote for my children and our seats in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and her son Duskohko voted in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership .
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs in front of the superseded tents that were set up by the Scottish Parliament.
“We are running NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads in order not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn back, like China and Russia, as part of the euro-area integration -
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to the lost investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“A large majority voted in favour of changing names, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaev, after he gave his vote.
He said that there was a voice that's gonna make our future more stable.
The opinion poll published on Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia referred to the vote of 30-43% in the referendum - that is to say the activity required.
57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday at the second survey of Telma Telma TV in Macedonia.
Of them, 70% said they would vote in favour of the 'yes' option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the Western government after its uprising in May of last year.
See: The Manchester City Sergio Aguero beat the defense of Brighton with his goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have made clear traces of Brighton's defense at the Manchester City 2-0 victory at Etihad stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made it look ridiculous at 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the figure, the Argentinan top player was eaten from the middle of the field.
He found an empty space on the field by hitting three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed being surrounded by four green shirts.
He threw away one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's punishment zone.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed on the right-hand shot of Mr. Mathew Ryan's goal.
City Manageri Pep Guardiola told the journalists that \"Aguero has problems with his legs...
We were talking about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a goal in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the celestial advantage in the struggle.
The painting came on the 29th game minutes.
Aguero was in a position to get the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful feed on the left side.
Sane took some touch before he sent the ball back to the bottom of Sterling.
The enemy of the celestial blues knocked the ball into the net just before the end line.

Scherzer wants to be a fan of joy in a fight against the Rockys.
Nationals is out of the drop-off fight, so why try to get me into a set-up?
At least one competitive Scherzer hopes he will take over the feeding gum in Sunday's match against Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a drop-off at the Rockies, and they have one difference in the victory in the West Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies at least got a wild card from Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division win.
“Even though we don’t have the stake, we can get up to the feed mill, knowing that the public and the other team will be trapped here in Denver creates me the most demanding competition regime I’ve ever met this year.
Why don't I want to take the challenge?
Nationals have not yet published their beginner on Sunday, but according to the information they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he'd play 34 at the start of his match, and he'd feed on Sunday with his normal rest.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the situation in Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court candidate, who also spoke about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the mid-terms.
\"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the great-- not just a campaign, but a campaign full, and that's why I'm going all over the place to fight for excellent candidates-- he said.
Trump continued: \"You see this terrible radical group, you see it happening now.
They've decided to return to the whale belt with whatever means you can see their meanness and their evil favors.
They do not choose who is injured, or who must be gross, to gain power; that is what they want, power, and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the democratics had taken the task of being responsible and preventing them.
“And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “sold and mean and evil, and false, ”
In his reference to the most influential democratic senator of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, Diane Feinstein, the public responded with loud buds.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you get a document?
Uh, what?
Well, no, I'm just waiting for a little... it was a really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I wasn't really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported the motion of censure against me.
Well, at least I'm the last person I'm supposed to be on the line for the last representative of Labour, who they're telling me I'm not welcome, just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was opposed to anti-emetics.
In my case, the motion of censure was critical that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labour meeting said that we wanted our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
The majority of the eight years that I have been representing local Labour have been just the Fridays of the Party Council.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and more – friendly and gentler – policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differing opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues I thought had shared a similar political view began to expect me from full review and from positions I would never agree to, whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, and it doesn't really matter what I say, there's an insult belt in social media, which calls for the withdrawal of my choice, for the rejection of central policy and for me to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
I do know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I have received are of a political nature.
I very much respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day and never go wrong.
Normalisation of calculus is one of the most disturbing aspects of the policy of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corby insisted that the Labour Party adopt the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and, as a result of every motion of censure or change in the rule of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to abstain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Thatcher Government to complete school, I have been city councillored as well as in the ministry's efforts to promote better public services to those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the final elections.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my perspective or differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported this initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards a brexite that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honour, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable in Ayr block tip
Two last moments of paint made a little false about the outcome of the match, but Ayr, without denying his victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who haven't lost any fights.
At the end of the day, a great defense and a more successful risk being taken was what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased for a reason.
“We have been challenged in our fights, and we are still invincible, so I can be happy,” he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says: “All honor to Ayr, they took more risks than we did.
Ayr went to the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversio kick, but the Yellow Card of the Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, who gave up the warlors, made it possible for Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot to make a goal.
Climo raised the leadership of Ayri in the penalty lands, and right before the half of his time he made a goal and succeeded in the conversio kick, increasing the Ayri leadership to readings 17-5.
But Melrose started the second lot very well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which, at the conversio kick, Baggot managed to narrow down the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the deal when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and taken out of the field. Ayr continued to raise his leadership with Stafford McDowall's goal, which, at the conversio kick, Climo succeeded.
Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, followed by Melrosen Bruce Colvine after a heavy pressure on the paint that the conversio-pot didn't succeed.
However, the home team responded when Stuan Hutchinson received a yellow card about the talling of Climo, and Macpherson made the paint from the maul of Ayri who left the border.
Climo succeeded in the conversio kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and put Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
The Star of Still Game begins in the restaurant sector
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been appointed head of the licensed restaurant company and will therefore also start working in the restaurant sector.
The 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The twin has announced that the next nine season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public register, he is designated as Director of Adriantmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the Scottish Sun magazine suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
\"Meri belongs to us: the state of the country Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific by law.
The Marines are patrolling outside the fleet base in La Paz.
In public building flags, the sea blue flag is flying.
Ship support points for Titicacalta Amazon have been hit by a statement: “We rightly belong to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back.
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century resource war continues to be strong – as is the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest for decades when Bolivia expects the International Court decision on 1 October after five years of reflection.
“By the way, Bolivia has a strong progress, shared spirit, and perseverance, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution, ” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
A number of Bolivians around the country, wishing for a decision by the International Court of Justice on a large square, hoping that, at the end of the ongoing debate in the Hague, Bolivia's position is that Chile has an obligation to grant independent access to the sea by Bolivia.
The charismatic president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is faced with a re-election of the controversial struggle next year, is in a lot of play in the next Monday's line.
\"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close,\" he convinced the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia and, although it would be decided, the situation would not change very much.
In addition, ICJ has stated that it does not impose any possible conclusion of negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision will only be granted six months after the last comments have been made suggests that the case is not complex, says Paz Zárte, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promote Bolivia's intentions.
“The current Bolivian regime has taken the question of the sea connection, ” said Zánte.
The challenging rhetoric of the Morales has suppressed the rest of the Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to hold negotiations after this.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and the Bolivian representative in the Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the decision of the Court would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to start a new period of time in relations with Chile, and the opportunity to take 139 years of differences in mutual benefit, he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to connect with the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
\"The regulation is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past...
North Korea reported that there would be no nuclear incident unless it could rely on the United States.
North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons first unless they can rely on Washington, said North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's position came just before the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is reinitiating the U.S. nuclear weapons, only three months after the U.S. meeting with Kim Jong Unin Singapore.
Ri said that it is a long-term dream, believing that the continued sanctions and the US's opposition to the Korean declaration of the end of the war would bring North Korea on its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken important measures to promote the disarmation, Washington is on alert for adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be about to give up the military, which is likely to be seen as the only real means to guarantee his own security, has received widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is about to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris’s fashion exhibitions are presented by the great heads of the latest design, which will soon be in your vicinity as well.
If you want to magnify your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
The designers, Valentino and Thom Browne, revealed their SS19 collection of special super-initiated main belts, which would dazzle the style circles of the Paris fashion weeks.
Very unusual heads took Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion exhibitions.
Valentino's most striking creature was a beige hat with a wide-floor shirt, covering almost entirely the head of the models.
Other oversized settlements, among other things, were garnished with jewels of watermelon, vulture and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of special masks – just as appropriate before Halloween.
In several colored masks, there were obsessive lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and masked looked more like a diver, and the other reminded me of the sweet ice cream.
And if you want to take a position on behalf of a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge tops are appearing in the street view.
The oversized hats are closely followed by La Bomba, a shoulder hat with a half-meter-six, which has been seen from Riha to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the unusual, unusual, hat cult material was also used for the fashions of the second collection – the seabed made of straw, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The burnt orange with a jugular decoration with white leather handkerchiefs was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 design in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-scale hats and beach hooks next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale settlements.
John Edward: Language skills are central to the world citizen
The lessons learned from private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good results. The success has been strengthened by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30 000 pupils from Scotland, represented by SCIS from Scotland's private schools, are seeking to provide high-level services to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, continuing and higher education, as well as world citizenship.
As an operator in the education sector, who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noted the status of languages as a recommended and hoped for educational material in continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the last test results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of access to private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
Based on the information, it was found that the students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that the private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages are currently free of charge, but they are considered to be of equal value to those of natural materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in private schools' study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it became clear that 17% of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable worker were explained by inadequate language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote career development for young people in the future.
The more possible tasks will require linguistic skills, the more essential these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he has the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, despite what career he has chosen.
The Kyky communicates directly with a foreigner to put a language person automatically ahead of the competition.
According to the survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, over 4 000 adults from Isobritan are not able to speak in a foreign language, and France was the only language that was part of a two-digit figure of 15 per cent.
This is why it is important now to invest in language teaching for the children present.
In particular, learning the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some are specifically teaching languages that are supposed to be important for Isobritanians in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, in private schools, there are always several language options taught by specialised teachers.
The private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
It is true that modern languages should be seen as “intermediate communication skills” –
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scotland young people.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first performance in Los Angeles Lakers' line is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers has announced that James is playing Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, he stays to see.
\"It will be more than one, and less than 48,\" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers supplier Mike Trudell said that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
James, who followed the exercises earlier this week, was asked about his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
“ At this stage, I don’t need pre-games to prepare, ” he said.
Time of the Trump West Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election campaigns today at Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump's first five election events scheduled for next week, including compassionate targets such as Tenne and Mississippi.
When the vote is awaited to fill the free place of the Supreme Court judge's choice, Trump seeks to increase support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing majority in Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling begins at 19 o’clock on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a liveest image through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump takes the position to hear Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate for this week, who was subject to intense sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate's confirmation once a week in the investigation of the FBI.
But the primary objective for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in harsh elections in November.
The purpose of these five events is, therefore, to comment on the campaign of President Trump, to encourage volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The management of Congress is so essential for his purpose that the President is willing to travel to both states as much as possible during the urgent campaign period,” told Reuters, the anonymous representative of the Trump campaign.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters from Ohito and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit in West Virginia, a state where he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in the polls.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion surveys, ” said state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States Team shows battle skills to maintain hope before Sunday single games
After a three-sided session, Saturday afternoon four-to-four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the strength of success itself is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and even more in tournaments such as this.
Where is this success force with them at the moment?
“They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this success force as a hippo,” said Jordan Spieth walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, its advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience that they have a little bit of wind on sails and much encouragement, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play all day together and to get three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the brick to the green, leading by example.
The handings of the victory party were strengthened by his round as he succeeded in a critical tube in order to win the match at least four when he and Thomas were two points behind the two holes.
The area where they won the 15th match followed by a similar cry, which gave an idea that he believes that the United States team had not yet lost.
You have to focus very well and only take care of your own fight, Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make the effect.
The only players who have received more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four without mistakes.
\"Moliwood\" was the only pair that didn't make any bugs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Friday mornings.
Bring the round, and the way they give and get energy from this fiery audience will confirm that they are Sunday's presidencies. And when the sun falls in Le Golf National, another popular player in order to ensure Europe's potential profit could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both be in different holes at the same time.
Of course, it is premature for the success of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fell with Alex Noren, a mate named Sergio Garcia, who was a four-game hero this morning.
One bogi and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into a hole that they were not even close to getting out of there.
But on Sunday, no one's coming to help you get out of the hole.
Four balls and four games are fascinating to follow from the point of view of close cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the United States team has a battle will, although it has been suspected, in particular in the United States.
Europe will take the 10-6 leadership before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will be in good leadership before Ryder Cup last day after they took the lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-quarters from the United States.
A great pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winnings from two winning Tiger Woods, and they got the score at four points today in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which worked hard to maintain two years ago, when he lost his victory, managed the weak game of the United States team in four-ball this morning, spending the fight on the situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the leadership.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from the 12th Sunday to keep the profit.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, who are also called together “Mulliwood”, were in the history of Ryder Cup, the second twin who has won four points in the first four games.
After breaking down Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball ball, they then overrun Woods and the American beginner, Bryson Dechambeau, even more than 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived the two matches on Saturday, was sometimes very great, but still has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-game games, and even seven consecutive times.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned to the four-game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson, and Brooks to Koepka, who are the first and third at the beach.
Europe did not get everything in its desired way on this rare and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They're going to get a 2-1 win for Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four-game after the first two holes were destroyed.
Just twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from four points behind the station at the start of dual games, even though Furyk's side is enough to maintain victory.
However, after two days, the best may be that Sunday counterattack is too much to be requested.
North Korea - in no way - disarm itself without confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the UN that the continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken significant positive measures over the last year, as has stopped nuclear and missile tests, has landed the location of the nuclear tests and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
“But we have not seen such a gesture from the United States, ” he said.
\"We cannot be sure of maintaining national security in the United States, so under such circumstances the fact that we would take ourselves out of arms unilaterally is not possible.
Although Ri repeated a well-known complaint that Washington does not accept the gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate issue, it is important, however, that his statement is not completely excluded, as Mr Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-in-Office of the United States and North Korea in Singapore on 12.6.
North Korea has officially sought to conclude the war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongyang must first turn off its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to facilitating the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States are calling for “syndic deportation first, ” and they have increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goals with violence – even opposed to the ‘rare’ statement,” said Ri.
The fact that the sanctions would bring us to our knees is an immediate wish.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only deepen our distrust...
Ri did not mention the plans to organise the next Kim-Trump summit, but what Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
On the other hand, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the party requiring arms were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end.
Yet Rin's tone was significantly different from last year when he told at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continents was inevitable after the \"pad President-Trump called Kim the \"man of missiles equipped with suicide intentions\".
Another year last year Trump threatened the damage to the North Korea. However, this year Trump strongly praised Kim for his courage to approach the ceasefire of weapons, but still stressed that there was still much work left and sanctions should remain until North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he did not have a timer: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia have submitted that the UN Security Council should reward the progress made on Pjongjang's agenda.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"The strengthening of sanctions for the Security Council must continue to be strong and without failure until we prove that the total, definitive and confirmed nuclear weapons are abandoned...
The Security Council has unanimously enhanced sanctions for North Korea since 2006, with the aim of exacerbating the financial channels for production of Pjongyang ballistics and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Rin UN General Assembly and announced that he would also visit again in Pjongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit was not smooth.
When he left Pjongyang, he described the progress he made. However, North Korea condemned the Pompeon-gangsteric requirements - only a few hours later.
In the meeting with Secretary-General Moon, North Korea committed itself to the closure of the missile base and the nuclear facility earlier this month, in the event that the United States will take appropriate measures to:
According to Pompeo, Kim means, through appropriate measures, security guarantees, to which Trump committed to the Singapore meeting, and the transition towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest course
The course is a contrast to the macho culture that flourishes at the University of Harvard, where students weigh long nights with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of their own well-being issues.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard University Medical Department, who works for sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its species in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea of learning from dreams.
“After my lecture, a young woman came to me, who said, “Why am I hearing about it only now, during my last year of study?”
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising, he told Telegraph at the interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how right dreams support academic and sporting performances and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Deputy Director of Health Services at Harvard University Medical Academy, says that the university ended its course after they had heard how students suffered serious sleepiness during the study week.
The hourly course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of the living room, where a student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus obtain information on the impact of caffeine and light, as well as on the impact of sleepiness on sports performances and the importance of regular night activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-lasting sleep may increase the risks of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
“We know this has no direct impact on students’ behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these matters in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking, Professor Czeisler, more.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night long study marathons are still a subject of pride, and current technology and students always under growing pressure made the problem of dreaming a growing problem.
“To have a sufficient and high-quality sleep should be against the stress, fatigue and anxiety of students, and even against the increase in weight, because the sleep shortage causes a state of hunger in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry,” the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler to plan the course after he attended one of his courses during his first year at Harvard last year.
He tells us that the course has opened his eyes and given the impulse to all campus students to complete the course.
He hopes that all future students would be able to complete a similar set of studies before the transition to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a alarm clock to remind themselves of the bedtime in addition to morning awakening and invites them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electrical display devices and LED lighting on daytime rhythms, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan's launch won from Gerradi's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers were again experiencing a new day of defeat when Dolly Menga's shooting brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox's players were seeking their first victory then in February 4th against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard has now experienced his second loss during his 18th game manager's career. Rangers remained eight points away from the current leader in Hearts.
Menga fired the ball seven minutes before the half of the time, and then the situation was no longer levelled by the Rangers' defeat.
Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the goal difference is only higher than Hibernia.
There may be other problems at the Rangers, as Calum Spence was injured during the game in the face of an object thrown from the alien screen, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges in the composition where the team had hit Ayr and moved to the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 collection, where the team took a point from the Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when a well-structured assembly managed to control the opponent in almost every turn.
Even though Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to get the goal in two minutes, when the first hand of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free way to the Allan McGregor goal, but Pittman did not succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender Alan Lithgow managed to launch a wide-ranging backstage.
On the other hand, Rangers took control of the game, but the last third of the game in the air had no confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when in fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had met, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, ex-Ibrox's goal-in-law Liam Kelly rejected the invincible launch of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just a team of hard work.
Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long-term input tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed him to Scott Robinson, who cold-headeded the ball for a easy goal for Menga.
At the alternate Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created an appropriate opening for Morelos. However, the attack broke down Kelly's impressive quick defense.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds for each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise its leadership at the last few moments of the game. However, McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow was able to get to his station.
The Glenn Middleton, who had changed the Rangers, also called for a penalty kick when Jacobs were brought together, but again Thomson looked away.
Almaka: Geigermeter inventor
The next page is our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Gigger, future physicist, born 136 years ago in Germany today.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a equipment known as the geigerometer.
The method became one of the science support pillars, and also a key concept of pop culture, for example, is well suited for the film Coronado's watches, which was published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are presenting scientists that have a very good impact on herds:
Man: \"What a miracle is that...
Rogers: “It’s a geigermeter, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals.
Evans: “Look!
“Hans – Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
An invention that carries his name, however, still lives.
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ bad-quality cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and changed in the laboratory.
After handling, the cells injected back into the body are capable of ‘seeing’ to many eating typical proteins
Coerature has been shown to produce promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and changed in the laboratory in such a way that they can ‘see’ several types of HER2-proteins that eat.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “We believe this is a very promising vaccine.
These include breast cancer and the cancer of the ovaries, lungs and colons.
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got the critics' teeth when he praised Trumpia Saturday night Live with campaign hats on his head.
The performance did not go according to plans
Kanye West received the booms on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a dirty style and reporting to President Donald Trump in the election of 2020.
After having presented their third copy of the evening, Ghost Town, Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, the West attacked the Democrats and repeated its support to President Trump.
“ Often when I talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump, because he is racist.
If racism were a problem, I'd have changed America a long time ago, he'd say.
Last night's broadcast began on a sceptical where Matt Damon took over the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, and hearing related to the arguments presented by Christine Blasay Ford on the sexual harassment of Kavanaugh.
No direct transmission was submitted from West, but the comic, Chris Rock, downloaded it into a bitter social media.
I don't think it's obvious if Rock's intention is to mock West with his mail.
In addition, the West complained to the public that he had been treated with a hat at the end of his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm in the margin, West says in Washington Examiner's interview.
West continues: “Do you want to see what the margin means, and says that you are dressed for the Superman link, because you can’t order what I’m doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.
According to Varietto, West’s comments were blackmailing the public at least twice, and show performers seemed embarrassed. One of the present described the situation to the newspaper as follows: “The school studio went completely quiet.
West was selected with a short warning time to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers, the West was confused by the presentation of the song “I love it – a bottle of Perrier.
West is receiving support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organisation, who praised this courage on Twitter: “KIOS KUN UHMASIT ROSKAH
But Karen Hunter, the director of the discussion programme, said that West was only himself, which is once wonderful.
I can, however, decide to be a human being (including this musical or clothing mark or by supporting this art, which I consider to support and spread the ideaology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us, he added.
The rapper announced that he had changed his name on Twitter before the evening, which was previously known as Kanye Westná-
West is not the first artist to change his name. Music follows this Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and, of course, we also remember Prince of the late music legend, who changed his name to the symbol and later as an artist who was known before Prince.
Belfast's restaurant surgeon is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is charged with a murder attempt after he was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in Belfast East.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore region.
The accused is expected to be before the Belgian court on Monday.
The charge shall be reviewed by the General Public Prosecutor's Office.
The actress, Kit Harington, is in charge of toxic masculineism.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-breathing hero role in the violent fantasy series of Jon Snow HBO.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of the machasankar: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by hard.
In an interview with the Cultural Union of Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “sometime has gone wrong, ” and questiones the available means of addressing toxic masculine in the time of the #MeToo phenomenon.
In addition, Harrington, married to Rose Leslie, who is part of the Starcard of the Kingdom Game, also 31 - year - old, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we have gone wrong with masculineism is that I am now experiencing intense feelings, ” he says.
\"What has been taught to men in years of their growth, which has now led to the problems that exist,
Harrington believes that television and its very masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is inside birth and what has been learned?
What is learned on TV and on streets that make young boys feel like they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of pre- or downstream parts of the Revolutionary Game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, been able to obtain the need for fields of battle and horses.
In November, Harrington is seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play on True West, which tells us about the film producer and this mugger brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose's wife was the best thing that the Revolutionary Game has offered him.
\"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,\" she says.
Rose Leslie pretended to be Ygritte, Jon Snow's love target in the fantasy series, the Harrington act.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's premises in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased in China by 14%
China has reported an increase of 14% of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
Health authorities say that the virus in the country affects the lives of more than 820 000 people.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions contaminated in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan county conference, the HIV infection in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection via sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination between LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
Many diseases result from insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving measures.
Maxine Waters denies the data of the employee's leaked Republican installation and accuses the dissemination of dangerous lies and secrets.
On Saturday, Mr Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contested the claims that his employees had published personal information on three Republican sensors on the Wikipedia pages.
The democratic representative from Los Angeles assured us that there are “peripheral right-of-the-art” commentators and websites.
He says in his opinion on Waters Twitter.
According to the information published, the address and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing South Carolina, are reported.
An unknown person published information on Thursday, during the hearing of the Senate Committee, about the charges of sexual abuse against Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
A little happened after three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pounds and RedState report that, according to the Hill report, messages were published from the IP address attached to Waters' office and by the person belonging to Waters staff.
\"This unwarranted accusation is completely wrong and it's an absolute lie,\" Water continued.
\"My employees, whose identity, identity and safety are at risk of these sincere and false charges, are not responsible for the leaking of these data.
This unwarranted accusation is completely wrong and absolutely a lie.
Waters' statement received fast criticism on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by the former press secretary Ari Fleischer of the White House.
“The way he denies this is very hostile, ” wrote Fleischer.
“It seems that his character is incompatible with Congress’s member.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostilely.
There's no reason to be threatened.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
The situation should behave moderately and calmly.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who competes at Waters in the exhibitions of Congress, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
It's amazing if this is true, he's your quote.
Waters announced in his opinion that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities for these sincere accusations.
\"We believe that the factors will be exposed, he continued, \"and that they will be placed under legal responsibility for all the destructive and dangerous measures against some or all members of my staff...
Johnny English hit again – a low-efficiency Agent Parod of Rowan Atkinson
It has already been established to look for redxite references from anywhere in the British direction. However, this does not appear to be appropriate for Johnny English Agents' industry and the working media series, which began in 2003 by Johnny English and re-embarked into the next part of 2011, John English – newly born.
Can the language of the nation's satir in the cheek become a new British national export journey?
Yes, or so, the mulky, rubber-like and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to repeat already. His name says above all that it is a collection of creation aimed at a film market outside the English-speaking world.
Of course, it's about the tedious secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe around the melting glamour, but appears to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and it's an unlucky single note musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The design is based on a brand-new cosmopolitan and a mysterious world man who was originally presented by Atkinson in the TV commercials of Barclaycard.
It's the last show we've ever had.
I thought especially of the scene where Johnny English comes on helicopters dressed in a mid-term trailer, and the rotohori's ships are creaking his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts are getting out, but the humor itself seems to be under-efficient and unusually unnecessary, especially because of the fact that ‘vatava’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today offer humor as part of the film's main content.
The humor seems to be directed to children, and the treatment of Johnny English doesn't seem to me to be as ingenious and sharp as the comets of Mr. Bean's mulky roles.
The year-on-year starting point is that Britain is in trouble the worst time.
The Cyber hacker is infiltrated in the British high-level spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents operating in the field as a sturdy of an agent, presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little role.
This is the last drop to the most important and superficial Prime Minister, who is already finished with his ears in political favour: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May, but the script doesn't just offer him enough space.
When the intelligence advisors inform him that all the spies on the field have been exposed, they must call someone who has already moved aside from active service.
It is, of course, a türoiva Johnny English in his own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher of a beauty school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the art of spying.
English will be congratulated at the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again with an endless patient battler Bough, which is still being played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a diver whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to get to his rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service in order to meet Olga Kurylenko's fatal supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming the manipulation of the charismatic IT billionaire.
English and Bough's odyssey turn into a farfars: the masked twin lights the fire of a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in their search for the luxury yachts of Volta. With the help of the virtual glass of Volta's house, the company will end up in a pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the authors will be cursing at the final scene, but despite all the incompetence and charm, the film still seems a little bit like a child audience.
You can think of the movie as a destiny.
Johnny English while watching movies, I have come to the same conclusion: why does the British film industry not be able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day salary
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, considered a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is said to call upon the corporate leaders to transfer savings generated by the artificial revolution in the form of an extra day of leave for workers.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy the same salary for three days of the weekend.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘sopis’ in the economic programme of the party and its plans to make policies more expensive for workers.
The organisation of trade unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party will tell the Sunday Times newspaper: “The review of the Act has been announced before the turn of the year.
The change does not take place at the moment, but the four-day working week is an objective which is compatible with the party's approach to balance the economy for workers, as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first body to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to support the transition to a four-day working week in connection with its referendum campaign in 2017.
However, the objective shall not be to provide undivided support for Labour's lines.
The President of the Labour Party notes: “The working week of tomorrow is not a party’s policy, and the party does not consider such a transition:
Mr John McDonnell, Minister of Finance, used the working conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover the power of the provincial dictators, and of those of general interest.
According to the Finance Minister of the shadow government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their entire share because the government led by Labour would be able to take action on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to set employees in corporate management and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies’ share capital to employees’ management.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing a 60-minute programme on whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation of the prosecutions of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President of the FBI, has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question of whether the result of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican agents to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60-minute programme period to Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out what they could change their mind.
Kennedy was more open-minded compared to his colleague in South Carolina.
Of course, Kennedy said.
I told you I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations came out, and I asked him, 'Are you doing it?'
He was determined, determined, clear.
As a result, Graham's voice seems to have been hacked.
\"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb threat,\" he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett strongly contested it, Graham added Christine Blaly Ford, referring to it.
“No one of the people he designated was able to confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York is a musical event with the same effect as its mission: the eradication of poverty from the world.
Now the 7th time Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real objective of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
In 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is to continue with the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people active in poverty eradication.
In order to obtain a free ticket event (if it is not willing to pay the VIP flag), the public shall carry out various tasks or works, such as voluntary work, to send an email to the political decision-makers or to make a call, or to perform any other activity which disseminates awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citize been successful, now that there is no longer 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert flag a real way to convince people to take action, or is it just one of the ‘clicitism’ others – an idea that the world can change by signing a web address or by sending a quote?
Global Citizen announces that he has recorded more than 19 million works on behalf of the different objectives, starting from 2011.
According to the fact that these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles worth more than USD 37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds achieved have already had an impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in Great Britain, committed to helping children develop their full potential, and the Group committed to delivering Rwanda 35 million dollars to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists sent them 4 700 cents as a result of the Global Citize campaign.
The British Government, donors, governments of different countries, and just like you, the world nations, can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the press of history, the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, said to the public at the conference held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also invited to take action to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions.
One of the questions raised on the website of the movement is: “What do you think we can do about extreme poverty?
The Global Citizen answer: “This is going to be long and difficult, and there are many pieces of compromise ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, as great civil rights battles and anti-partheid movements before us, because together we are stronger...
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running a concert in New York this year, and its star card includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janele Monae.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country can make energy exports difficult by using the fleet as an obstacle.
According to Minister Ryan Zinke of the United States of America, the Washington Examner magazine, may, if necessary, rely on the assistance of its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russian activities in Syria – the invitation of a legal government – are an excuse for identifying new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that [Russia]'s fault of being present in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as it is in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the administrator, there are ways and means to prevent this.
“The United States have the ability to keep shipping routes open by means of their fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end on the world market,” he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is profiled as a voice tower for energy consumers in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
“Iran and Russia’s economic alternative is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel in the second, he says, and describes Russia as a circus number of a single pace, the economy based on fossil fuels.
Opinions are up-to-date in a situation where the Trump's administration has sought to improve the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace it with much cheaper Russian liquidated natural gas.
In order to enhance this, the regime of Trump, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘unspoken’ ‘Nord Stream 2’ pipeline project, which says President Trump is bound by the Moscow farm in Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, to be a purely economic project.
The Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and it is an example of unfair competition.
\"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose its supplier,\" says the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has resulted in a counter reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roofing organisation, the German Industrial Union, has called on the United States to stay separate from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The fact that the third country is involved in our energy supply is very problematic,” said the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin, director of the German Industrial Union.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to give careful consideration to the position in the presidential elections in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, announced that he would carefully remove from his position as a presidential candidate after midterms.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the proposal at an open hearing in Holyek, Massachusetts.
“It is time for women to move to Washington and repair our innocent administration, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” said The Hill magazine.
After the sixth day of November, I intend to carefully consider the establishment of a candidate for President-in-Office.
Warren estimates President Donald Trump's chance to say that he's taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump does for our democracy, ” he says.
Warren has appeared in direct criticism of Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday night's week's week, Warren wrote that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, according to the survey published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters are not in favour of this position in 2020.
According to the study carried out by the University of Suffolk Institute for Policy Research and Boston Globe, 58% of the most likely voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of the Senator's position.
32% were in favour of a candidate.
Several of the respondents supported the position of former governor Deval Patrick at 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other discussions include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has officially stated that he will decide on his proposal by January.
Sarah Palin refers to his son's war traumas at Donald Trump's election meeting
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting armed forces in September.
Track Pal was arrested on Monday night and was charged with family violence
“What my own son will have to go through when he returned home, I can well identify with the other families that will face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers will bear when they return home, ” he told the public meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest in the “flux of the living room” and said his son, as other war veterans, who had turned home a little, they would return as they were hard, they would come back, wondering if they would respect what he and his partner had done in the army and in the air force for this country.
Track Pal was arrested on Monday in Alaska, Alaska. According to Dr. Dan Bennett, the Wasilla police informant, he was charged with family violence and assault on women, as well as with domestic violence and the processing of the weapon.
The 18 states and the Columbia Federation support the action taken against the new asylum policy
The eighteen states and the Columbia Federation are seeking a change to the new line that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
18 states and allies have left a letter of law on Friday in Washington. The letter supports infringing asylum seekers reports NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberals Union in August against the federal order.
He tells his partner, and his sons of violent gangs, who assaulted him, and the U.S. authorities were inconvenient with him on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, supported by Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large proportion of which are nationals of the United States of America, are countries where gang and family violence have spread to all levels of society.
The US's new asylum policy has been abrogated by a decision of the appeal committee on asylum applications in 2014, according to which paperless migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his statement on Friday, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia Federation, Karl Racine, commented that the new line would ignore the decades of state, federal and international law.
\"The law of the Member State requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this kind of obstacle would be infringed by the letter of friends of the law.
The prosecutors also claim in a letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers' access is damaging the US economy because the firemen are likely to become entrepreneurs and bring the necessary additional labour force.
In June, General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
‘The place of residence is intended for persons who flee from their country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a certain class of society or political opinion.
The asylum was never intended to solve all problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survival in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled
For survivors, the situation is becoming even more serious.
“Tilanne is very tense, ” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, dissatisfactioning her hot baby, at an evacuation center in the degraded city.
\"Ambulances give me one minute to bring new bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is still to be hidden.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospitals that have been damaged in the wake of the 7.5 magnitudes are full.
Some injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest please outside the military hospital, where patients are treated for continued, powerful follow-up.
His eyes are filled with tears when he colluded, how fierce an earthquake filled the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck between the ruins of the wall, so I thought Harris would tell me, according to Associated Press, and tell me that he and his family were married guests in town.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador blames China on provocation - propaganda reports -
The U.S. Ambassador accused Beijing of using the American magazine as an propaganda tool, which happens a week after the Chinese newspaper had published four pages in the United States newspaper, a commercial that boasts the mutual interests of the United States-China trade agreement.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the Annex to the China Daily magazine in Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after being accused of involving China in the 6-11 Congress elections.
According to the US elections, Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere with the US elections mean a new phase in the Washington enlargement campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently always stuck in an ecstatic trade war, where both parties impose customs duties on the exporting products of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, the Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador of China and long-term governor of the state of Iowa say that Beijing has committed damage to the US working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products in China.
China is now further engaged in provocation by publishing propaganda notifications in our own free press, writing in its opinion published on Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
“By taking down its propaganda, the Chinese Government will benefit from the traditions of the United States’ well-rated free word and press by setting out a paid declaration to Des Moines Register, ” Branstad writes.
“In the pages of the streets, however, differing views can only be seen in limited terms, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can see from alarming developments in their economies; this is due to the fact that the media is strictly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he writes.
Branstad continues by telling us that “one of the largest newspapers in China claimed to publish the offer, ” the article he wrote, but does not specify which magazine it is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasko is exterminateing female speakers from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many Republicans are standing behind and defending the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, may, according to analysts, cause counter-reactions, especially in the forthcoming election of female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been a major round, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed in the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” says Professor Grant Reeher of the University of Syracusen in the article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flakeen (Republicians, Arizona) in the last minute's offer to the FBI investigation of angry voters.
“ Women don’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, the older advisor and the reporter of the National Reform Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, protestors sang: “The November is coming, in the light of the opinion of the ruling Republicans of the Senate, when the judicial committee decides to proceed in Kavanaugh’s appointment, which took place despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford’s testimony, Mickey reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be assessed,” says Stu Rotheenberg, an unbinding political analyst in interviewing the news website.
People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and it is true.
But it could be even more important, especially for female insecurity voters and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote because they do not like the President.
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans are moving forward with confirmation even before the Ford's Declaration of Justice against the candidate for the Supreme Court, where this claimed sexual harassment.
\"This is becoming a confusion to the Republican Party,\" said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
“It is not just a vote of the Committee or a final vote or a question whether Kavanaugh will be called into question; it is a question of how Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Fordia, Guy Cecil, the head of the United States Group of Priorities, which supports democracy, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided by whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh’s statement of witness to the latter.
According to the new opinion survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's statement of witness is absolutely or probably, while 35% says that they believe definitely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or absolutely lying in his witness statement, whereas only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
When Flake set up the case, the FBI will investigate Ford and at least one other charges of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian's report.
In front of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Kavanaugh had been lying to him in drinkings while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for membership of the Supreme Court revealed to him at the student party of his family while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor is planning to launch a new Internet counter-attack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, has launched a startup company aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In the interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the aim of Inrupt is to control the world.
\"It has to be done now,\" he said, referring to his start-up attempt.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal data storage.
It may include contact information lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available at a single browser at the same time.
In a personal repository, it is unique to have a full user who has access to any type of data.
The company calls it, through information, for personal entry into force:
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to give resources, processes, and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
At present, the company comprises the security platform at Berners-Leen, Brucen, IBM, some employees working with the project and a community consisting of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website. This is all available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss \"Facebook and Google\" with whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models will be translated into their heads together at night.
\"We do not ask their consent to the matter:
In its article Berners-Lee, which was published in the media on Saturday, the Inruptin task was to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994 Berners-Lee soiled the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has had an impressive voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains its position as the founder and manager of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute after Inrupt’s launch.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next period of time of the network, ” Berners-Lee added.

Michael Vann says that it is “a great honour to take part in the parade, ” adding: “A great crowd of people is remembering the glory of a true hero.
The friends of the free fight waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Possu
Imagine a situation where you've been monitoring all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament and not present the whole event.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, of which six main series matches, and the show was to be presented as a live broadcast on Channel 5 in Britain.
In the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to the great stunners of Pipsa Posku.
Some viewers were not really happy to be monitored for the whole night's fight.
A friend of the free fight opened up on Twitter to replace the match with a children's designed, sick joke.
According to the law, this content was not suitable to be presented at 6 a.m. in the morning, so they had to switch it to the children's programme, explained Dave Schwartz, the Deputy Director for Marketing and Communication of Bellator's parents.
\"Pipsy Possu, yes,
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellato, said that timetables would be made to work so that British viewers could follow events in the future.
I'm thinking about a re-dispatching that's probably gonna make us do the program, Coker said.
However, the bell will be there in the morning and we will not be able to present a programme before Sunday, which is Monday in turn their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages began to go in the direction and to the other and they were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the number of matches from five to six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and we tried too hard.
This is a terrible situation.
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to her sexuality
Tom Dale, a swimmer, and an Olympic athlete, tells us that he felt inferior to all others because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that she just found out she was in high school when she said that \"all things aren't the same as me.\"
When Lauren Laverne was running on Radio 4 Dessert Island Discs, Dale said that he spoke about gay rights to give others a good look.
He also tells us how, after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a regular pioneer in the long-term radio programme, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first programme, Daley told me that he knew himself as a youther than everyone else, because he had not been socially acceptable to keep his boys and work...
He says: “To this day these feelings, feel less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me strength and energy that I have needed for my success.
He says that he wanted to show himself ‘jot’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality finally discovered.
The double Olympic provincialist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and it appears in this year's National Community competitions to criminalise homosexuality in other countries.
He said he was coming out because he felt lucky to live openly without sanctions and wanted to give ‘sound’ to other people.
Three times the world champion tells a man of his love – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 – as a surprise –
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things when you’re so young... he took part in his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later... it’s hard to find another age of the same kind that would have experienced the same kind of contribution and opposition, ” says Daley.
The couple received a boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – the result of which the Daley-size perspective has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have been surrounded by the victory of the gold medal, ” he says.
You know, there are bigger things than the golden Olympic medal.
Robbie's my Olympics.
His son received his name according to Daley's father, who died in 2011 only when he was 40 years old.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets.
I couldn't tell him he'd never be there to be on the front row, Daley says.
“I kept her hand when her breath stopped, but only after her breath had really stopped and she was dead, I finally realized that she was not vulnerable, ” she says.
The next year, Daley competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won the pross.
\"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life, \"to jump in front of the community in the Olympics. \" There's no better feeling, Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first hometown – Heather S Model’s copy “Proud” who raised feelings when he was already preparing for the Olympic Games, and who still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-art Mickelson exchange bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The United States Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he has to be very disappointed to avoid a record tour as an unforgivable performance in history.
Mickelson, who plays a game-playing event every two years, took a record 12th time, from Captain Jim Furyk's exchange bench, for the time of the four-sixth of Saturday's game.
In general, the American five-fold Major tournament winner at the center of the attention now spent half the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to get his shot.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most precise drivers on his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing career punishs unsuspected hits.
If the field itself is not enough against Mickelson, the 9th Sunday game against is known for its accuracy as the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is playing together with the resident Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to locate all four winning pipes this week.
If the Americans, which are four points behind when they come to 12 dual games, get a flying departure, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could he say?
He's perfectly aware of the role he played today, and he killed me in the back, a little bit, and said he was ready for tomorrow, so Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went, and that's how we ended up.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson violates Nick Faldon's record of most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 profits, 20 losses and seven half, but according to Fury, his presence will bring something undefined to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to joke at the expense of people, and he’s a funny guy who everyone likes to be with, ” he explains.
“The younger players must also have had fun with him this week. It’s a pleasure to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stakes in the game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long leadership can disappear rapidly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's measured leadership before the last day's dual games can become a rough journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led him to five points of leadership over the Americans, but who survived as a winner with just and just the size of his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin of 141-2 to 31-2.
“It reminds us of how we ran out of Valderrama, we ran out in Brookline, where we lost, but we won Valderrama, although scarcely,” said Bjorn, after looking at the team of 5 to 3 in 2018, both on Friday and yesterday on the 10 to six in Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big skank.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only at it.
As I've always said, I'm focusing on these 12 players that play on our side, but we're aware of what's on the other side of the world's best players.
I'm glad that his team players are out of a difficult field, Bjorn adds: \"I'm never licking until it falls into these kinds of things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow, the priority is to have individual performances, and then we talk about different things.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested with the bottoms.
This is a message that must be transmitted to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to whom alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, the other half captain Jim Furyk will require better performance from his players as individuals than they could as partners. By way of derogation from this, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last-day full-time translations in both directions, and he was involved in a team that won in Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won \"Medinah's miracle...
“I remember every evil word, ” he replied to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team, gave the team the last day to come.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it comes to moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average games.
We've adjusted our composition accordingly, and we'll put the boys on the field as we wish, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defense battle and he meets Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are coming to meet their European opponents.
\"I put the group's guys in this order, because I think it's going through the whole tournament,\" Bjorn commented on the choices of the two games.
Germany's new warship is delaying again
The new fleet of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The objective of the vessel was to replace the old-age cold-war equipment, but it will be introduced at the earliest time next year due to poor systems and rising costs, local media will be reported.
According to the military reporter who spoke to the Die Zeit magazine, the launch of the new Baden-Württemberg Class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-transmission problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the older Bremen-class fregates.
According to the available information, they are equipped with effective cannons, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, as well as emergency technologies, such as radar reflection and infra-red and acoustic signals by means of a technology that reduces the detection.
The main features of the ship also include its longer maintenance distance – new fregates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going to the home port.
However, the constant delays mean that the leading warships of technology, which are said to be aimed at improving German influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete at the time they enter the service, the Die Zeit magazine points out.
The poor F125-fregatti ended up in headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the platform and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after it has been delivered.
For reasons of feedback, there is little known, but Germany's media has been talking about essential software and equipment - which make a warship out of unfit combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg category is about 120, which is only half of the crews of the older Bremen class.
It was also found that the vessel is highly overweighted, reducing its performance and limiting the possibilities of the fleet to later updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the corresponding class used in the second World War in Germany.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the whole project's price base is also developing a problem.
The price is multiplied by an increase of EUR 3.1 billion, with an initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of using new fregates have arisen when German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans- Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable ships are running to the least.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ships have been submitted.
He complained about the fact that no fregate of the Baden-Württemberg class could be introduced into the fleet.
Environmental Organization eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
A new study in the upper part of Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the soil in hunting food.
The new study is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future protection measures.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland monitors the poor and midgets, as well as earbreads and water wings in the Inverewe Garden district of Wester Ross.
In the investigation, special storage equipment shall be placed at the main points of the area to monitor the operation of rest during the period.
Organisation staff and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the recordings as well as the nature of which it is involved will be ensured by an analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a map and a report on the environment will be created where the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture of the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's natural protector hopes to reveal the results which areas of the living environment are most important to bats, and how different species use them.
Information is helpful in planning the areas of the living environment, such as the creation of wetlands and the management of forest areas, so that bats and associated species are taken into account.
In the last hundred years, the population of Scotland and the whole UK bats have decreased significantly.
Building and construction work threatens rest areas and living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, including flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as the attacks on pet cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of the top hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching the catch than in the eye.
The bats use advanced scaling techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation that focuses on the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 acres of land – and they take rest seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, check rest sites and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only rest protection zone for the countries of the Threave Map in Dumfries and Galloway, eight of the ten bat species of Scotland are met in the region.
According to the manager, David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
“Threave is very good for bats, ” he says.
\"We have old buildings and trees and, in all, a good living environment.
The rest is not yet known, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to understand better what batters need to succeed.
He stresses how important it is to check the buildings for bats before taking up rehabilitation, because the disposal of one resting place of rest can inevitably cause up to 400 female leprosy and male deaths and destroy an entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and their killing, interference or destruction of rest places are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Union for the protection of widows, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don’t know how their populations are doing.
Rondodo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing the case against the German magazine
Crisiano Rondodo has identified him as “the expression of violence ” and says that people want to“ paint themselves, ” using his name.
The lawyers of Ronaldo have taken action to sue the famous German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of the rape of a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a lasvegasilla hotel in 2009.
He claims to have paid the victim $375 000 for the silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
At the Instagram direct broadcast, he was only present to 142 million followers, after hours of claims. A 33-year-old footballer rejected the charges and described them as “the original ”.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, lying, five-fold Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine. The player kept smiling.
According to the Reuters News Office, Dr Spiegel’s lawyers are preparing for the trial of Der Spiegel for claims that they have called \"unusual reporting of doubts covered by privacy protection\".
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, says the player is demanding compensation for spiritual suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious breach of personal rights over recent years.
The alleged case is said to have taken place in the suite of Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009.
It is said that he met at the night club and moved to a player's room where he is alleged to have raped this analy, according to the documents provided by the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mr. Mayorga claims that, after the alleged event on his knees, he had reported that he had a 99 % good type, but one per cent, he was disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of having sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police station and took photographs of his injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in the conciliation process, because he was, in his late warning, about the possibility of revenge and his concern, he was subject to public humiliation.
The 34-year-old now says that he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure, as he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Mr. Rondodo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged appeal from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team to Juventus with a USD 100 million agreement.
Brexit: Great Britain would regret forever.
If it were to lose its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he had to keep the notification of the United Kingdom unit of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Burnaston Derby if Britain is to leave the EU without an agreement.
We need a deal, Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays on visible job losses if brexin is terminated without a contract.
Almost 150 000 cars were manufactured in Burnaston last year and 90% were taken to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain is suddenly out of the EU at the end of March, we will have interruptions in our production,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Burnaston unit in Tokyo.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honduras, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed the fears of getting rid of the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that he will close his factory to manufacture for a month in the event of brexit.
The main concern is that according to the report by car manufacturers, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the non-contractual brexit.
Toyota's production line is run in the right-time JOT principle, where parts are available to the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If Britain leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages.
The maintenance of more than 24 hours of storage at Derbyshire plant is impossible according to Toyota and production would be interrupted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU Relations Plan is calibrated to its attention to avoid these checks at the border.
“We need a deal, and we want the best possible agreement that does not just mean success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of,” he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
“Not only in Toyota, but also in other manufacturers’ opinions show that we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains up to now.
Toyo cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would be reduced to the competitiveness of the establishment and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as a professional association agent at the factory, says a concern among the growing members: “My experience shows that jobs lost will never come back.
The government informant says: \"We must present an accurate and credible plan of our future relations with the EU:
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be extended to another week.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russia's intervention in elections, the contacts of Trump's assistants with Russia and the President's possible activities to prevent justice.
In Washington, for months now, Trump's intention is to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would endanger the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to its Rosenstein centres the possibility of recording secret discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of disabling the President on the basis of Appendix 25 to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to tell us that Rosenstein had resigned.
However, at that time President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting day was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not prefer to separate Rosestein, but the meeting was postponed because it was the time when he was brought together with the hearing of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had been accused of him, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, both of them.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly study of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which continued to delay the Senate's vote in plenary.
The Trump Press Manager, Sarah Sanders, was performing on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said: “The number has not been set for this, and it could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for a week after everything else due to what is happening at the highest court.
But I always want to keep the press up-to-date.
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since 10 September.
The newsman, Chris Wallace, asked for a reason.
Mr Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to other reasons than the dissatisfaction with TV suppliers' request for attention, but said: \"It does not deny the fact that they are being taken into account...
Sanders, however, made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would continue to increase.
\"The President is more interested in Question Time than any president before him,\" he says, and more evidence of thesis: \"We've checked these numbers...
“The press events will continue to be organised,” Sanders said, “but it is extremely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss them with me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen us act this way several times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States.
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with his or her guests.
The presentation alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown the reason for this when he was showing up to journalists who had met him in an unsuspected and time.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries from Scotland's public health system (NHS Scotland) in relation to the fears of redxit.
The Minister of Health has written a letter from EU countries to workers from Scotland’s health care system to express their gratitude and wish to them to remain in the country after brexit.
Mr Jeane Freeman, Commissioner of Scotland, sent a letter while the time for the United Kingdom's resignation from the EU is less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of the established status of EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In its letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards future decisions in autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for possible contractual separation.
I know you all have these uncertain times.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate each of our employees' contributions to citizenship without looking at them.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Tenssee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in an emergency operation since the team was destroyed for 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, report to Tenssea supplier Mike Organ.
Mr Rod Reed, head coach of Tenssee State, told the reporters that they had been injured just before half.
\"He came to the sideline and simply fell down to it,\" says Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie an acid on the sideline before they put him on a couple and took him aside for a more detailed assessment.
Tenssee State's editor told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tenssee, that Abercrombie has reached the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that there was no information available on the type or extension of the infringement at this stage, and that Tenssee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second year student at the Tenssee State University and is the first one to play in the team after he's moved out of Italy.
He had five fights on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on their purchase of real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in Great Britain. Additional money will be used to help homeless people as planned.
The aim of this amendment is to neutralize the success of Corby in attracting young voters
The increase in the levy is for those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May is coming to inform foreign buyers today of the higher rate of stamping when they buy properties in Great Britain. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as a company to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper dwellings and paid attention to good income taxation.
The increase in Leima tax is directed at people and companies that do not pay taxes to Great Britain, and this extra money will be directed by the government to facilitate the suffering of homeless people.
The additional fee, which will be added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the 2nd harvest and investment income increases, can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-German residents, which will increase prices and make it more difficult for primary housing buyers to have their own holdings on the market.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain – especially its capital – have become ‘a ghost shops’ because several foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new approach will only take weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduced rate of bread tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate high by buying the country and not building it, and asked Prime Minister Mayta to reject the quotas for affordable housing in order to remedy the disgraceful situation in Britain.
Corbyn has published a series of significant proposals for reforming the housing market, including the restrictions on the mountain and the cessation of economical evictions.
He would also like to give delegations more authority in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I wanted to devote my prime term to the British dream – that every generation of life should be better than its predecessors – to return.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It cannot be right, however, that persons who do not live in Great Britain and companies abroad can buy housing as easily as hard as the people of Great Britain.
Too many people have become far too distant a dream of having a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.
Jack Ross: \"My first goal is to run the Scotland National Team...
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his \"his ultimate goal\" is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old scotch is excited about its challenge to raise the country's home-to-home team back on its feet. The team is currently in the third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the stadium on the lights – this summer after he had guided St Mirren back to Scotland during the last season.
When I was a kid, I wanted to play on my country team.
I got into team two, and it was there, Ross tells me at the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I often watched Scotland's games with Hammeden, and it's something that's always pulled me back.
That's the only way I'm gonna be able to do this if I'm going to succeed as manager of the company.
Ross’s predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Atleti says that he was not concerned about entering the boots of his name-in-laws, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“ At this moment, I will see my own success as to whether I can restore this company to the selection.
Based on the structure of the Society and its ability, it is undoubtedly part of the range, he says.
It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I'm only going to be successful if I can get my team back to the election board.
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first, as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heat Coach Group.
After this he helped Alloa rise from the three-series drop-off games and raised St Mirren's fall during the next season.
Ross says he's feeling better now than ever during his career in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
I was probably in a real pioneer relationship with my career, and he remembers the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
\"I believed I was better suited to manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I made a lot of money, and I got to enjoy some relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
The player has to figure out a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, such as stress and pressure from work, but running a team seems to be exactly the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it, and I feel better in my body than I've ever felt in my adult life...
The whole interview is listening at Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, at Radio Scotland frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the chair is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows
The summer thermal wave has set fire to the pubs fighting with British difficulties, but at the same time, it has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the outputs of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures compiled by Peter Martin's business consultant from CGA say: “The continuous solar weather and the longer than expected participation in the football World Championships meant that, in July, the sale of pubs such as June was 2.8% higher, whereas for restaurants the month was even worse.
The 1.8% decrease in the sales of restaurants in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars concentrated on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the sales of restaurants.
The pubs concentrated on the food side also suffer from brightness, but less dramatically than those who run restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted out of their mind to drink.
The sales of pubs and bar drinks were increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of food had a 3% decrease.
Paul Newman of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services says: “The results continue, which has continued since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the out-of-house catering market.
It is no surprise that the trafficking of restaurant chains will continue, although the decline in sales of 4.8% annually is apace, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressure.
A long hot summer could not have become worse for the food-focused operators, and only time will it be possible to show that the most severe temperatures of the industry are brought into the breathtaking process that is urgently needed.
The combined total increase in sales of beans and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowing trend in setting up new brands.

The fifth part of children secret social media accounts with their parents
The fifth part of children, some of whom are 11 years old, is secreting social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says
A survey of 20,000 upper school pupils revealed the existence of an increasing ‘Instagram feiktils’ phenomenon
The news raised the concern that the accounts could be divided into sexual syllable content
20 per cent of the students said they were holding a ‘head title’, to be shown to parents
The fifth part of children, some of which are up to 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper school pupils revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram feiktils’, which refers to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that the accounts can be published in sexual health.
20 per cent of the students told them that they thought they were cleaning a clean ‘head account’ for parents at the same time as they were using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager, in which she hoped she would be raped after she came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rotor Conference (HMC), 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 kept two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted to hold secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says: “It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilith Doyle – The voice of athletes – the government of Scotland’s athletes
Ms Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Government, who will attend the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most awarded general athlete in Scotland. The Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from extensive international experience in the last decade of the athlete.
“Nelidhi is highly respected with athletes in Scotland, Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scotland’s athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government,” says Beattie.
Doyle says: “I look forward to the role of athletes in the right direction, and I hope that I can be of benefit and help guide Scotland’s sport in the right direction.
Four Olympictic athletes who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips to Atlanta in 1996, the Olympics, operating as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost their walking ability as a result of a passing blood circulation disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke...
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's only time for me to show you how well I'm gonna recover and what I'm gonna do.
This has been a tiring job, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm already working on the chain!
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
Mothers-to-be cow advertising distributes opinions online
The advertising of a company producing breast pumps that breast-feeds mothers with lypsyles has spread opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has put on the market a product called \"the world's first silent and to be dressed as a breast pump – its marketing will be accelerated by means of a advertising with a music video style that describes the freedom of a new pump for lactating mothers.
Four true - life mothers danced in the cattle, among other things, with the following song, saying: “Yes, I’m short, but if you didn’t see him, they are not roads, they’re boobs.
The story continues: “Ping it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pylons it out, lypsy my ledgers,
However, the advertising published on the Facebook website of the company produced a discussion online.
77 000 viewers and hundreds of comments collected by the video have raised a conflicting reaction to viewers. Many say it is going to ruin the daily ‘favores’ of the dairy industry.
\"The use of cows in the advertising of this product was a very poor decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so that they can produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth, one commenter writes.
Elvie bra pump is an unobtrusive fit to fit in the breast-feeding line (Elvie/Mother)
The second viewer commented: “It’s tragic, both for the mother and for the baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who may have their baby?
The third comment added: \"A total reality advertising –
I also received defenders from Mainos: a woman admitted that she thought that the commercial was “suppite. ”
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I still breast-feed.
The partnership made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product, reads in one comment.
The second viewer commented: “This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers (mostly at workplaces or toilets) and ‘knows themselves as cows’.
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the milk industry.
At the end of the advertisement, women of the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps in their breast vests as they were made.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
Instead, the elvie pump is completely silent, it has no wires and hoses, and it is an unobtrusive fit for breast-feeding, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even go out during the pumping.
Ana Balar, a partner and artistic director of the Mother advertising agency commented: “Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned bold and provocative entry on the market.
By putting on breast-feeding mothers and lypsy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of breast pump into light, we brought a new pump of incredible freedom in a entertaining and consistent way.
The elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
In London fashions, the mother of two children appeared on catwalk as designer Marta Jakubowski lived using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silences
The number of migrants who have been targeted has also grown sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the difficulties in investing children in foster families as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump regime.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of paperless migrants, and registration as a family may endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential replacement families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, high-level entry and customs authority, last week at Congress, proved that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minors.
The Office later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been in the criminal records before.
“In the country, 80% of people who are either members of the local family or members of their households are illegal, and a large part of them are criminals foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people, Albence says.
In order to address children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which in some cases the case must be dealt with in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than the 60-day period previously used, the staff of the reception centre will state.
Many prefer to appear through a video conference rather than personally when they are driving the case to the court on the matters of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to help will be immediately expelled.
According to reports published in the last months by the employees of the reception centres and the system, the time spent in child imprisonment affects whether children start to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent landings or escape attempts.
According to the lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as the Towerillo, where signs of child despair can be missed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that children are moved to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from traumas.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moualem, who also acts as a Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country using the excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that \"he is going to work with him in accordance with it\"
“They must withdraw immediately, and without a word, he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war against terrorism is almost over – in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and after that, and millions of people have fled their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight until the whole Syria has been cleansed of both terrorist organizations and foreign troops.
The United States has about 2 000 soldiers placed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad opponents.
France has invested in fighting to tear over 1,000 soldiers into the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions were good for returning and accused some of spreading Western-irraditional fears, which encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
“We have invited the international community and relief organisations to facilitate these returns, ” he said.
\"They are politicising an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed on a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the massive attack of the Syrian troops supported by Russia in the area of which three million people live.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has clear time limits and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra, who will be destroyed.
The U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to gather the first meetings of the new government and opposition Committee in order to create and level up the post-war Syrian Constitution for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the revision of the existing Constitution’s pillars, and warned us not to interfere.
Why Trump Be Selected for Another Age
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many viewers from the liberals are likely to wish, launch and scandal to end his presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic decision of the presidential term.
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
After 2014, the best viewing time figures have doubled with CNN 1,05 million and almost tripled with MSNBC 1.6 million.
According to Fox News, Nielsen has an average of 2.4 million viewers compared to 1,7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: top readings of 3.5 million viewers in the main news fairs.
\"This is a crime that attracts people, because it is something we do not understand, the main producer of the ABC Designed Survivor programme, Neal Baer, notes of the Minister who will be president of the attack's destroyed Congress building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comedy writer and a book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said: “Because he makes me laugh, Scovell says.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well
Of course, unlike other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is going to get the members of the immigrant families to each other and how the world economy can do.
Inevitability is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the duties of a well-known citizen to look at six hours of expert panel claiming the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strip-striped pilot project (Washington Post says, \"of the perpetuity of the workpiece and the consequences of the uncollected descriptions of the Trump's anatomy of Stormy Daniels.

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, he was at the Farai North Coast having a lovely sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while he was laughing at CNN.
He was unable to get rid of the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and the future of the Supreme Court.
I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr. Fleiss told us.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Out of the way, it's going to be a lot of money for a big snack fight.
It is not surprising that the 17th election district in Pennsylvania has faced a real flow of money, since the reorganization of the congress elections will lead to two candidates already elected to fight from one place.
This recently-limited district of Pittsburgh is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who was found in the second electoral district in last spring's special elections.
Lamb competes with the second elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th election district in Pennsylvania, who is in overlap with the new 17th election district.
The division of the region was restructured after the highest court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old constituencies would favour Republicans against the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th electoral district has been launched in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name was widely known in Pennsylvania after the special elections in the 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The place had been in Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the area by 20%.
Political commentators have taken up a fine front for the Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew its intentions.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the low reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Panaman, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's management team.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call back American diplomat leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama based on a non-recognisable policy, according to which Taiwan will no longer be recognised, said Heather Nauert’s statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars of assistance from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and mental crime.
As internal meetings took place, the North and Central America authorities postponed the high level meeting on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in the companies to prevent migrants from seeking to join the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was intended to progress and this effectively decided on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
The Vice President, Mike Pencen, is now expected to give a sign to the meeting scheduled in mid-October on what kind of weight it will give to the administrative assembly, diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned in all silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new old messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton's White House informant refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, and there were two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters with you anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Mr Robert Mueller, President Trump, on the possibility of preventing the right, which is now very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported as a leading investigation into whether Trump's campaign was in secret in cooperation with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just when preparing for it to go back to his constituents and possibly be condemned as being compared.
There are a lot of whispers here, and I do not mean that the loss of President Trump would be inevitable - more than the loss of similar persons in Europe.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to eat from Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the passing years of bloodshed.
The course of history goes on to such turning points where the undefeated march of democracy is either rising or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been embroiled since he became aware that he had proposed the recording of the President's speech and considered the President's possible inability to deal with his mission.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
“How do we react if the newly required FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh’s activities is not complete or fair - or if he is established as a member of the Supreme Court in spite of the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we voting for a Congress that holds President Trumpi responsible?
If we fail to do this, our democracy will be long and dark in the winter.

Rangers Graham Dorans as an optimist for meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers will meet at his home on the Rapid Viento Thursday, knowing that, in the previous month, after a match against Villarreal in Spain, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to the G section of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a poncho for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer, ” says a 31-year-old player.
We went to the game with the prospect that we could get something and bring it to us.
Maybe we could've caught him at the end of the win, but everything on the line is probably a fair result.
They must have been better during the first half of the day, and we got to the other side and we were better.
Thursday is another important night in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with this set we can give us everything we can and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can now push full, leave the past season behind us and succeed.
Fear of pension savings takes women's night naps
Although the participants in the study had a clear vision of how they wished to take care of themselves, only few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the field study said that they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents reported that they had spoken to their children about it.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but they do not take the initiative,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you tell me about your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional person and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in costs.
Take economic advice into the debate: advice can also help us to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for these costs or self-employed insurance, if you can afford it.
Download legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative in place so that you can name a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you can't communicate with them.
Consider, too, the drawing up of a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine the person you trust to take care of the financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them.
Remember, too, small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.

Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the victim count is expected to grow.
Since communications are out of reach, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the north of Dongala County, which is closer to the height of 7.5 magnidated lakes.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palusta and Dongala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawes province, located at the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, an estimated 379 800 in 2017.

The price of nickel is also important, but it has focused on the opposite coast of the Sulawes in Morowa.
According to Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalaan have hit several tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996 nine people were killed in the West of Dongka.
Indonesia is based on an active Pacific Ring of Fire region and often suffers earthquakes.
I've had some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia caused a tsunami that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.

2016: The earthquake struck the Aceh Pidie Jaya region, causing destruction and panic when people remember the enormous damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died when the buildings were torn.
2018: The powerful earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The oldest son of former Governor Alaska and Vice President Track Palin has been arrested for imprisonment.
According to the Alaskan police Saturday report, Pali, 29 from Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence and the prevention of domestic violence and opposition in the context of arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a woman's cell phone with him when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.

He's also accused of a class B infringement that can be sentenced to a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
Palin isn't the first time accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of being assaulted by his father, Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and informed them that he was being punished.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaska veteran right.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting his face.
The Veteran groups criticise Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining his son’s violent behavior with a traumatic stress disorder caused by the service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have been killed after the earthquake hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
In his power, 7.5 magnited earthquakes caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are out of reach and the victim count is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the middle of Sulawes, to the north of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
In social media, they're running videos at the time of the strike.
Hundreds of people had met at the ranching elections Please in town when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of eight human lives in New York City, which is a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to the charges, Saipov, 30, was using Home Depot's rental car in his October hit on the West Side Highway bike where he was riding on pedestrians and bikers.
According to the report on the application for the death penalty for the New York southern administration, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov killed on an ad hoc basis, eight victims and caused, on an objectively, serious physical injury.
According to the Court of Justice, both of these charges may be subject to the death penalty.
weeks after the attack, federal law imposed a 22-by-year charge on Saipov, involving eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and there were also charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required some remarkable planning and preparation, the prosecutors pointed out and described the way Saipov carried out his actions to be “horrific, cruel and shameful. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alessandro Damian Pagnucco.
Of the victims, five were Argentinan tourists.
The previous time, when the right of the southern administration of New York has been sentenced to death, has passed a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to lifelong imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last implemented in New York in the federal case in 1953, when married Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union during a cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the case-law, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of regret in the days and months that followed.
He told the investigators he did it very well, the police told me.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to get his hit after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He was charged with 22 individual charges. He was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence lawyers representing Saipov, said that the defence was very disappointed - the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to call for a death penalty and for no recognition and life-long release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma to those involved in these events, ” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked him not to be required of the death penalty.
The Conservative representative says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage promised today in protest against the conservatives to mobilize the civilian army.
The former President of Ukip said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of the Members of Parliament of Theresa May proposed that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Commissioner Peter Bone, the Conservatives, told the marchers in Birmingham, that the UK would already be outside if Farage were a brexit secretary.
But May encounters the deep division of its lines in agreeing to a challenge, which is underlined by the conservatives on the ground of the stay, which were involved in a separate demonstration against brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister is campaigning to keep Chequers-compression proposal on the ground in the repression of breakers and opponents, and in the EU.
The supporters called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a setback, and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leaveh event, in Solihull, that he wanted to \"stoe the Chequers proposal to go,\"
He proposed that Farage be involved and that this should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
Wellingborough's representative added: \"I am brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal.
He presented his EU response, saying: “We did not fight the world war to become subjects.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country.
Bone took the view that the public opinion would have changed since the vote in 2016: “The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to remain is a completely flawed argument.
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of brexite, also took part in the march and said to the journalists: “Just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party or the activists who are really going to the streets and are, at all, responsible for our success.
Step aside from the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message addressed to May, he added: “The ministers will be allowed to keep their work when they keep their promises...
Farage said that politicians should be under pressure if they intend to pass out the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about trust between the people and the political class, he said.
\"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it.
When speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians, who are about to pass on a brexite, to feel the pressure on your body.
\"We are going to mobilise the army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-government and proud state.
In the meantime, the supporters marched through Birmingham before the two-hour opportunity to be held in the city centre.
A small number of activists were waving out the \"Tories Against Brexit\" tickets. The group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party application at the beginning of the meeting.
These are the people who say that they can get IT systems well and all the technology for Canadian plus plus plus plus, and undisputed border operations for free Irish trade, he added.
\"It's a total farce.
There's no good brexite, he added.

Arrest for the shooting of LSU Sims
Louisiana Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that he was arrested by a person suspected of being the LSU basketball player from Wayde Sims' death on Friday shooting.
The Baton Rouge police announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 on his arrest at 11 a.m. at the ET conference.
The police had published a video on Friday's shooting scene and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot to the head and killed as a result, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports.

Simpson admitted that he was in the interrogations, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do anything to arrest the resistance, and he was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team's arrangements offer him victory on Sebastian Vettel
When Valtter Bottos passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it turned out that the Mercedes team arrangements are of major importance to competition.
Bottas got a good run out of the boat and left Hamilton almost his own fortune in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling his teammates.
Vettel went to the shelter first and left Hamilton to drive a set of tails that should have been resolved.
Mercedes went round the hall later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a little contact and the Ferrari driver turned counter-responsively from the internal line by refusing to defend his investment after two thirds of his movement.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started on his backs and was on the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition while extending the exchange of tyres, aiming at a quick stop and taking the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
In the end, he came to the hall on the 44th round, but he was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds while taking Räikkösen in fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtter was doing a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me by.
The team has made an extraordinary career, reaching double victory, said Hamilton.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's claim that he did not pour out Christine Blaly Ford's letter to the public, which accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of the sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh.
When speaking on a occasion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Senate, but said that what was going on in the Senate was an expression of human integrity, misconception and dishonesty.
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see the pain, the people who are angry, mean, shady and dishonest,” said the President.
“When we see publications and beddled things and then they say ‘well, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you yearning for this information?
Do you remember his answer... Years of the document... oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Our years... no, we didn't leak, he added a senator to the ground.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford Kavanaugh's accusations and the letter was poured out into the public in September, but Feinstein contested that the leak would have occurred in his office.
- I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story, and Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
\"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes...
But his prohibition was not acceptable to the President, who commented on it on Saturday’s occasion: “I wish you could see that was very bad for the body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my body language.
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual harassment by three women, and thought that the accusations used by the Democrats for their own benefit.
They've decided to get back to power by any means they can.
You see that evil and evil, and they don't care who they hurt, or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule, Mediaite reports the President's words.

In Micronesia, representatives of an airline flying into the lagoon in the Pacific are now telling us that one person is lost, even though, according to earlier notice, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.

Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. came to an end with a re-treatment in which a man was accused of smoking a woman of missionaries in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the data stored on the mobile phone when gathering one of the movements of Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers at the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett told me that he had received a number of mobile phone location data showing Tellis had been in violation of his previous claim with Chambers on the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the texts, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He wiped her out of her life, Hale said.
The final lines of the defence are planned to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.

Another dark one?
The New York nurse will sue the couple for a racist text message.
The New York nurse is challenging the couple's right to discriminate against after having accidentally received a text message from the mother of the child, which complains that she is a \"tale\",
The couple is denying that they are racist and are opposed to the “discriminate ” challenge.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed the trouble when the new nanny Giselle Maurice came to work on her first working day in 2016 and she was told that this was dark.
“EIIIII, THE TAAS TOMUNIC,” plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband a text message.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice twice.
When he realized the mistake he made, Plasco-Flaxman, according to the New York Post, had resigned Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had been received by his African-American nanny had handled his work badly, and he had been waiting for Filipinos this time.
Maurice received a fee from one working day and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple's right to pay for the divorce and wants to pay $ 350 a day for six months, where he was originally washed up to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that, ” said the Post magazine on Friday and added: “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple has responded to the racist allegations, saying that the decision to conclude a career relationship with Maurice was a valid solution because they could not rely on him after he offended him.
My wife sent her something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racist, Joel Plasco told us about the Post interview.
But would you leave your child in the sight of a person you have been unfriendly to, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really.
Plasco compared the challenge to blackmail and said that his wife had received a baby two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
- Should we go after someone in such a situation?
It's not very comfortable done, but the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple’s social media, including their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the public would not identify with the talking bear.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the book was approved, says of the letter: “It’s hard to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's amusing now that the huge popularity of Paddton is known...
I would say that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication seemed bitter because his father died last year.
Pgradtonon, he described it as a very important family member, and said his father was still proud of its success.
“ He was a pretty quiet man, and he was not a very good type at all, ” she says.
“But since Paddton was so real to him, it was almost as a child’s achievement to him; one you are proud of, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced the success of Paddton in that way.
Even though it was about his creation, he always gave the honor to Pgyton himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was attached to a plane landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
“They made a little difference and told me that the situation is really bad, that he was not expected to survive,” says Ednan-Laperous.
Then they called and said that my daughter would die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.
The medications that allowed doctors to keep their heart on the move gradually removed from his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now he's all gone out.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, the loss of his daughter, Ednan-Laperous, ascended into an airplane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trial he was currently going through.
No one knew, he said.
I kept my head down, and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
The women who are dying send cards to stop suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a telephone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I would not want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day, ” he said.
Davis, 45 in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious sneezing.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room.
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in a dark state.
In 2014 Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his life away from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the after-effects.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people that you can go talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years of co-operation shortly after his mother was dead.
He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that, Humphreys said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his conduct.
He was right in the country on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their presents, he took no eye contact or anything like it.
He states that Mark’s death was a difficult trauma to them, but they still have to go on: “It will break the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is move on and fight forward.
If you fight with your help, you can call Samaritans for free at 116 123 (Iso-UK and Ireland), send an e-mail to already@samaritans.org or visit the website.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake when the FBI launches its investigation
“I thought that if we could really do what he wanted, in time and scale, for a limited investigation, we might be able to achieve a little unity,” she said on Saturday, and added, she was afraid that the committee would be cutting off.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
In contrast, it is a matter of timing.
The elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court of the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to give them support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI report has been prepared?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game across and strengthen his choice of Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean locusts falls during Kim
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people in South Korea's North Korea has decreased after seven years in power from Kim Jong-un.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean unitation department and reported that there had been an accident in 1 127 last year in 2011 in 2 706.
According to the Park, there have been decisive factors for tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increases in prices for human transporters.
Pyongyang has not been made publicly.
The majority of North Korean lobbies are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
From Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have gone across the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most escape via China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a strongly protected delimitarised zone between the Koreos.
China treats dragons as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and, most of all, restores them by force.
Yet, technically speaking, North Korea and South Korea’s relations in war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, countries' leaders met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the negotiations at the stops to break the nuclear armament.
This followed the historic meeting of June, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general level of effort towards the nuclear non-proliferation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho called the United States for sanctions to settle after the meeting.
“No confidence in the U.S., our national security is on the ground and under such circumstances, we do not, in any case, engage unilaterally to break down our equipment first,” said Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a 'hysterer' and is incompatible with the Supreme Court.
The minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaughta as a 'hystererer', said it was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your game commented on this in Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called ‘hysterer’, ” said Pelosi of her own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate before the Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasay Fordia while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the hands of his feelings, and sometimes he cried out and lost his speech when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling himself \"groteksk\" and \"planned person\" for persecution against the Hillary Clinton President-in-Office of 2016.
Your fear said that he believed that Kavanaugh's witness statement shows that this is not capable of acting in the highest court, because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
“I believe that he made himself incompetent in his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats, ” said Pelosi.
Your fear was when she was asked whether she would be charged with Kavanaugh if this choice was confirmed and if the Democrats were to have a majority in the House of Representatives.
We say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only qualified for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is currently working, Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the US Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugh was concerned about the possible provisions on health reform or Roe v Wade, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judicial officer.
In his consultations on his conviction, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
\"It is not the right time for a hysterical and partial person to be elected a member of the court and we would be expected to say that it is wonderful,\" Pelosi said.
Women need to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech when months and years of rage over and over, and it is not allowed to cry.
We're here when we're angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, or whatever you think it is.
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speaker in a situation where she got angry and started crying: ‘ You may think I’m sad now because I cry.
I'm really mad.
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears get the right as a path of disabling, even though they are generally misinterpreted.
One of the most interesting memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is that once I cried out of speechless rage and older woman - a cold-hearted superior I had always been afraid - grabbed me from the neck and dragged me to the staircase.
- Don't ever let them see you cry, he said.
They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they got you hurt.
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart stayed in 1987 on an out-of-marital relationship on a boat called Mickey Business and got out of the race, very frustrated Schroeder's message that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
“It was not a very well thought-out decision, ” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
\"The candidates were already seven and the least were needed one more.
Someone called the situation \"Lumiki and the seventh dwarf.\"
Since the campaign time was already long, he was behind the fund-raiser, and so he announced he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave men a thousand dollars only gave him 250.
They're thinking that I'm getting something at a discount, and he's thinking.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he had to take over his feelings of gratitude to his supporters, a system of frustration, which made it so difficult to collect funds for the electoral work of voters and delegations, and the sex of anger that he could not speak.
You could've thought I'd get a nervous breakdown, Schroeder would remember the press's reaction.
You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking my tombstone must be hacked into a monument.
‘He cried.’
How can the US and China War benefit Beijing?
The launch of the U.S. and China’s commercial war was ear-flying, and even though the fight is all but past, the country’s intervention can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
The U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the most important export articles in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant prevention took place this week with new customs duties affecting import resources for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion) effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has been responsible for the same size every time, last five out of ten percent of customs duties on US imports worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be impoverished for a moment.
In order for Washington to be retreated, it should be granted in its own requirements, but bowing to the public United States would be far too humiliated for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the US Trade War can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing its dependence between countries.
“The political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start an economic downturn in a number of countries, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than the bystanders have understood so far,” says Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tanks.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to return to the refugees.
Syria says that he is ready to volunteer for the refugee return and to ask for help to rebuild the country after a devastating war of over seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country will improve.
\"You are now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they had to leave because of terrorism and their daily lives and the unilateral economic activities affecting their living.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won 2018 Ryder Cup at the end of the United States team at 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National Square outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in Europe, and it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points, which were needed to win the United States.
The American star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost all the time in the tournament and he hit his first shot in the water on the 16th route of par-3-rada, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italy Molinari was great in all tours and he became one of the four players who had received the result from 5-0 since the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with a result of 5&4 European team's lowest-pulled player against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, was lost to 2 and 1 Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight out of Ryder Cup golf veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European in all time at a total of 25,5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to gain this victory.
It is a team and I am glad that I could be of assistance, said that Garcia moved to the European team after the victory.
He's moving the ring to his own countryman Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend at Tiger Woods's 2&1 individual competitions on Sunday.
\"I feel a tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods. \"I grew up admiring him,\" said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now he's holding Ryder Cup on 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the best players in the past, who's won 14 big profits and left only Jack Nicklause.
The U.S. team had trouble finding roads all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high-level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team, Captain Jim Furyk, said after his team failed: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressed the European team in the games this morning.
We're in trouble.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're back in the group, working with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm gonna have to pick up the hat.
We met our winner.
