I got your message.
I just met an old friend.
I recognized his face.
I suggest you learn French.
I'm out like a paradise.
I rejected the offer.
I regret visiting Australia.
I'm resting.
I remember both of you.
I remember that too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I remembered him for his duty.
I respect Tom.
I'll retire in four years.
I risked my ass for you.
First cast these shirts out.
I'll run faster than you.
I run about eight kilometers a day.
I'm running.
I've won the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna work.
I said no.
Thank you.
I was sitting there staring.
I'm sitting next to him.
I've been sitting down to think.
I've been sitting down to think.
I was sitting next to the driver.
The tomato fruit or the vegetables?
I was sitting on the ground.
I saw a bear drive a truck.
I saw a bear go with a truck.
I saw a really good movie last weekend.

I saw it.
I saw the car explode.
I saw them.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
I saw Thomas today.
I saw your name on the list.
I was sneaking out of the sink.
I was secretly hoping this would happen.
I've been photographing it.
I secretly photographed him.
I see a house.
I see a lion.
I see a nobleman and a noble lady.
I don't see him enough.
I can see that.
I see what you're thinking.
I've been snooping danger.
I sent you flowers.
I served with Tom at the special forces.
I put the table for six people.
I put it on six.
Is everyone all right?
Is everyone here?
“ Is everyone talking about me? ” No, Tomi, you are not that important.
It's all right in the office.
Is everything ready?
The fast food is really unhealthy?

Do your schools teach French?
Is your tongue French?

Is he sick or is he a doctor?
American?
Are you crying?
Is he my friend?
He's tall?
I was shaking my hand with Tom, and I went.
I was shaking my head.
I should go there.
I should have asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should have been at the meeting.
I should have been there at the meeting.
I should've been more cooperative.
I should have been more precise.
I should have been more thorough.
I should have been there sooner.
I should have brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should have done that last week.
I should've done this somewhere else.
I should have done that with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I never should have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should have refused to do that.
I should have seen this coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have expected that.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I'm busy.
I'm screaming, but no one can hear me.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is that a bird?
Is it okay if I call you Tom?
Is that a wolf?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is this dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to speak esperanos?
Final?

Is it true Tom committed suicide?
Is it true Tom killed himself?
Is it true that in a week, you learned to be an esperanto?
Is it true you threw me on Tomi's daughter's request?
Is it true you like salt coffee?
Is it time?
The fruit juice is more affordable than coffee?
I'm skiing in the winter. I'm swimming in the summer.
Laurie dundi?
I'm sleeping with two pillows.
I slept an hour after midnight last night.
I'm asleep. I'm late for school.
I slept nine hours.
I used to hang out with my boss.
I've got the turkey on.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Is Monday gonna be okay?
Do I understand?
I took a picture.
I'm getting into the house.
I'm getting into the house.
I'm sick of it.
Is it okay now?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it a stomach fissure?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
Sometimes I sleep.
Is Paris far away?
I'll talk to you in Dutch.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I speak a little Hungarian.
I'm gonna speak Russian a little.
I'm talking a little Russian.
I'm a little Russian.
I speak French almost every day.
I speak French and English.
I'm talking to Spanish.
I've been with him all day.
I've been with them all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I spent all the money I had to buy the book.
I've been going around for an hour until I realized where I needed to go.
I spent the initial phase of my life in an incubator.
I spent the initial phase of my life in an incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I spent the whole day in front of my plane.
I've been sitting here three years for crimes I haven't committed.
I've been sitting for three years for something I haven't done.
I told you too early.
They're gonna put Citrusket castles on my bread.
Is it rain water?
Russia is part of Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is that your mom?
Is it very close to Sicilia Mda?
Today I've been staring at papers all day, and now I'm tired.
I was beginning to doubt his claim in truth.
I stayed.
The tea is more expensive than milk?
Is it licensed?
Is that all your change?
Secret?
Is that right?
Is that deliberate?
Is that being in the picture or is it photographed there?
Is that being in the picture or is it on it?
Is that my mug?
Is this in the papers?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Do you have a scientific basis for this?
Did you count on anything like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is that the problem?
Right?
But is that true?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the cat on the chair or under it?
Is the beach clean?
Is the race that bad?
Is the microphone turned on?
The museum is open today?
Is there a doctor on board?
Is there a free place?
Do you have a subway in your city?

Is that valuable?
Is this your home love?
Is that what you call home love?
Is that your girlfriend?
Is that your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one more or two more things to be put in the suitcase.
I still need breakfast.
I still think this is the best choice.
Tom Christian?
Tom's cooking well?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?
Tomi's alive?
“ Tom American? ” No, Canadian.
Tomi will come over to us this afternoon?
Tom's dead?
Is Tom in?
You're left-handed, aren't you?
Tom's lost?
Tom Mary's son?
Tom ready?
Thomas's still sick?
I've been standing with him.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I learn about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you've already packed up and ready to go.
I must have heard that voice somewhere.
I swear I'll make you pay for this.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Do you feel better about your daughter?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
That affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take your place.
I go on a train every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You're better off with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
He's got a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be sweet.
It would be a shame to see all the work wasted.
He's obviously upset.
He didn't break.
I wasn't bad.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
There's no such thing as snow.
He'll let you come.
You're not doing anything!
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I'm teaching Chinese.
It's like they're pouring it on me.
I found out slowly that I misunderstanded him.
It's been snowing the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.
That was just the day of our marriage, honey.
There must have been a reason for this.
Suddenly, it happened.
That's what happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes.
It's happening to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
You've got your own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should have a diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's been a couple of movies.
I think I can.
I don't think I can kill him.
I don't think I could kill him.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel like I'm better.
I think I've got the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It was like I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's a very small probability, in my opinion, that you're going to be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it is.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you'd better go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor could have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I don't think something's right.
I'll find the spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I do.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tomi's hot.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can deal with it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all stuck.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know the name of Thomas' girlfriend.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you got it wrong.
I think you should go in personally.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a really good job.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't so convincing.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went somewhere to eat, it would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head would explode.
I've thought about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under her influence.
It had a big impact on me.
This is dangerous!
It's an historic play.
It's hard to put it into practice.
It's hard for everyone to feel comfortable.
It's hard for everyone to please.
I have doubts if it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
Actually, it's your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's amazing.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke signal cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
It's not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom's got a problem with.
Not so expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk full of mouth.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him to do.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
There's a lot of heat at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after you change the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
He'll be ready when he needs it.
He'll be ready until he has to.
It'll take some time to wear your glasses.
He'll knock you down soon.
It'll work if I change the polars.
So it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need me here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you don't feel good here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
It could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it out.
Maybe I'm gonna be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
They must have stolen it.
We need to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
Even though I lied to her, I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question, too.
I used to bathe for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I was on the 58th route.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke yesterday morning.
It fell yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I cross-countryed the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to put it down.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life, too.
I'll keep trying to get to know you.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
He's a big-ass cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
This is a nice and good theory, but is this going to work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 a.m.
One of my dreams was always that I was living next to a stream.
It's always the same story.
It's a environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame!
I'm sorry I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big weirdo.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
It's just as art as science.
It's already in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport where a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's an old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a rainy day.
It's a tough day.
That's what happened earlier.
It wasn't any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's the best night to kick the garden.
Fire drill.
Yeah.
It's better to get on a bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
I'm cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get a sweater?
It's common knowledge that the bear likes honey.
No matter if Tom did it or didn't.
It's perfectly normal.
It's okay.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep in here.
That's delicious!
It's ready!
It's easier not to start than stop.
It's easy to be brave from far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks very strange.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks like you're being honest with me.
Looks like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's a shame to miss a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Dear.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting tough.
We're gonna have a tough time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a body star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
I'm glad you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to conclude that.
It's hard to believe the time has been clean and sunny all this time.
It's hard to write.
It's hard to find a bench in this town where you can sleep.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to say with words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's very nice.
He's got a very big head.
High.
The kids are in bed now.
Stop talking about money.
It's hotter than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important for parents to stand on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those who get in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You need to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
I don't know what it's gonna bring tomorrow.
Unbelievable, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just keep moving.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
It's washing today.
It's like a sub-sea field, and turtles over them and sharks like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how she lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
It won't happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negociated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not important what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't say anything to you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't make any sense to the priest if you don't testify guilty.
It doesn't make any sense to get in the past.
Snow's coming.
It's obviously broken.
Obviously impossible.
Obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's fine if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ It's been three months, and Tomi already says that she speaks France liquidly. ”
It's only three days.
The park's on the other side.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's as if I'm pouring out of the dynasty.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's very convincing.
It's very simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of this mizantrop theories is to report in the study of the working class, leaving imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars he has gloomed, and that he believes the core of the thought that the causes of endless wars are the causes of man’s aggressive tendencies.
It's just urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
Few large gardens are located in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
That's what it is.
It's a bad thing to ask someone how much he's making.
They say the Czech girls are nice.
They say they're about to leave Tokyo.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
In theory, it's possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time for us to pick up our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time for us to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should cut my hair.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time for us to do something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tomi has a word against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this.
Too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about.
It's typical autumn time.
The cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's disgusting yellow and it's not harmonised with anything, but at least they don't get gas in the dark!
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
Now it's up to them.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Very attractive.
Very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
It's very fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very nice of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
To learn a language thoroughly, there is a need for some 10,000 hours to learn.
It's got to be a part of success.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
We're all looking forward to it.
It took me an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took more than a month to get better from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but it finally managed to find it.
I turned into a little alley.
I've been poking.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was wrong to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a silly question.
That was a stupid idea.
This was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was so strange.
It was a wonderful day.

It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
