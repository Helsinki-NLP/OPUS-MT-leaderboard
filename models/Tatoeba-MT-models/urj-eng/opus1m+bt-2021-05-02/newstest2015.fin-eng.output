Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiova of refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At this moment, the Kiev leadership does not want to engage in any relevant political debate with the eastern part of his country, Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiova and West are said to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their places where Putin said the Ukrainian army were shooting civilians.
The aim of the Militarians is to push these armed forces away and their cannons so that they can't shoot the residents of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmic plant.
It surprised me that the crew came from the beginning of the night.
The visitors were expected in two days, says Promotor Tom Kangas.
Wallajaki Hiphop Festival was organised for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop-festars, which means poppy's not in authorisation, Kangas assures us.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday, restricting the acquisition of explosives.
In future, individuals must seek permission from the police administration to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
These substances include hydrogen oxide, nitromethane, nitrogenic acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing these if the determined concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen oxides are present in cleaning and detergents, but their concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
For example, nitromethane is used during the acceleration period.
However, substances obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valoliga: Super Raheem parasite - Mario remained in the shadow - Eleoliga - Night-Sanomat
Raheem Sterling, a 19-year-old, showed again why he was considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lanella had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, who was confirmed at Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from its top stream.
The Italian lost three high-quality goal locations and fed only half of its six feeds to their own team.
A player who has already popularized half of the players expect better in the future.
Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers planted the role of Luis Suarez in the team along with Daniel Sturrridge.
Instead of the Balotell, the team was targeted by Raheem Sterling, the top of the middle field, who threw a 3-0 win-win opening painting by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just working.
The Englishman from Balotelli, 20 cents shorter, is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
Features are not common to a player who is most grateful to the lawn for an hour's speed of about 34 km.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the North Pole told me how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from a bulletin in Wembley's roots.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief captain of the Helsinki City Orchestra.
The City Hall of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next master of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The papers on the Los Angeles Times have been asking what orchestra he's gonna take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells us that she will start her new assignment with joy and pride.
The City Orchestra of Helsinki has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, including by holding a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestras have led the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation, he says.
Administrations of employees' organisations in pension negotiations - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, pension negotiations are looking for a new pace for social organisations' own gatherings.
The management of the SAK, the A programme and the STK will be taking place in the morning.
After that, real pension negotiations are to be continued.
Labour market organisations have, among other things, called for a dispute about the commitment of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisation has promised to work by autumn, but the latest estimate suggests that it would be born during this week.
- It's a pit.
Rovaniemelinen Women's Flying Ball league Woman Volley tripped the league to the vampire athletes in the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula turned five of the narrowed games into 3-2 winnings.
The last round of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead all the time.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and in the passport game Vampula was slightly better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkkyrö.
The WoVo's sixth was a bitch that 190-cent American engineer Jennifer Keddy had his back stuck on the side.
As a center, Sara Niemi played.
In Karoliina Kyllönen, despite his thumb injury, he was playable and formed a combination with Johanna Pekris, the most powerful combination of WoVo.
The hacking Jenna Centralmäki was able to make room for Jana Jaudzem for the last 1.5 times.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian passport and a libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo went as far as possible.
The preparation of WoVo too will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to the training camp for Rovaniem.
The team will meet on Saturday at 18 p.m. in a formal training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet at the sports school for another time.
Lidl takoo huats in Finland
Over the financial year ending in February, the net sales of Finnish companies grew by almost 25 per cent to almost EUR 1.2 billion.
The company published their income data on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 shops in Finland and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also reported that last year's tax on Finland paid almost EUR 14 million.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4 200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often reported in rare populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and reduced access to treatment.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video for honoring her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers went through the patient data of more than 1100 women who received ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were women.
The main investigator from the Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in few populated and remote areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
PIENI TOURE: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, at the time of her age diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also contributed to the possibility of survival.
In older women and cancer, the likelihood of survival at the time of the more widespread diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in rare and remote areas died 20% more likely during the investigation than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to establish why women living outside cities have a lower likelihood of survival of ovarian cancer, but Jordan considered possible delays in diagnosis and relief.
“Gynecological oncology specialists take care of this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities,” says Jordan.
Although treatment as remote services is becoming more widespread and the importance of distances is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that doctors can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients who are far away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is low, regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a family mother living in Gold Coast, was found to have a malignant ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemen wants to strengthen the station-style hockey park in the Friends Park, which is located next to the hotel in Pohjanov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Company Park and its immediate environment would be set up by Osvati, a service point to be publicly seen.
Opinions from the Environment Board and the Lapp’s centre of residence are requested from the proposed proposal.
As a result of a change in the status quo, the city wishes to allow the continuation of the motor racing activity related to tourism in the region.
It is meant to form a park area that holds within the present area of friendship park and between it and the river.
During the period from 15 November to 30 April, no more than 200 snowmobiles shall be permanently available on the spot.
The area may also be subject to refuelling points for the specified part.
Maintenance is also permitted in the new park area.
The city of Rovaniemen has rented the Ytility Park area for safari companies during winter.
The lease agreement has been renewed last spring 2014 and the agreement is in force in spring 2018.
There has also been strong opposition from anti-circumventive activities and changes in design.
The inhabitants of neighbouring crime groups have been in need of sounding as much as they are concerned about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been examined and there have been no evidence of cross-compliance with the guidelines.
Even the upgraded equipment is much more low-emission than the old equipment.
The park of friendship is also supported by the fact that, if the place of departure is to be moved further, hotel safari customers should be transported to safari slots on buses that are expected to be 15 departures a day.
The area of friendship park and the surrounding environment, according to the city, are also sufficiently wide for the reels, better than the places for replacement starting places, such as the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location even because the activities can expand in the future, for example, in the region of the Ounaspavilion.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemen, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by providing sufficient quality areas for places that are logistically and functionally affordable.
The friendly park is also marked as the starting point for motor-rolling, a sub-general of the centre, which has not yet received legal force.
The decrease of ownership buildings is seen in garden stores
The reduction in the number of housing owners, especially in the group under 35 years of age, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores in tens of millions, when today's young consumers reach their age on behalf of the horticural Trade Association (HTA) survey.
According to the Financial Times report, housekeepers use only 55 per cent of the amount of money they use for garden care.
The study also showed that more and more people are living in very urban dwellings with no gardens. Furthermore, the garden’s size is reduced when the front yard is increasingly covered into a parking lot, and these factors also threaten the garden sector with estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In London, housing ownership has decreased from 61% to 43% in six years, and there garden products are least used per household in the whole country.
According to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in housing rental or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The RHS’s leading garden advice, Guy Barter, says, is that, for example, plants grown in transferable crops are particularly popular among housing providers, as such types of farming can, if necessary, be included in their changes.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the period of accumulation in the garden sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will become more difficult this year, thanks to better weather conditions, since last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey is interviewing US diplomat for spying report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat report on spying by the Americans and the British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Ambassador's agent and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The Intercept has written that the documents leaked by the former German Analyst Edward Snowden by the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal Turkey as the main spying target of US and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all the large countries have held up each other.
The previous report on spying in Ankara, Germany’s main intelligence service, gave a more angry reaction to the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
In several success stories, Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze has been attached to the main part of a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen's movie at 2 nights in the morning, whose descriptions start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best female award for the Cannes Film Festival in his film Barbar Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film in Munich and Julian Schnabel's film in Perhone's glass suit.
Two nights in the morning, the man's head of the film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will receive Finland’s first night in September 2015.
Mallorcan Magaluf Police Chief in charge of corruption
The complainants submitted evidence of a blackmail by police and Calvià mayors at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Calvià Police Chief of Mallorca is arrested for a wet celebration following the corruption charges presented by traffic and bar owners in the Magluf region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in prison after several Punta Ballena traffickers presented corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena street is located in the majority of the Magaluf bars and night clubs.
According to the newspaper Mallorca Diario published on the website, the case was provided by evidence of a blackmail by police and Calvià officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corgemony's office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are interviewed by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC in the whole country wrote about the neutrality of the hated authorities of the night club owners, which made a significant contribution to their business.
“There is no more money in this case, but the fact that we can survive,” said one of the business owners to the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Alaluf was in several countries in newspaper headlines this summer, when the online YouTube video was distributed, where a 18-year-old British holidayer used to have oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the humorous and uncontrollable use of the Malaluf holidayers by reducing the quantities of harmful, alcoholic pub crawlies.
In addition, Playhouse's night club, where the oral video was filmed, was set to be closed for a year, and a fine of EUR 55 000 was imposed on the night club owner and the pub crawl organiser Carnage.
Above all, in the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists, it has also become popular with the so-called Balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol use when people jump from balcony to balcony to pool.
The children of Israel will return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children returned to school on Monday in bomb shelters when the rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the war of Israel and Hamas for 50 days, and the schools remained closed when the area recovered from the battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombings in southern Israel's communities, but the tracks of battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south, the Pashosh daily home, the workers removed traces of chips from the walls and slides before children arrived in the building on the hit day home.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in the town school of the city called Saami, in the Caribbean, in the Israeli community.
Many children living in this area urgently need routines.
The daughter of Bart's 11-year-old Shani Bart thinks that coming back to school in a long time will seem strange.
“We’ve had some difficult times when we didn’t go home, ” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited his support at the Kibbuts near the Gaza border.
Before the beginning of the last week's ceasefire, thousands of people from the local communities of the border area of Saat had remained inside or left their homes for safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gazan front are suspicious of the return of Palestinian grenades killed by a 4-year-old son in the Community.
According to the Ministry of Education, ten fair families had not returned yet.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gazan border, which was subject to a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that:
Israel and Hamas agreed on the ceasefire to be in force last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' request to remove Israel's and Egypt's column and to reopen Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to take away Hamas' weapons and return the body of the Israeli soldier who fell in two wars.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, which says that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had sufficient evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including the Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly south.
In turn, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to cover more than 100 UN schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While ten thousand people were still in the shelters and when the battles continued, the school authorities moved the beginning of the school last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open and return to school, just like other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammed Amara, who lives in a sheltered school in Gaza.
According to the generally used meter, housing prices have risen to the greatest number of years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing in Australia’s capital apartments rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showed the RP data on Monday.
As a result of this increase, prices increased by 4.2 per cent during the summer, July and August period, i.e. more than in the months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen evenly around the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the following: the average price increase is five to six per cent.
The most vulnerable housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawles, the spring began in Australia increases the number of dwellings in sales in the coming months, which is a real test on the housing market.
“In view of the increase in the sales of auctioned dwellings, the generally lively sales pace and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the increase in housing prices will continue to increase over the next three months,” Lawles says.
The new Gösta Museum has held record conventions in Mäntta
The new museum and image art have attracted record audiences this summer to Mäntta.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there has been, among other things, pop art classic works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
In Mänttä's art week, he told me that he had made a visit on Monday, when 14 500 interested people visited the event this summer.
These figures have not been used.
The people have been stealing from the doors and windows, says President Pauli Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors of the year will be at Serlachius Museums this year to approach hundreds of thousands.
There have been some 40,000 visitors in previous years.
There are some 11,000 inhabitants in Mäntta-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
The museum director, Sivonen, reminds me that the new museums are always open as phenomena occur.
\"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,\" he says.
It is hoped that the season of art will continue far beyond the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened.
The police are investigating four thefts made in the last four days in Kajaan.
On Sunday night at Pohjolandu, a business building was broken by breaking the window.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cash machine.
Between Thursday and Monday on the Deep Road, fuel was stolen from the truck's tank.
The boat between Sunday and Monday and the boat with its rear engines had been taken from the boat’s boatport.
The rowboat was a fishball-marking outer light and the inside is floating.
In the inside, read the text on the top.
A couple of suspects stealing the police had the chance to catch up.
On Sunday night in the Tikkapuront, the business building was broken.
The police dog got a trace and a 20-year-old paltama man found himself hiding under the woods.
On Monday, the police picked up another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of being guilty of the same break.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan
The disappearance of ten grams of amphetamines led to the murder charge of the Canadian man who was born in 1977.
According to the D.A., the man had gone to the apartment with his open mate and the other man and shot him in the tomb as a drug exporter, who had suspected the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kayan woman.
The defendant contested the charge and claimed to be another man who was with him to be a shooter.
The case came into police when the police patrol stopped a passenger car that had been incinerated to burn the clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burnt gears, a cut shotgun was found in the car.
The Supreme Court of the Kainuu will give judgment later on.
In many places, life was rarely warm.
According to the Air Science Department, one warm August is repeated on average in ten years.
The statistics of the Institute of Air Sciences show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
Most of the country's deviation was one to two degrees.
The whole summer became warmer than usual because of the heel and August heels.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter looked at 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugs me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in Dudley, the traveling family from seven children in Jamaica in the United Kingdom's Midlands region in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on his father's visual discussion and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The sound is a mixture of reggate and raps in an upbeat taht.
Henry's had to go through the painful childhood memories.
He has often been in therapy since his mother's death, and he thinks much about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never visible, but his voice said, \"Stop noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the crucet now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a brewery or the beauty of a crucique dinner.
I never talked to him about things like that.
Most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal plant in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at that time.
The vents are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smokey, Labyrinth-like depths, where the flames, smoke and nod, and they remind me of that day.
The father used to go to the bath and just lie in the bath, and quietly he began singing to himself while washing the melt of the meltdown away from himself.
As I walked around the plant, I realized that he had been working on it for years to get us some food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite that, Henry’s childhood was missing the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before she died, we began to repeat to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a Billie-girl with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he had for himself as a child.
Do you have to repeat it all the time? I love you.
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother's death.
When I started suffering from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began with a lot of fitness, and I also had to start a rough diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After getting a lot of good feedback from critics about his role in Othello, he's drowned in making the theater.
The next round was the Erehdys comedy and August Wilson's Fences-Aids.
Making a theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedys that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field while he was only 16 years old at the factory.
One of the tigers found him on the stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces Championship.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s.
Henry learned how to work when he did it.
I was supposed to grow into an adult in the light of publicity, I had to learn how to produce jokes from slide straps in 1975 to 1985, while living for purpose and being on television, it was a difficult time.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had the right to play at The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared black-headed, so Henry ended up in a comic show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved in it, but I won't regret it.
Although my position was strange and horrific, I was able to work on enormous events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet, the prized, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment programme of the British TV was at the same time an uncanny parod of black people.
Henry worked in the '80s in the second comedy series, where they both made fun of and admired the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known as his character cook Gareth Blacklock at the comedy Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on advertisements, documents, TV series and film sections, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in 2008 he said to himself: \"What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that you are just on your trail or on your sidelines.
The next round was the Radio 4 documentary series – What's So Great About....
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always been trying to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not properly taught at our school, and I think it was part of a white middle class that uses stockings and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's topic raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, \"To see you.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 things about Othellolo's last speech for a document and he had been sold.
I felt I could do this.
It seemed almost like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
\"This is what we're talking about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do some background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon after that, Henry played the main role in the Erehdys comedy.
Suddenly I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I thought, \"Oh, you've changed,\"
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that he had his job to entertain the audience.
“A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the proposal would continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me would be so relieved.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it for the rest of us.
You're part of the play, stay in your role.
Henry-Fences show at the Duchess Theatre
It was a challenge to learn the part of the seasons.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign of the gods; “This is what you must do...
This is what Henry is saying, of course, with the voice of KUMALLA.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: small humor boys are constantly interrupting our discussions when they change from immitation to another.
The arrest of Stand-up is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to get immediate praise from an unknown public.
If you keep thirsting it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it doesn't inspire me the same way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to the new stand-up tour anymore.
To me, it brings real joy to sit with the director who will help shape the entire journey from the beginning, the mid-stage and the end, and I do not believe that I would ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reborn?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The play keeps telling the story, and I'm enjoying it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Keni will establish a register of officials to remove the damage workers.
Kenia has started to establish a biometric register of officials trying to remove \"immigration workers\" from the government's wage lists.
Workers who did not report to the register in the next two weeks would no longer receive remuneration were reported in the Government’s press release.
The government has doubts that thousands will continue to be paid after they have submitted their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to push the corruption of the public sector after entering office in 2013.
Previously, according to the audit carried out this year, \"at least a million dollars were spent in the month on dream workers' wages and other economic abuses.
The government has doubts that wages will be paid to the account after the person has died or left his post office, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register during the next few weeks at the ID centres in order to ensure that their data are stored in a biometric registration form, reported in the Government’s press release.
According to the information, everyone who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the pay lists.
“This measure makes the public sector a significant rationale, as it defines how many people are actually working and thus cleans wage lists at both levels of the government. This is how we solve the problem of \"immortal workers\", says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Ministry of Dispersion and Design.
The result of the financial year 2015 may remain EUR 25,5 million as a deficit unless the city adjusts its activities and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current draft budget, the annual figures are about 9.4 million deficits.
As a possible means of improving efficiency, there was a need to reduce the scope and level of services and to buy services, sell and grant assets, and increase tax and payment products.
The cost of investments is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the condition of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in government shares will further weaken the prospects.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous about achieving savings.
The ship must turn to the strategy's objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Government has also submitted proposals for preparation by the Management Group.
The proposals of the City Government are based on the budget preparation of the delegation at the Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After a delegation seminar, the draft budget will be moved to the City Government and the City Council through the committee.
Tens of Turkish police arrested as suspects against the government
All 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for crimes against the government, and local media sources tell us.
The police didn't comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 senior police officers in custody.
Some of the police were involved in last December's corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey on the organisation of a large criminal society and on the follow-up of phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan, who was the Prime Minister during that period, said that police activities were part of the Islamic leadership of Fethullah Gullen's activities against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditional day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yassenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that all schools had not reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremony of the first day of September was not held at every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All Ukraine, the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pasuthov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yasseyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn what will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is the traditional children’s written shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to the Texas Perry, the news was unauthorized.
The Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas was sent on Sunday night adoring picture of the Democratic District Attorney, in consultation with the Court of Justice, of the accusations of abuse of power.
Tweetti was later removed, followed by a new tweetti where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweetti was sent unauthorized from my account.
I don't approve of the tweetti, and I've deleted it. The later publication said it.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Even though the Tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first twit included a pictorial picture of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, sentenced to a rat drink in April 2013.
Perry missed the financing of Lehmberg when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is the potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of Tweet was: “I don’t always drive drunk, with three times more proms allowed... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for showing on the finger...
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
The Lehmberg Agency did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor at San Antiion, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he was innocent and called charges for political running.
His powerful judicial team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on the charge of the governor who was most convicted of Texas is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of state aid to a state service responsible for public injurement, which operates in the province of Travis and prosecutes the public sector when Lehmberg refused to resign.
The decision of Perry was taken by the follow-up group on the left to make an official complaint.
The Twitter account confirmed by Perry is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
Having reached the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting in 2012 during his presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie-up by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter flying on the lake, coming from South Carolina.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's most important developers has warned us that the housing market in South-East England has returned to a normal level of activity.
The capital of London's dwellings have been under huge demand and sharp price increases while there is fear of widespread expansion of credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder of a high-level contractor and President of Berkeley, said that: \"From the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the volume of shops have returned to normals after the 2013 peak, and added that this has enabled \"a stable operating environment\".
During a very recession in the London housing market, foreign investors made their way to the capital.
According to the land register data, prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about one fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the increased number of pounds has made London's buildings a less attractive object in recent months - some of the interest has also been affected by new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric from a possible \"cartano tax\" before the May general elections.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending orders, would lead to lower market growth, both in terms of sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
The recent information from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of loans accepted fell in July, which refers to the cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated the prices of London's real estate in 2015. According to this, prices fall by three per cent because the index measuring the prices of housing owners has already started to decline.
The number of successful shops in London in the most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfairi and Kensington have dropped in the fourth year ago, the real estate dealer WA Ellis tells us.
However, domestic demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which raised the income from the property sold to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Mr Pidgley added that the demand for ‘good’ product in the best places has remained stable and therefore sales have remained alert.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost one third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profits before taxes rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus falling to GBP 380 million and the turnover increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley reported that Berkeley's annual earnings correspond to the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profits before tax for the whole year amount to GBP 450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock was sold on the London Stock Exchange at a constant price of 23,96 pounds.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos into the network
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards event.
The hacker who claims he's holding hundreds of other stars pictures leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's nail photos online.
The representative of the famine star confirmed that the pictures were genuine and condemned the hacker’s ‘silver’ to breach privacy.
The authorities have been contacted and all who publish Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged with charges.
The pictures that were originally published on 4chan's photo release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands because of the weakness of the Apple iCloud storage system. For the other causes of hacking, ten other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed, were said.
It is not known how much of the images are real, but Scott Pilgrim against World Star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“For those who look at me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mind, Winstead twiittat.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon-iCarly-iCarly- and-Victorious-series denied the authenticity of the images and said, \"I see the so-called naked images of me as they were, don't you understand?
Let me finish this right away.
BuzzFeden announced late on Sunday that a pop star, a representative of Ariana Grande, denied the authenticity of the images concerning the stars.
The only new novel we have is Howard Jacobson, who has received thanks for his new novel, which tells us about love and the letter \"J\"
They slipped, it was the best thing to do, and they gradually got rid of each other like a box of cardboard left out of the rain.
Only then did he hear from the woman that she was too serious, impatient, intense, disengaged, and perhaps also a little tiny.
That's when he dropped his hand.
He recognized every single one of them.
Yeah, he was a little bit of a syllable.
His last victim had been in the early stages of a relationship which had, however, been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have made it easier for him to be alone, and it might have brought his life up to some content.
The Solomons of Ailin had unspoiled hair, and he was a delicate beautor with a cheerful heart, from the village of the north, which was even harsher and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel partner, which Kevern assumed to be his aunt. He had inherited a house that was in a wet but in a paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriate to the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the ethanols had left their tracks in the windows, keeping the whole place in their own garden, growing rich grasses, which resembled giant weights.
The cabin was like the rain of children, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
The author said: Howard Jacobson, the novel J, is conditional on the Booker's literature award in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern was sitting in his hand with Ailin in a broken steel chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both listening to a scattered reception through which the whole country had heard calm music and calming news, when the sun’s brown legs brought Kevern’s mind a song that had been singing a long time ago, a black performer, and which his father had often listened to in the cabin’s moorings at the bottom.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were originally too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were no longer called.
They wanted to leave it to their unhappiness, just like the word you've never said.
The general opinion led to what had not been achieved by laws and by the declaration: just as in the column of literature people chose to read heroes' memories, cook books and romances, for music they favour whales.
Kevern, as he blinked at the day, started an imaginary piano and sang a ceremony for the great nobles of Ailin, with a sound of impeccable collection.
Ailin didn't understand.
“It was a jazzpianist, Fats Waller’s famous song, ” Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was how his father had always done before the book had to run away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father while he was little.
His father told me he was playing the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start with your mouth, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for the pen.
It wasn't much fun playing at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailin's never heard of that.
It wasn't exactly a ban on jazz, it wasn't just a call.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's been the same way.
Its unforeseeableness made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness that was presented through music.
Even though Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by 10 years old, jazz music had become familiar with him through his father's half-circumstance CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Alilin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
The famous society meant that each of its parts was accepted with gratitude, as grateful, for being spared by the trade of happiness, the principle that each group had made natural things for it.
Based on their temperament and physical qualities, people with African relatives are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and run.
Originally from India’s continent, they were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that every family had a functional telephone used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the plate.
When SE, while JOS TAPAHTUI, was true, they were from the Gulf of Persia and from the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled viggly in the fear of being accused of the flames, and fearing that the flames would follow them, they opened restaurants that served the Labneh River and burned the water pipe, and continued their eyes on the ground as they were created and stunned.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailin had only heard Ballades, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern just sang had never been dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
They're not really offensive, Kevern said.
Except for the bigfoots, maybe.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
None of the words would pass through the sound separation of the giant calorie leaves.
However, Ali didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers for his lips with Ailin.
I thought he was weird right now.
\"It was funny,\" he said.
Ailin threw his head off as unbelievably, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing else to see in the whole world than the huge shadow of Alinn.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“If you say so, ” he said, “but it didn’t sound convincing.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, \"I love you, but it was still too early for it.
You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles, and he tried to fix the situation.
Well, I'm all twisted up in that sense.
This wasn't gonna help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to make fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, was missing the convincing charm that could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted the same thing.
Despite his favorite eyes.
Alin’s Solomons bled and rose from his steel chair and poured out the receiver and choked the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine had been made from the back of his back, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm tree leaves in a storm.
\"And your thick head is what I've been cursedly appealed to in you,\" he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alinn, for his own unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailin think he hit him?
He had never told Kevern of his life in a huddled north of the archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that it had been the same as life here.
It's the same huge, gloomy sea that started against them.
The same confused men, although after TAPAHTUNE, were even more paleer and plating than their secret drivers' parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who dared to resist or torture them.
Fat head?
He'd see a thick fist if he weren't careful!
First of all, pray for the word that the kiss had become the most common word of man and woman's erotic encounter; the host out of the unmarked love ballads of the pyremours – first and then take the attack.
Kevern also thought that was too much, because it was already hostile in itself.
The body language of Ailin Solomons told him to leave.
He pulled himself up from a steel chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him, just as his travel partner looked at Kevern's going from the window upstairs, a man who himself was responsible for his heavy life.
Adam's leaving the garden, he's thinking.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
A man who had turned his mind, a cosmos, a disgraced, a man who had lost all the fighting skills – why did he feel so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and zealous 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the General mind in Ofnow, did a brief study of the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the countries where violence was reduced, or even ending, was likely to take into account the money and energy used to torture it.
“A lot has already come to pass, and much has not yet been done, he wrote: “For thousands of years, and most of the winning people, the natural aggression, especially in the abandoned and peripheral hills, where, despite the coffins that are beyond the peacocks, human nature is rarely known at the time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the moods it gives us.
The nation is crying about the perseverance of the persuasional Ballads, embling the anointed stories and swearing to the virtues of marriage and family life, but, at the same time, old cruelty is indiscriminate in taking both rural communities and urban communities, and there is also evidence of a new, sexier argument in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
“You have to regret the tendency to dramatize, ” said his director after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
“I don’t have to answer that, ” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to his court not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again the silence.
“I don’t ask, ” Luther Rabinowitz said, “I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There are no prejudices to this job.
We are servants of unpredicted society.
Although a certain kind of hypersensitivity is entirely acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church – and what you call cruel or evil - souled, others generally call being natural energy and physical strength.
As if it happened yesterday, if it happened, it will destroy the fundamental vital vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while he was talking about Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the Flamingonvaan red LED light declared the direction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country by the fourth or longer of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the pools, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, don't agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and singing the word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
“I understand very well what you want to say, ” Esme Nussbaum replied with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had finished, “and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will see that we are repeating the same mistakes that initially led to SIIHEN, whose TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI.
This time, though, we do not shed our hatred and confidence in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “as you described as error” the actions that our grandparents may have done or not to do.
You will also go too far when you say that they poured out their 'feel' and their distrust to others.
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or to defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'others'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
“If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos, Esme was afraid to continue, “No group of society can say that he has behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What they did was good or bad.
That's when it was then.
There is no need to talk more about it – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to give up charges, there is no need to make adjustments, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But for what purpose the past exists if it is not learned...
There's a past so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
\"I'm going through your report,\" he said, and he said, \"It was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he came to work, he was hit by a motorbike driving on a footway, described by the passers as “sacrifice and rageful. ”
It happens.
Lesotho's army is denying its plans to strike; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have told us that they framed a strike for the fall of the government and said that they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and occupied government buildings in the capital in Maserus.
The Prime Minister and his family went to the neighbouring country after they told him that there was a threat of death.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a military representative, said that the military responded to the threat that came from \"political fanatics\". The police have said that they have tried to arm fanatics.
“Lesotho’s defence forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence data that some police forces were trying to force young party fanatics when they were prepared to cause their problems, ” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to the President of the South African Government, Clayson Monyla, military action seemed like a revolution attempt.
“Even though no authority has claimed that the government has been abolished by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be in all respects the signs of a revolutionary company, ” he says.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their cages on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government when Thabane is away.
Thabane says he believes he's the target of action because he's been trying to fight corruption.
Lesotho has had tensions since June when Thabane suspended Parliament's sessions because of the differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the government's power, even though it is otherwise claimed.
Store magazine: Microsoft sets up a data center for Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center for the Uusimaa, whose location the company refuses to specify.
In a press release sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in Microsoft.
In public, the centre had previously been cut to Oulu or Kajania.
Microsoft completely ceases to work at Oulu, which takes about 500 people to work.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that he will resign from up to 1 050 jobs in Finland.
The Microsoft Communication Director, Camilla Lindfors, tells STT that the company does not comment on how much new data center employs staff.
The establishment of the Data Centre to Uusimaa told the newspaper on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have a variety of options to choose from.
The most successful option is a waterproof compact point-and-shot camera such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these photos at the family party myself using several different cameras each cost less than $350.
There are some rules that should be followed, regardless of the device.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed watertightly.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
In some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera, there is a Regulation that makes it possible to optimise the description conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure you can take your device deep.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Meet both our regular and water-proof models in our shopping guide and in the reviews of digital cameras.
Take a number of pictures – many of them fail in some way.
The complex cameras have a LCD display that allows you to sum up the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see under the water, and the harmony of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera allows for additional scratching, which means taking multiple images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced by deeper depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface while describing the pool, the lake or the sea.
This will give you more colors for your images; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the object you're describing.
This is important advice when describing the country, but even more important under water, because the light conditions are weak.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide image angle, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire image of the frames while working.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for elections in 2017, despite the lack of peace required for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to cause a spark to Hong Kong business block for long-awaited protesters to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese Congress of Nations will in practice give the Communists the power to push away all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
\"This was expected, but it's still disgusting,\" says the Chairman of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with the independent regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidate for the Hong Kong leader's choice would be too far-off.
Since 1997, when the UK gave Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to closely control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee, which will be managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and love Hong Kong will be accepted.
During the summer before the decision, some of the major and most significant protests in the region took place in Hong Kong for years.
Behind the campaign for democracy there was largely Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to prevent business block operations if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong real public voting rights.
On Sunday night, only hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters met at a rain in front of Hong Kong headquarters.
In meditation, the traffic organisers announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil intolerance and would create protests in the coming weeks.
But they did not mention details, apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their communications published on the website, the organisers said that they would consider the Occupy Central concept as the last tool to be introduced only if there was no hope for dialogue and there was no other way to go.
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance of dialogue has been removed and that the centralisation will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing to report to Beijing for days, and on Sunday security measures were close to the main structures of the government, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, there are many feelings that the inhabitants are quietly losing their power in their city.
The wave from the mainland has produced competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its mental expressions threaten the life condition of Hong Kong – a business world.
“The protest they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” says legislator Regina Ip, who has long appreciated the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong to get away from us.
Such an image would be bad for investing.

This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the major demonstrations supporting democracy in the region.
U.S. Prom tradition hits British universities: new students' private jets
We are eager to meet the demand by establishing the first class of luxury travel in Britain for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the maximum possible arrival at the university.
Stewart says there's also a safety aspect of the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide students today with as easy and high-quality transport as possible.
According to the company's representative, no reservations have yet been made, as the service has only been set up, but added that students will start ordering during the next few weeks.
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9 000 pounds per academic year.
The students of today are very different from those of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, in terms of their expectations and expectations, and now it is more important than ever to create an eternal first impression, and the VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, a national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice-President of the University Department, Megan Dunn, this service plan seems to be very far from the student majority's life.
In this month, many of their studies start to shock the cost of living when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has remained after the sharp rise in basic living costs.

Koriball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to pass out on the field
Koriball Sasu Salin was today a body of Finnish victory.
He was able to forget the depth of his US match and explained the blood of the other half of Ukraine with their standing solutions.
But Salin moved all the credit to the Susifanes and did it in style:
I was going to pass out on that field at the end of the field, and that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, my sume, couldn't do anything.
It was almost too much for me. It was almost too much for me.
The power moments of Salin included nine surfaces in fast pace, balloons, plates and temmelin in every place that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got the kind of Flow space that everything worked out.
They come only once, and now it's an intelligent place, Susu's glowing.
It's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see the others get caught.
It was infected with the whole gang.
Salin is a team of joys and spirits, so it is no wonder that his example took the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after the 32th year break: I thought about the preludes of a serious referee game
Heikki Montonen (oik.) was the head coach of Finland at the Argentina MM tournament in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish Men's Balloon team played the last time in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember the tournament of one thing like yesterday: it was in the first round a hot match against France.
\"In this match, the referee game was dirty, remembers Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already put themselves on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it at 2-3 and then the shits went more than that, told Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montosen in command and eventually entered 17.
Now Finland will be among the world's lights once the Polish MM tournament is on its way this Saturday.
Many things have changed violently in the international aviation sphere over 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same category as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
The average lengths of players have also grown.
The game's even faster than it is, so think about Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland getting further from the primary section.
Well, then you can get a little tight.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenone, Joko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a public player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're being deceived into place 17.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down, said Parkkali.
Lajilegenda Reino Kosonen was a second country coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were blowing in the match in Tunisia.
The sauna and the evening at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the national team program at the MM tournament in 1982.
Kari Kalin (oik.) pulled with his teammates.
The finals of the young star game competition won't win South Karelia.
Veera Vento and Veeti Tikkanen did not go to the finals of the Young Star game competition.

The finalists will still record the songs of the competition.
There'll always be great memories of the moment of competition, Immonen says.
The Finnish courts saved the Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: “These men deserve all the credit.
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were on Thursdays in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered to help.
The weekend is Mikkelsen looking for “in-house heroes ” on Facebook to thank his assistants once more.
Mikkelsen told me in the public Facebook update that he and Cita dog on Thursday night in the mountains hurt his coat.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep ground.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried several times to attract and draw it a little forward, but its legs did not just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help from the police, a close hotel, or a passer.
At night's dark, the situation started to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two pedestrians who were willing to help: Antti Soini, the tamperite, and his father, Tumo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on the Galdhøpiggen and headed for their camp place when they saw the breasts of a woman and a dog in the middle of a mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells me in her message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man who had a cabin with him.
A few of the cases were taken from Patja to Cita, to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came here for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog out of his arms for a while, soini says.

The dog was taken down by means of a rat.
Soin said that the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slowly carried out in a difficult land.
After about a half an hour, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for international heroes on Facebook to thank them once more.
The phone calls answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still out of reach.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I don't think I thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, and I am eternally grateful to them.
Last night against Monday, the Sorns were already on their way home.
They'd been happy to hear from Mikkelsen:

Genetic abnormalities are often diagnosed wrongly
The British woman was afraid for years to die because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left because he had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves of the brain and the spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK authorisation organization, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as there is so little known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in Great Britain suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motor diseases, such as muscle weakness, difficult walks and sores.
The disease may also cause loss of consciousness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms are worsening over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was getting ill with Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he'd be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and he would die before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, the mother of a 51-year-old two children says that, as a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same thing as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several midget surgery to perform his legs. In the event of surgery, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, after I checked the medical records in the library, and I wrote to the FA association, he says.
When I got their information, I was shocked and in a panic condition.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I was 25, and in the meantime I'd lose my whole ability to act quietly.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by 17 years of age he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just wanted me and said, \"Yo, baby, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in the wheelchair.
I think you're suffering considerably less from a dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
When I was explained what a CMT disease was, I thought I'd been delayed, he'd tell me.
Charity CMT UK order for the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The purpose of the experiment was to examine the reproductive capacity and use of the genes in an inert state.
One male and four females participated in the test.
Although the test sounds extraordinary, its purpose was serious.
The effects of inefficiencies, for example, on the development of gene eggs, are known only to be limited.
Through the effects of Geksuka, efforts can be made to predict the weightlessness of the effects on humans in the corresponding state of time in this state, as illustrated by the New Statesman in July.
Roscosmus says that the time of death and cause or cause of death of the genes will be investigated.

France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport.
France arrested the suspect at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have acted as a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the matter on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track a man after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline didn't believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but was alarmed by the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely ignorant of the daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Czech Republic, but he lives in France today.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s action before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people attracted by the wars in Iraq or Syria constitute a security risk for France as well.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French or French citizens have traveled to Syria, returned from or are currently planning their departure to Syria during the last conflict.
Koronen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team are in play as Finland meets today in its second match of MMs with Ukraine.
If the opening phase for the United States was expected, Ukraine will be part of the countries where Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petter Kopene's premier.
In his first match on Saturday, Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is coaching NBA veteran Mike Fratello, whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Eugene-Pooh-Jeter, whose sister Carmenita Jeter is a world champion of 100 metres behind three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter, quick guy, but yes, we're being played against such things before, and we need to get our standard defense fixed, Kopenen said.
Hanno Mötöllä promised that Finland will play better than in its last defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you that the field will see a normal box of wolves, Mötösä said.
The alleged attacks of Hollywood stars are spreading online... part of the confirmed fences.
A number of naked images on the Internet are claimed to be presenting well-known persons of publicity.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of a risk-taking campaign.
The website of TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of images.
This is a dirty violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted and any who publishes stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be placed in charge of prosecution, and representatives will be threatened.
According to the TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the pictures spreading him are real.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
As far as I know that those pictures were destroyed long ago, I can only imagine what a creepy pain was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who became victims of the hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice calls pictures of his own name faked.
At least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krüsten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer are on the move.
The Honka painter criticises his own: \"They don't work hard enough to get out of here.
The football Seura FC Honka is currently in the last place in Veikkausligi.
After the Sunday VPS match, Maralivahti Walter Viikala's comments are a very confused current situation.
I haven't had a goal coach for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted.
In the first half of the fight, the honka made many mistakes in defense.
The painter, Vitala, was not a bad fight for defense in his mind.
The gamer traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and for this reason the defenders in the presence of Viekaan have changed their course.
In addition, many young players have received opportunities that they may not even deserve.
\"It doesn't work enough to get out of here sometimes,\" \"The Five did not call any single player.
Honga’s chief coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Vieka.
After the game, I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun, and you think you're a knife player, and you don't have to work, you must be in the wrong team, Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the possibility, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players cannot expect immediate success when gamemates constantly change.
This season has not doubled the same composition.
Especially in defense, people have changed.
It's the biggest reason why we're here, Kuqi said.
The Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS phase, at the level of the second last TPS.
There are seven more cycles left, so there is still time for espoolans to avoid falling into the Ykkö.
I've never done a team before, and I'm not gonna do it now.
We're definitely not going to fall off this show.

The ice water is poured on 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts moment before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be attached to the first aid.
A 20-year-old British student who participated in a super-sounding challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The video holder has become an Internet installation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of the wolves to the extremation (also): How can you explain the growth of the fan?
It was a great file today.
Thus said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played the EM final tournament against France at Athens Marouss Balloon.
He didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were those of about 100 Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers, otherwise I ruled out noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are hundreds of Finnish fans eighty times.
The EM-play 1995 was the time to search for Finnish basketball.
The men cut their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian race at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory would open the doors to the European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Mötös.
Henrik Dettmann, head coach, put Möttösö in the final tournament team.
The solution that many disagreed with.
Now, you can say that Dettmann was far-fetched, even though not all went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team went deep.
In Athens competitions, Finns were well-knownly over 100.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coachers and some fans.
In Bilbao, there are journalists, relatives and trainers, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to the immeasurable dimensions.
I'm sure no one can say an exact number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
It was a figure of any number there, it's just an inexplicable number.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologs.
In a global economy, companies move across borders.
Sport still has the opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As we increase mobility, we can see how our girls and our boys are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu Ikonen of Level Biology.
Certainly, both in Spain and in the World Cup World Cup in Poland there are Finns who apply for their lives.
Joint experience.
It still doesn't explain everything.
You know, there's got to be a lot of pressure in sports, too.
It's time to raise sports as part of the popularian culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to sports games than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, however, masses are not allowed to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to go to top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then it moved, and the land team activities got up on the ground.
The balloons did the same thing a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruit of work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The audience is also interested in that.
And the media has taught us what such Carnereal Support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball species also move this massive interest into the home saris?
On average, basketball is played for hundreds or a little more than a thousand viewers.
The point is that the question is good, and it may not be possible to give an answer that would promise very good species.
The second school believes the interest is moving.
The other one is the one who doesn't want to sweeten the stomach full.
This group is ready for a trip to the World Cup, but in their basic ideas, domestic series are not of two interest.
There's a challenge for the followers in the middle of the drug.
Security for Bottxan's property - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola will reward the formula driver on the beach in Valtter Botttaks.
At its meeting on Monday, the municipality unanimously approved a property of 1.4 hectares.
Tont will have a free time dwelling in the future.
The success of Bottx has been monitored in Nastola since this time of mapping.
He's being treated as a good ambassador to market Late, Lahti's uncle and Nestola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärjärve.
It has become part of a larger real estate store owned by the municipality of Nastola.
There are seven buildings in the area, from which the municipality will land at the expense of six out by the end of this year.
Bottos achieved his fourth prize winner this year at the Belgian competition in Form One.
He's at MM points five.
Bottas is a native Nazi and lived with Vil source of his childhood.
He lives right now in England, but he's always in Nastola when he's free from formulas.
Bottos has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design intelligence is coming, but it's hardly for the poor.
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's intelligence testers are field ballmen, but also amateur Marcus Giron, one of the tops of the college players, likes.
According to him, the shirt helps him to monitor his own development and to regulate his recovery.
There are silver sensors in the nylon shirt, where information is conveyed to the nuts in the shirt, and from there is still a smartphone or a flat-screen computer.
Anturis measure the heart rate, the rhythm of breathing, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the central unit will be removed.
The fashion house has not told us exactly the time to start selling the shirt, nor did it even tell you about the price, the Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothes.
The California Athos has brought out the smart and smart shorts.
They measure the heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The demands cost a hundred dollars apiece and the size of the thumb they require will be the center unit costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about technical clothes.
A smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of college books in America is over $1,000 for many students, so the Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, soon came up with a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which students of later annual courses lend their books against nominal compensation instead of selling the books forward at the same time.
“My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for it throughout the academic period, and I was snooping a sandwich, ” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his book during the last academic period would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent 120 dollars on them.
According to the University's Board of Directors, the average student spends over $1 200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means to reduce these costs.
Students are becoming increasingly involved in using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent books so that they can use the book throughout the academic period and pay for it clearly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company holding more than 250 campus bookstores, the renting of books has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the sector reveal that about one quarter of the books from the books of universities were rent books in the spring, says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus bookstores.
Here's the simplest way to save clear money.
Online goods
In online shopping, only one third of the price it would pay for in the bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's 9th edition is almost $290, but the book from the online store of special books Chegg.com is priced at $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and lost appearances.
For example, the \"Calculus\" book is available for use in Chegg.com online store at USD 93.49.
Brigham Young University's final year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says that he bought a book “Strategic Media Details: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business – used for Amazon.com only $0.42.
A new book would have cost 48 dollars.
Ingrid Bracey and other academies recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous weights at the course.
At times, reforms in new editions are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to purchase used books.
Renting
You should consider renting books if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you do not need them when you complete the course.
By renting over 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a \"Calculus book\" for the entire academic period costs about $20.
Take note of the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use and wear of the highlight threshold for the following payments.
The renter, please be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-mails
Acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented when the right to use an e-book is paid to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg will receive the “Calculus book e-book for six months by about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, many literature students save most because several classics today can be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing different sellers, whichever option they choose.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon begin with Pepperdine in law science, recommends that the ISBN number be used to determine the price, as it will enable you to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order a net, make sure the book is stored, Gaul says.
He himself learned this through the back of his head.
The delivery of the book he bought was in the ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full cost from the university bookstore.

He believes that every human can change his own life.
The fires almost double the number of people killed compared to last year.
This year, almost double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Centre (Sppe) the fires have so far killed 55 people in 49 different fires.
Last year, at the same time, fire mortality was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
More than 65 years of age have been 11.
According to the organization's fire mortality statistics, the worst situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the burns occur in apartments.
There are 17 fire deaths in the accounts, 21 in their own homes, and seven in row houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the repetition of home fire safety.
At least the performance of all fire detectors in the home should be ensured according to Speck.
In addition, everyone should be able to check that the initial destruction equipment is easily accessible.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protest at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of them gathered in the city centre of Newport on the march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall at the so-called \"residence\" meeting.

Young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
KAKSI, a teenager, was brought to safety after the night in a trap in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went walking after noon on Sunday to Govetts League in Blackheath.
They were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police from the middle of the night.
A search team composed of local police officers and assistants was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found at approximately 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were brought up on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers retreated from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been very keen to join the Russian tanks on the field.
According to the army's representative, the opposite cannon fire has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professionals.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
The Ukrainian patrol ship, which was awarded yesterday at the South-Eastern Ukraine, was sinking in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been saved and two are still missing.
The border guard had no certainty about where the ship was shot.
The Separatists already told me yesterday that they shot the ship in social media.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, Russia is not going to attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops immediately withdraw to positions that they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should lead to an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also recalled that Russia should respond to possible new economic patents.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our companies.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains brought Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets were flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when the rainfalls struck South Sweden and Denmark.
The flood water cut off a number of roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that the flood may last, even though the rains were predicted to cease to be Monday.
The hard rains led to surprise by the Swedish authorities, and there was no prior weather warning for rains.
The emergency meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Aviation Institute estimates that the sadderinta, which has been in need of the area, was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow, and it's still standing.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French Socialists should be quiet and help France, says Francois Hollande's main aids
Valls strongly called on the divided left-wing to show his feelings: the socialist president in difficulty, who did not receive the approval of the French majority in the composition of the new government.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our mission is to stay with him, ” said Valls, and he deserved the applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace, despite the 35-hour working week of the French dispute, the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron, who had previously given the debate this week, on the proposal that the rule should be deliberate.
On Saturday, Hollande asked socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Mr Taubira, Minister of Justice, expressed his interest in the meeting of socialists who had expressed differing opinions and criticised the Socialist Party for allowing it to give up hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Supreme National Front, mocked the continued esteem of the Socialists and said that the new government of Valls would not believe for a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
“And the new government will not last until autumn or winter, ” said Le Pen to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to break up the Parliament and made sure his party's election profit in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French governing party suffered a crush in March municipal areas and the extremism held a list of cuts in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion poll of the Journal du Dimanche, 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up to several competing groups before the end of the Dutch era in 2017.
The political scientist at Po-University Pascal Perrineau warned that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government is able to improve the economy and record unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to notice quickly that the change is happening, ” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
In the morning, Pukka Pouda's young boy, Kirsi Alm-Siran, Nina Rahkola, and meteorologist Pukka Pouda, betrayed the program in a taped section.
Last Thursday, the Finnish programme published a fun video on Thursday.
The video is used by runners Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahküla and the meteorologist Pega Pouta are trying to record the post of Finland's advertising buffer the next day, but the recording is not going to go quite well.
Alm-Sir is confused with what he says when he tries to say the word budget line, and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their cheeks once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to carry out a live broadcast tomorrow, and the Finnish Facebook update says morning.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has both been liked and distributed more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked at the newspaper’s photo office, placed in the third potter series in 1972.
The image contains Mr Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel.
At the House of Building Masters in Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International Assembly was held in May 1971.
There were a lot of Heads of State at the meeting and there were huge security measures.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received a great deal of five minutes of filming.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and background were right.
I just realized I did it this time.
It seems to me that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was in the form of known persons or images taken from events.
It is great that other images can succeed today, as long as there are ideas and visual rules.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall picture of the Munich Olympics in Lasse Virén.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Opposition: Over EUR 5 million already paid by the Aarnio investigation
The examination of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki police drug service has already cost more than EUR 5 million and requested 30-50 years of employment.
In this way, JYRI Rajamäki will evaluate thesis on information technology to the University of Jyväskyla.
The border states that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could, at all, be significantly improved by combining research and judicial IT systems.
As far as the border is concerned, current technology enables multiple use of criminal technical material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the data collected for the investigation of the crime is automatically filled with electronic evidence that fills the evidence chain and, at the same time, enables comprehensive legal supervision.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Top: The concept of vegetable food in 1999 was forgotten on the wall of the school: “Food and chicken dishes in Kasvisdiet
The picture of the special information on the wall of the Pyrikkaan Women's Travel School caused food in social media, reports Yle's website.
Cranberries!
Fish and chicken dishes included in the school lunch season.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a herbal alternative!
This is the case for a school wall forgotten, 15 years old in a press release.
You'll be able to see the picture from here.
The image in the social media has led people to send a hearty feedback to Pirkkaa.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, notes Yle that the box that was forgotten on the wall is not correct and should have been removed from time ago.
Apparently, before I come, it has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed in due time with healthcare.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, a herbal food option is offered only with the permission of parents and with a certificate from the doctor or nurse.
The scratch is based on a solution to Yle because young people's herbal experiments may leave food behind and the absence of meat or chicken may cause a miracle for the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near a $3 billion Prestige Cruise agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates with three billion dollars of its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc.

According to sources, information on the possible agreement may be published this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises company, the private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names in public because negotiations were not held in public.

Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The cruise industry worth USD 29 billion is expected to benefit from the rise in the economies that are developing in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies compete to become the first option for these new customers when choosing cruises.
Pressige Cruises register its first share in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares after 2007, worth USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in 2000 with its current composition, combined with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a cruise company. The latter is a Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting’s share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo’s 20 per cent and its share of the private capital investment company TPG Capital LP was 8 per cent from the end of June.

The City Government of Tampere is discussing this issue today.
Animalia wishes the city government to continue supporting the initiative.
According to Salla, the director of Animalia, who is preparing thesis for Tampere University, according to Salla Vainvara, for dolphins in Finland and around the world, it is necessary to end rapidly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, it has become widespread that the use of dolphins such as dolphins in dolphins is not animal conservation or ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to take place in Tampere.
The end of the Delphinary is not only a question of animal law, but also of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, the Court notes.
According to the risk of the sentence, the death of Näsi-delphine confirms the requirements of the lower line of dolphin activity.
I saw death as a sad thing to go on in the dark history of the Särkanjenem's dolphin.
It is time for the deaths to be placed at a point, shut down the dolphins' prison and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a restricted sea area, to a sort of dolphin shelter, the risk of the crime requires.
It was not possible to experience the return of dolphins to the original living environment, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkännem were able to experience more life than their unsuspected concrete, hopeful health.
The aim of the Animal Protection Union Animal Protection Union is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection law under preparation.
The dolphins are also included in this group.
In support of this demand, the Executive Director of Animalia will be involved in today's 1.9th demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
Japan's Embassy in Helsinki is being held against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, some 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or brutally killed annually, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls for Kiova to open negotiations with East Ukraine on the new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian Government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the regional state of origin, reports Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukrainian region of Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
The demand for negotiations with Russian rebel rebels, put forward by Putin to the Government of Kiev, corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to assist separatists to take over the region and thus to force the Ukrainian government in practice to grant the newly-declared Novorossian independence, which enables it to focus on Russia instead of West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to reinstate the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region ruled by the Separatists, whose separatists took over on 18 March when Moscow joined the Ukrainian Crimea.
The Kreml and Separatists have recently baptized the region as the Novorossian, the new Russia - this term reminds us of the great days ahead of the revolutions of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks were a win-win, as long as Ukrainian politicians take campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist controlled areas.
“We need to start immediately extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-Western Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of the people living there,” he says.
According to Peskovi, Putin's reference to \"statement\" is linked to a broader independence which has been discussed with the Kiova management for months in trying to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant Eastern Territories the independence they need, says Peskov.
There is no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, \"because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine -
The mid-term communication of the representative of the Kreml, which was intended to correct the misinterpretation of Putin’s comments, stressed that the Russian regime treats the rebellion of separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in Crimea, in practice, taking over a region whose majority of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect even the areas of Donetsk or Luhansk in East Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to the pre-conflict surveys, the majority of the population were in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree themselves on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kreml practically within the territory of the power which connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was linked to Russia five months ago, is located in the main Russian fleet and in the ports of commercial shipping and historical coastal destinations.
The region between Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal sinks that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukraine's legislators consider constitutional changes to increase the powers of the regions that depart from the Ukrainian core area from their own economy and the status of languages.
His vision of independence, however, seems to differ strongly from the view of the separatists of arms and flames, perhaps Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his last demand to the Government of Kiev on negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels moved further last week after Russian tanks and troops entered East Ukraine from a peaceful area on the coast of the Sea of Azov.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the town of Novoazovsk separatists supported by Russia is the beginning of a greater effort aimed at taking over the entire strategic coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military staff to establish the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, a citizen of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to the peninsula of Crimea.
On Saturday, in Brussels, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon arrive at a point that has not returned, ” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders presented additional sanctions to implement if the crisis in Ukraine is re-imposed in unclear circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the region of Ilovakis after the transfer of two Russian armored departments and 1 000 soldiers last week to the Donetsk region in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 soldiers of Ukraine, from the island of Ilovakis, were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers, who were imprisoned in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was to make Japanese teacher Kesuke Handa on the seventh game pattern.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar first hit and a little later came from Jeremy Menez's penalty kick.

Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko at the vortex
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been stunned by hackers to steal his fiancée and the Hollywood A-list Gabi Grecko's naked photos.
In the entertainment world, you've been shattered since a bunch of Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging film hacking scandal.
Hakker has been told that he has a total of 60 naked images of Näläpel star Lawrence and other superstars such as Kate Upton and Cara Deleving, singer Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also, the images of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko, Melbourne, have apparently been stolen in connection with iCloud.
The list has 101 famous names.
Edelsten, who said that last month, said to the Confidential magazine, this is disgusting.
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
The Greckon, New York, and his comments, are reported on the case on the web page, saying that the victims feel embarrassed.
The hacker believes that there are 30 photos of Palmer with this last boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples from Palmer on top of the upper surface.
Palmer's film events include Love and Honor, the opponent, Liam Hemsworth.
