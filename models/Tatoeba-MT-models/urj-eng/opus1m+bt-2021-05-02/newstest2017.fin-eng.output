The 28-year-old kitchen champion was found dead at the mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old kitchen champion who moved to San Francisco was found dead at the door of the local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, saying: “It finally went well.
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, and the San Francisco death investigator's office was called.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a mental crime and that the investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a bus driver in Boston, had received his dream job place as the Sanfranciscolais Sons & Daughters restaurant coordinator six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Deughters said that they're very upset and shocked, because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close family, and he’s going to be very much missed, ” the representative said.
We will send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostel, but that recently, his business was finally going well.
He found the apartment and dated a girl, Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said she didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her younger brother.
He was a benevolent, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to make us food, to make dinner, Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was the brother who drove along with the river.
“In the world where so many things are wrong, he was an unspoken diamond who shined every day brighter, ” he said.
Everyone with information is invited to call the San Francisco Police Department's tipline number 415-575-444.
Doctors to strike: Requirements for new work combat measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new work combat measures in their dispute on a new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the entire Council to support new work efforts from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
Doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the elected members rejected it.
On Thursday night, in a letter published by Twitter, Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the JDC, said that the government had remained silent - one-stop - questions that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: \"In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a specific meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for a gradual and expanding work programme beginning in September.
It has been observed that medical practitioners have participated in six stops this year, including the first complete recruitment in the history of the NHS health care system.
The President of the BMA medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected, the conditions recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before 54 000 doctors and students voted that the agreement was good and that it should be approved.
After the vote, Minister for Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, who ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to hand each other and to declare the battle of eight months of words and economic sanctions officially closed.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I got a clear impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
Yes, the event was held.
But Putin's smile looked violent, and he didn't exactly threaten the heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
However, Recep Tayyyip Erdogan kept talking about his “serious friend, Putin, ” five times according to one report.
I've lost my mind in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal was a picture of the opposite.
But Putin-silvers showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow's reaction was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabting Moscow in his back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a certain friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media governed by the state led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turkish were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories ruled by Isis.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all of his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failed coup of last month.
Continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic patents have been heavy, especially the ban on order flights, which usually carry millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has dropped by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and order airlines will certainly be relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season's attack on the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
You've come back here, tomatoes, like the Vedemast newspaper report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry with the West of what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted coup.
When it is added to its long-lasting regret of the advanced EU membership negotiations, Putin, which is eager to use coolness and to undermine Turkish ties to the Western countries.
The Russian leader has certainly received exit points from Ankara, where he called after a revolution company to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, who has its own deep - rooted fear of change of power.
So this meeting in the French Coastal Court allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce the \"outermost alliance\" as one analyst described the situation for me: two countries that experienced the abandonment and abuse of Western countries, bringing together their forces.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed itself on the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a great deal of noise that, after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster, NATO member of Turkey shooting down Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be cut to back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international objectives.
After almost eight years ago, the bank had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have now used the “RBS” brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used for international sports sponsorship, from Six Nations-rugby Wimbledon master Andy Murrayy.
But it is now the right thing to let the national brands come to the front.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it is not re-launched from the start.
In England and Wales, all RSS references except the main office and stock exchanges are converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwani was interviewed on a round of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become our investor brand and our employees’ employer, because we are now going to be a lot more brand bank –
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
The RBS has already said that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship, and it has raised the profile of the brands in its sports sponsorship.
\"We now have the time to move in the direction of the brand bank, because essentially (we have been asking) is how we can concentrate on doing this to customers a better bank,\" said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynic if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done as a focus on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3000 won
Dettori showers champagne after double win after he has a total of 3000 wins
The contestant Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He arrived at his second victory on his homepath in a competition with John Gosden by coaching Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who won earlier at Ghayyar, said: “This is special.
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks on his own when he pulls Predilection out after victory.
Two contestants have reached this refreshing obstacle contest - master jockey Richard Johnson and lived 20-fold Master Sir Anthony McCoy, who had record of over 4300 winnings on his career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers in the current era, and it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, which only few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical bitch separates him from other weighing rooms.
He's a great ambassador to the competitions, his passion and charisma have drawn fans to the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rided 6000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for British competition, but he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates a fresh-floor brand landing from the pit.
From flying stops to plane landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain track.
Shares of profits in big competitions, including his famous \"Magnificent Seven\" victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft accident and suffered a competition ban because of drugs.
Three years ago, he began to find it difficult to return to his six months after the ban on competition, but he showed a significant characterity in challenging suspects and returning to the best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, and Dettori has said before that he would like to continue his competition until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin separates the head of staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
63 years old is now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin opinion said that Putin had ordered Ivanov to move away from the leadership of the Russian presidential regime, but there was no reason for this.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Parado, 44, is the former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, says Kreml's website (venjek).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the Head of State, as well as the drafting of laws and the management of your guidance.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that Nato be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, was the Soviet Security Service in KGB.
As head of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a public television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the head of staff withdrew from their own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just some kind of power struggle after?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official statement that a man once declared a potential candidate for president wants to suddenly lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real doubt.
In his comments on the Kreml website, Putin Ivanov said: “It is true that early in 2012, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex task, if you could even say the job, the task.
Well, now I've been head of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of state security service at FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed vice president.
When Putin took over, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was considered that Ivanov could come from Russia after the second season of President Put, because Putin's third season would have been against the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another one of Putin’s close ally, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to President only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson got a shoe after he hit a producer.
Gibson was involved last month in a physical dispute at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced that they had resigned in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner presented an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened, he said in his statement.
According to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is to be removed from the FBI team's team will be expected later.
Previously on Dharma & Greg's 54-year-old experience has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last 12 years, ” said Gibson in the opinion published on Friday.
I had hoped to be with you all the way to the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible working group, and above all the best fans on the show.
The start of the 12th production period in Series has been planned on 28 September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banffi
The man in Banffi has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be winds that have left the water vortex behind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters away from the sea, published in Periscope film material, hoping that someone would be able to provide clarity for the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fifeen
1,35 billion pounds are now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry’s crossing point, as well as the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It's the first of the four feathers between the cans, which are now preparing for each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 hair ropes.
1,35 billion pounds are now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the working country today and was walking from the first to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing point.
We are all witnessing the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which uses over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone for the construction of this bridge section.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where the extreme dimensions should be agreed.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the final part of the deck is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire cover is ready to be lifted to place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this seal represents the tip of building technology.
After the final share of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road map, we had to then close the remaining part on the north side, i.e. on the inland side.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south from the north way.
This was a huge and at the same time a very demanding measure.
It's huge because the ground is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes, and it was supposed to be drawn at about 3% of the angle.
It is necessary, because the allowed deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimetres in both directions.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are very happy when they're alive.
Three men are very happy when they're alive, after they fell off their fishing boat in front of England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop on the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim into their safety while their boat was moving on to themselves.
\"We saw a boat going closer to the men, and we imagined the worst, \"Mielfre's lifeboat Swedes Vince Jones said.
“There was a strong wind that blew it away from them by the time we got on the move, ” he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found hanging out of a pickup shop without a lifeboat.
The men were taken into the coastboat and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said: “These three men that have been put into the water are happy when they are alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a capped rope, but it had somehow broken off the boat from the time-time person when the boat fell.
Someone's taking care of these guys tonight.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting of health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The show time was originally set for television, then video games, and now recently for smartphone phones.
So it's great to see that technology and external activity are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I refer to the wildness called Pokemon Go. Application based on characters that were originally developed for video games in the 1990s (they were later born in the drawing series, game cards and other follow-up products).
As with many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the publication of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the publication of the game was postponed in other countries, as the huge popularity of overburdening servers.
Only in the days of Pokémon Gola had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
In the header shell, players use their smartphone to track Pokemons, which can be photographed after finding, or picturing a phone.
A family that played the game younger, has joined the wild and jumped up with the couch in search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of average blood flow.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the publication of the game, the number of people moving within 30 minutes of the day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokemon Gota, it only sees the training level.
A number of public health campaigns call for 30- to- and to be active every day, have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and conveyable by people who seem harmless.
However, the importance of sport cannot be reduced.
Regularly mobile people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
Pokémon Gon's fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine and fun.
Some people even get to hunt new friends.
As usual, the plights of joy seek the things that they complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications such as Fitzbit that could be monitored for activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new alarm disappears and the use of it will be dissolved in time.
However, because of Pokemon’s success there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles picked up gold in a women's gymnastics multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity test.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energic in the jump.
Sweaking booms.
I can't believe it.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multi-game on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to the light of the Olympics.
His overall point, 6.2.198, was clearly better than that of the shoppingist and the Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian prossimist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles in a balance party in the final round of women's multi-playing life in the Summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman, who has won the championship in a row, and, in all, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation as his generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He broke out in tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement will raise his same category with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has ruled his species for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, programmes whose mixture of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him \"best to see as a gymnastic\"...
The last test was in Brazil, a competition that was not so Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning to the family's home in Texas Spring would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and hopsatala (in this order) in the final of the women's teen-sucking multi-play in the summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, 2016.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as a top priority at the National Team Coordinator Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of the future as long as I knew the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes the extremism of his trademark, is equipped with Latin American music, which would also be excellent for the street next to the Olympics of Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taaperone, found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the hall where Boorman trained her, has become a forcemaker.
He has not lost a multi-game since the summer of 2013, and this winning tube would continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Blackfina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The weight boom and the permanence, where Biles is the world champion, were waiting.
He ascended to the top of his boom points at 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 permanone.
Raisman felt good when they waited for the final points - only the formalities and tears rose up into the eyes of the Biles glitter red, white and blue, when he once wrote his playbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of revant from four years ago, when he was in a divided third place, but lost his pross in a new Mustafina.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, called \"the father-in-law\", was clearly in charge.
He sent air suits to the public after his permeable performance to the emotional threat of return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles comes, this widespread twitting from the age of 19 will have a whole new meaning for this week:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot when they were listening to music in the car.
Two women and 12-year-old girls sat in the car to talk and listen to music when they were shot and reported on Thursday's police release.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis were shot in a car parked on a driveway on 12 June.
The information says that the shooter on the passenger side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the death of a three-year-old doesn't seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take the purses or the second adult victim's $2900.
The Phoenix Police representative, Detective Jonathan Howard, said that shooting led researchers to see if it was connected to the four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, which have been carried out mainly in the Latin American district.
\"These are in front of the home in the residential area,\" Howard said earlier this month to CBS' subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several means of transport, such as brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the end of the 1990s, white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that they were made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was in a hospital later on in the hospital because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene of the event.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release that occurred only half an hour before the death of a three-way van, which was targeted at an empty open van, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The scientists found the bullet seals, the bullet seat, and the bullet chippings from the engine space.
Mother of 6 years of age with microcephalia:
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike a large part of his age, Edmund is small-headed, and this is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all, of course I promised, he said.
He and his husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
My first reaction was, \"I didn't know people were still doing it,\" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walks.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some peaches.
He's walking around with help and driving a bicycle.
And he loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows me how you'd sing to me on the five-weeks in Edmund's inventions.
\"We'll teach him the sign language,\" Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language, he says that Edmund has invented some of his own figs.
Microcephalia may be caused by a number of different causes: genetics, such as Edmund, or during pregnancy, viral infections such as ash, or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects from Zika.
It's gonna be easier.
You can believe things will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The floods and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
The floods and widespread floods in Louisiana received the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that a number of rivers in the south of Louisiana as well as the Southern Mississippi flooded over their acute floods and caused widespread flooding due to extremely severe rainfalls.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that aid is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's security and emergency office, said that they would receive requests for lift-up vehicles, boats and sand jackets.
Steele said that alone in Tangipaho's county, tens of thousands of sands were asked.
The floodman will be in force until Saturday in most of the southern Louisianas.
In the opinion, the weather service said that more than three to five cents are expected to increase rain.
In southern Alabama, the flood flood was in force on Friday, when the rain continued in the mobile area.
The river Baton Rouge, near the river Comite and the River Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood ticket during the weekend.
Administrator Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood in several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lower than the flooding of the Ascension County on the river when the floods slowly fall to Lake Maurepas Lake.
On the south side of the state of Mississippi border in Liverpool, the Tickfaw River in Lousiana was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning from nine.
Pelassians are still picking people from flooding in Ami and Wilkinson districts in the southwest Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepdad were on Friday, near the gassters.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet away from his house, Beaver Creek’s water rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other half of the boy living near him warned him.
Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had not seen a bite of water so high over the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that both his family and his family have injuries and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved three of them in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the hidden nights spent on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spread, while heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the land had been completely exacerbated until the middle of the week.
The flooding of harsh rains and streets led to the rescue of the people in the province of Tangipah in their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities told us.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipahhoa said 200 homes had remained under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now under the flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained in the tide.
What and Hammond's cities have been opened up to shields for those who have been evacuated.
They get back to their homes when the water begins to fall, he said.
In the town of Hammond in the Tangipahhoa district, 20 streets were closed because of the rising water and the inhabitants were allowed to lift sands to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
“The last great flood was here in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administration.
There's going to be a case like this.
In Mississip, the emergency manager at Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said that a flat rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, the crooked houses were told that they had flooded, but so far, on Friday, there was no flood incident reported.
Keith Townson, Director of Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” said Townson, “and the rain still goes on...
\"Today, the bullets have been six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive the Philadelphia shooting
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name, Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds, including his hips, his leg, his hand and his stomach, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets, and his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition is described as critical, and several surgery has been carried out.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at local school.
Brown was one of four shootings in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One 29-year-old man was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in front of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting the status.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross-section between several shooters.
The attack type attacks, which are based on different weapons of attack, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant fight.
On the street, there were seals on both sides of the footwalk.
So it appears that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active battle, Chief Anthony Ginaldi of Philadelphia, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating the tapes of the surveillance camera.
The other six-year-old girl, she got the delusional hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is why I call this year's women's Olympic Olympics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie- Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of women of dark and Latin America at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female powers have been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is awesome.
The last Olympic Gabby Douglas surprised the Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances of three times the world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterly gymnastic programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman, who has won an individual gold in women's diversity.
And a teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation in this gym does not look like a country across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are “Final Five” (the last five), because there will be only four gymnastics in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly.
However, the reality is that gymnastics are a precious species, and gymnastics tend mainly in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competitive fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasiums are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
These clubs get all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to gymnastic families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Honey, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring a more affordable and available gymnastic training to communities where many young girls from Simone, Gabby and Laurie are inspired by numerous young girls.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (in my home town) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic species.
The gymnastics develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as the hardness, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work leaving.
This inspiration for the team makes thousands of young girls start to have gymnastics, and it's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for showing a serious \"girl strength\" by winning the Olympic team, and for blaming so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Doctors organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the members of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37 000 doctorate who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to impose an agreement, i.e. that NHS was on unknown soil, and that even small additional delays would harm the staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend working methods in order to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Medical Committee, said last night in the opinion: “The medical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially in order to speed up the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors in a balanced manner.
As long as the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement for only eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's businesses have been facing the government's lack of willingness to participate and sometimes in deep silence through the negotiations.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners are willing to continue working hard.
At the end of April, the latest strike meant nearly 13 000 delays in routine surgery and 100 000 hours of reception, while nurses and consultants were recruited to act as substitutes for doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend wage for 54 000 doctors under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners not to go to strike.
Mortimer said: “The struggle for work is very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services in a pre-prepared situation and cause concern, anxiety and disturbances for patients, caretakers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and manifestations (Whistleblowing).
The employers were hoping that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further education from the Sabbath-free, training costs, mutual recognition of the education programme, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health are respecting agreements with Marras, Himel and May BMA.
Two pounds per day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given longer to people.
Antihypertensive medicine, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
The NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and one of them gets another scene or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to a fat material accumulated in the artery’s wall, which forms accumulators.
If the clot breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood circulation from causing a heart attack.
If the clot is removed, it can pass with the blood and break down the blood circulation into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one scene have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, manufactured by the Isobritanian company, and sold by the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely.
In today’s NIC recommendation, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective prevention treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later receive a second heart attack or stroke, whose consequences are often devastating.
The fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, together with aspirin, is effective in calculating the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to increase available treatment options for a number of thousands of people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft recommendation does not recommend treatment for longer than for this period.
The culture of political regularity allows for the flowering of elections in Muslim regions
The former mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year because of corruption, giving a blow to the government report.
The culture of political regularity has resulted in the widespread rejection of the voting fraud in Muslim communities being ignored in the report of the government that is shocking today.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles places police, electoral officers and city councils on the fact that they have ignored evidence of electoral violence and the hypersensitivity to religion.
The former Community secretary, the current emperor of anti-discrimination, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains for the protection of voters outside voting stations.
He recommends that voters present a identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voting person be placed on the unforeseeable ink so that no one can vote twice.
I think we should better protect the publishers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for greater access to documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups to the press.
\"This would not only protect the election, but would protect the local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the election plant,\" he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the voting scandal in the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Mr Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of the accusations of numerous acts of corruption and illegality.
The Court of Justice stated that Rahman’s ‘citizens of his Muslim community’s religious feelings, and that his critics were indicted by racism and Islam.
Rahman says that he has led his election campaign on the grounds that it was a religious duty for faithful Muslims to vote on him.
Even 300 votes were depreciating or coming from the fact that a person would vote as another person.
Sir Eric said there's evidence from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern in the vote on the election position, which was said by members of the high-value Muslim community to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the identity certificate
He says in his report: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the parents’ will, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshian background.
“It was a matter of concern that... the national institutions had ignored such conduct because of 'politically correct' race and the hypersensitivity to religion.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for the cleaning of the system, which included a ban on political activists to deal with the voting flags that came out of the mail so that \"voting of votes\" would end.
The report that Theresa May looks at also requires more stringent amendments to registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Review options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting the undefeated ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationalism checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
To prevent political activists from dealing with ready-to-air sounds and envelopes in which the votes are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around the polls.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for fearing on the basis of the Reformation of the People Act in 1983.
Make photography illegal at voting venues.
Only English is used at the polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that staff retains the rule that the voter should go to the call alone.
Sir Eric has the Great London Police Force, saying that it's... amazing... that there was no criminal charges since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Court of Justice remained in Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities, ” he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticises ineffectively-rule checks at the polling agencies of city councils.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s Tower Hamlets judgment was a resurrection.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a result of Parliaments, but this worrying and lightning spread and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation.

The United States Men's Flexible Team, Mr Brady Ellison, has caused a storm on Twitter since the surface rose up in his pictures, where he seems to be scary like the Star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the passion for social media, the archbishop admitted that he had heard of Leo since he was a child.
\"I don't see a great deal of impossibility, except maybe with a duck, Brady told Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the alarming equity of Britain's long-term hips between Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastic Alya Mustefina's greatest, prominent eye has been said to be a Cuban singer of Gloria Estefan's double life.
And in the pool, Southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to the glee star Matthew Morrison for years.

Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches the Gabrielle Union's smile.
The CBC Olympic Commander is sorry to say that the Chinese swimmer is dead like a pig.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message of women's 4x200-metre free swimsuits made the CBC's direct Olympic broadcasters angry on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company, CBC, had to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race that during a 14-year-old Chinese lady's mask was degraded like a bad smell and dead like a pig.
The reporter Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions with women at 4x200 meters of free swim in the newsfin.
MacDonaldi, who came to CBC's screening team to bring the color, was heard saying: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese piggy, baby.
He's too eager, he's gone like a bad smell, he's dead like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, hurried the second part at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, which allowed Canada to capture China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly to the language used and its tone on the internet after shock.
Emmett Macfarlane said, \"Did the CBC reporter just say that China 14-year-old swimmer was like a pig?\"
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission.
China Ai Yanhania was described in the women's free swimsuit 4 x 200 meters of the message formula as follows:
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was solid and fast, challenging him by many.
Twitter's users didn't arrest themselves when they heard how unsatisfied Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran a shipment of CBC, apologized to MacDonald's comment in direct transmission, saying: “We are calling for a comment on the performance of swimming.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that it did.
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had twited the answer to the comment.
Scott Russell, with the reporter, had to apologize for MacDonald.
Then CBC copied and added an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published the opinion.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers for an apology and our followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for his message.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized for the direct transmission and tried to define his comments by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“ At this moment I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s message, ” he said at the CBC Olympics.
I took the swimmer to perform, not as a person.
\"It's not necessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry...
Primark's client of a stunned woman who made her underwear in the middle of a trade
The customers didn't know what to look at when a woman got caught up in the middle of Primark's business to try underwear.
The things that didn't improve when he assessed what he looked like in his pants, the woman peeled them out of her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to spin and finally made four underwear in a store that was located at the Bouvere Place Shopping Center in Folkeston.
Primark's movement at Bouvere Place Shopping Center at Folkeston, where she made a pair of underwear and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother Jenny Davidson, who was in the store, said that when she tried underwear, a mysterious woman dressed again and walked away without buying anything.
He said, \"The people didn't believe in their eyes.\"
The woman stood in the middle of the trade floor, took a pair of underwear on the front, took off her own socks and underwear and put her matching legs on.
He didn't even try to find an isolated place for reconciliation, he just stood there shameless.
\"All looked, while he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them, because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three more couples before finally decided that he did not like what he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying underwear that he was making up for.
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent's town, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is taking his home underwear, which someone else has tried, but has not been cleaned.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove clothes from the sale after she left, which is all right.
\"It would be a terrible thing to go home with new underwear and find out that another woman has dressed them on top of them and taken them off, and they have not been washed up.
Primark’s representative said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone’s movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale:
This way you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the Grand Master of Krav Mag Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with the pysy-crapers in the near future.
Then you were approached in front of or behind, this video will show you how to pay the attacker at the same time.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached, the first thing you need to turn is to see your attacker and strip the line of fire.
Then you'll catch a gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on your face with your free elbow.
Continue hitting on the knee, and when the attacker goes to pain the rifle, turn the gun from his hands, hit him with a gun on his face and back with a gun pointing at him.
If the armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, tap the weapon and turn it around so that the criminal can't launch.
At the same time put pressure on the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun on his hand, back off and point him at the gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video, how Mizrachi does this, exactly.
But remember, if you're not the headmaster of Krav Mag, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for the travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and nightiest places.
Ian Wright, 51, a runner from Suffolk, an arrow in euro banknotes, a cadet in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet license and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before she was licking every target, she used a metaphor to show herself and us the situation she was going to be in.
The experiment that was made on the trail of the film called Internal Force, however, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train that thousands of people use may seem completely repugnant, but, in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the sink in the kitchen.
On his way to Europe, Wright continued to talk to doctors and medical professionals about the confirmation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him in the mouth of another bad taste.
Wright became a well-known tester of the sustainability of his bowel when traveling all over the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from public railway stations to the Wc-steel licence machine, was indeed tested by his immune system.
In a film made, he said: “From the time of my life, I’ve been rather concerned about my health, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from the soil, the worms, and the water.
He did confirm his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the unclean Russian public toilet.
In his sample, he had over 4,000 units in his photometre.
Based on the comparison, the number of antibodies should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public visit, he refused to lick when the result of the photographer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the hands of the defendants is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, on the tracks of inner power, together with a Finnish makeup, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said: “This is almost the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in the toilet.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna do anything about it because there's something to stay here.
The tracks of internal power were produced together with the Finnish makeup, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D vitamins that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuoremaa, director of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking, \"Let's do it for Ian.\"
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell our everyday environment about good and bad bacteria, about the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary picture gives us an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I also think that the document shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the document, added: \"Let's say it now, even though this is the case: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, as I had asked for a night-night Russian visit in the film, I would have lost respect for him.
It was easier for Ian to understand some of these things, while some of them were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows.
In a survey carried out in 2015, 84% of respondents were specifically associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that they at least use products with added lactic bacteria.
The love family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall's Saltashi before the wedding.
The gay family caused 50 000 pounds of damage to their rental house after they were evicted because of the terrorism of the neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltashi after they had been complained about many times.
Once they were removed from the property by means of force, the shocked residents of the housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
On the wall there had been amplified openings, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor, and the walls had been shattered with graphite.
The family has now moved away, and they are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, owner of Cornwall Houston, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for residents, and I do not think people should have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be known through the smaller groups of Cornwall.
This family is degraded, and their name is degraded.
There were three boys who lived between the property, and according to the police, the family's fear was a streetfight in nestlands, the fear of close residents, drug use, drug sales and excessive yelling, quarreling and blackmailing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the fire were found with old waste.
The property that had previously been transferred to drugs, the floorboards had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing married the strength of a woman and her partner's property this week after giving them a extended period of time, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The mild neighbors thanked for their wedding, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said: \"They didn't care about anyone.
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here a lot of times.
- This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here... we haven't used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone...
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Cornwall Houston neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
Family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on a wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his or her own conduct, because the wedding is always the last practice that Cornwall Houston considered.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and the Cornwall police and the courageous members of the community who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property in different times, but they were all in twenty.
Once the wedding is done, one bedroom is filled with dirty pillow
The housing company's employees now need to clean up the waste surfaces around the house
In 2014, the police made a raid in real estate and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as foam, supplies and 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received fines after giving his guilt to the possession of class b drug as he intended to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners are living homeless after they're in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the walls of the house there were ashtrays.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease agreement.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said that the wedding was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message to those who think that their conduct is free of sanctions, and to those who suffer such conduct, ” he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never be able to tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Passengers in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew down the beach on a hippoline low.
Sunlighters in Portugal’s Aveir experienced a shock in their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would be wiped out from a very low plane.
Air force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, horrified tourists began to panic, as a low - flying jet wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came near the contact distance from the solar beams on the north-Portugal Aveiro.
The dragons stood up when they began to be clearly concerned about the noise from the jet, even though they did not begin to see what was coming towards them behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the numerous holidayers who published videos of dramatic bypass in social media was Daniel Fernandos, who said: “It went by twice as low, and together it seemed to be falling into the ground.
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing, and it really felt like the machine was falling on me.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared in darkness and flew down an incredible low
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the P-3C Orion pilot was a training flight designed to identify fishing vessels near the coast and that the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke of nearby earthquakes, but the air force assured me that no one was in danger.
This summer, the fires have destroyed parts of the Manner-Portugal, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions that affected the visibility, the smoke caused by the earthquakes and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training flight, the flight was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Better than expected result of the first half of the extract
In January - June, the social and health border in South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned results.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, the Exote will try to shorten the rules of action.
Exote covers the surplus of previously born deficits.
It may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The whole year's result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss a half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borderers swore a military whale in Immolola
70 guards from the Border and Marine Guard School swore a military election on Friday.
Military election was held in Immmola on Friday.
Ten special ice cream courses were organised in the sports field of the reserve.
The militaryvalan swore 70 armed men.
Special Borderers are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, ten young people were applied for.
They were called 250 for selection tests.
Special MRLs have been trained in Immmolola since 2007.
Five veterans of war-time border forces were involved in the treatment of hydrogen in connection with the whale ceremony.
The average age of those who have been involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limit of race ahead of the crime investigation will help to investigate crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police institutes in Finland, the RTA has been operating since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is out of sight.
There are four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
That's what's being placed in the Gulf, Sergeant.
Lieutenant Lahti is the chief officer.
In addition, the strength of the unit is one of the civilians dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, considers Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different investigations for the other police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Reform of recent working practices
The creation of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make the police leave more and less and less often, until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will help target daily police activities where it is most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units and each police station has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Criminal Police, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA services, for their part, work in divided areas according to the police departments, are responsible for providing information to both local police and national services.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution because it also makes crime.
RTA employees have better knowledge of basic politics.
The unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, alert mission databases and observations.
This is called sacrimation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the practice of the factor, there is a certain kind of picture.
This can be done either on the basis of an artificial or a person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city with the collars in standing, but their work is not entirely public.
As a result, professional offenders would develop their activities and thus try to prevent police criminal activities.
The police will be publicly informed of the conduct if it anticipates their threat.
This was, for example, the initial news, the signification of empty dwellings used in housing fractures.
That's where the authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a single needle or a tape with which they tried to see if the inhabitants were really on their way.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ordering protocol on the right to fly, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal the gloves in our hand.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppista from Häme police, Lieutenant Tuimo Lepola from the East Finland Police Department, Detective Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuamela from Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will help us plan practical action.
Background to the reduction of labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards the new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PURA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside its own institution and Finland.
A school girl associated with her father killed in Syria in London
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British students who left London last year to join the Isis, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasime Akunjee, said that the girl's family heard this dead Syrian Raqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed dead in a Russian air strike at Raqa, an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she just died when she was planning to escape the war from the land and return to Britain.
“It can only be hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and as a testament to others that there are real risks associated with leaving the war zone - that it could make people give up for making such a decision, ” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern school girls flew to Turkey, where they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that she had married the Isis player in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland the Supreme Court to be the candidate if he is elected
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton, a candidate for democratic President, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The head of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will choose the person to replace Antoni Scalia, a member of the Supreme Court at the very least.
Reid said on Thursday at the phone conference that he predicted... with a certain degree of certainty... that Clinton's ruling Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He thanked Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want a boat to go out with a new choice.
Garland is the head of the United States Court of Appeal District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans that block Garland's name are the Republican presidential candidate for Donald Trump's hands and potentials.
He said Trump wasn't fit in.
Treats says that the naked calendar is for women as well as for men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of the suburbs, they're going to find their next top model generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Mr. Steve Shaw, President of the Treats earlier this year, told us that his richly naked magazine differs from the old school's Playboy because \"Playboy is for men...
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them too.
“We must begin again to show timeless and classical nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked women’s body,” said Shaw in the press release, where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave photos via the network or in personal open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: Who really buys records?
Single, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush into the comment section with irritable violations, whose author has a name sign NoAllThe Middle AgesMies, notice that this argument is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of many of the recorded albums is not due to the growing enthusiasm of this millennium for the resuscitation of physical objects, but to the echo of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, all the most unlikely records are bought by the age group of 18-24-year-olds.
Moreover, it is not just a collection of amateurs, it includes a sense of feeling: older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being single (69% vs 66%).
But do you think the results of YouGov are true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit. I would be sure to make a cup out of my hands and say something of the authority, as:
Let's look into it.
At the same time, when Soho’s charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants, shops and office supplies are now filled with buildings where previously there were independent movements - the terrible, extraordinary record stores still remain.
For the following section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment when I stand very close to various men from some of these shops trying to assess by identifying their age and conscience.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (the counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (the counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London due to a meeting, and spins the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
\"I am,\" he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 albums.
These records, which appear above the picture (he sent the sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such an enormous volume of albums and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
“A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, the albums that were published when there were 11 or 12, which I was probably a little too young to buy, ” he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the albums are more likely to be introverters who enjoy their company and add: “I do not smoke and drink much.
This is my evil.
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers that he's faced are suitable for YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and have become the need to buy their old albums back.
On the basis of my discussions, people have generally lost their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl ferrets of a certain age.
But what about the alleged sign of the records?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that the record stores provide comfort for the same-sex types of the community.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly injured by the payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be ashamed of the digital world and choose to trust the lastingness of familiar discs; objects that raise the memories of the teen-age lucky days.
“I think that sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that we have to own, ” says Wez.
As a collector, too, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your thoughts.
We're like their social workers, and the other employee suddenly said about the platepin.
The April ICM opinion survey revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% of people buying vinyls do not have a record player.
This point in the news report is likely to appear to be seriously concerned about my back on my boss' nova collections.
This wake-up award is also something that Jonny, who works for the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
\"Someone came in a while ago and said, \"I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,\" he says.
It is not a big part, but it is absolutely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, \"I don't have a record player.\"
So not parents, but younger people, late people, who are just getting excited about it.
In a fapp where there is a nearly full layer of vinoylles today, I have a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-seven-year-old wigs, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and mid-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxing than in the earlier movements, it is great to see different customers with the latest sinful and sex-free pop of Wild Beast.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to demonstrate a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone in 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes watching various disks in sales.
He's doing window shopping, not spending much money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so the record collection isn't really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or on something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... she's in love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I'm trying to look into cockroaches, I observed a group of teenage girls gathered for a moment around the Polaroid cameras before my father and daughter thought about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mixture of modern music and classics, the essential albums of any central collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorations, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's purely articinyls.
But given that even a small amount of attention received by these objects can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho’s eaters for more, there is not much complaining.
It is not surprising that the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one who spends most of the luxury materials, such as vinyls.
But even though my findings suggest that youGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They really don't spend Thursday morning fighting around the record stores on Berwick Street, avoiding the look of a creepy 30-year-old fake TV driver in this throat over the shoulders of bad-looking middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the worst live vertebral animal video report

The French court rejects the application to terminate the trade in Jungle refugee camps
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to land tens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In the course of the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to clear up all 72 temporary shops, where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks within the camp, offer a hair cut or sell tea with 50 cents (40 p.m.) or sell simple food with a few Euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Agency argued that the sites should be cleared because they represent taxes on a non-paid parallel economy and because they are a fire and clean-up risk.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that trades and restaurants are vital, in other words, that free meals offered by the government and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court ordered that there were no legal grounds for the dismissal of 72 people who would be engaged in temporary trade, but said that the concern of Calais's prafty was fully understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than feeding people living in extreme uncertain conditions.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under a bite threat was camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are unprofitable and offer 200 meals daily, English and French hours, as well as asylum clinics for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - to top reading - after the arrivals rose steeply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland clearly fall faster than average in the EU
Food is very cheap in Finland to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, with an average decrease of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most among the EU countries with similar levels of pay compared to Finland.
From the analogue countries only in Britain, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in the article of Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen published in the Information & Trends bilog.
The magazine compared real assets, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” says Lehtinen.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The prices are now under pressure by the Russian import ban on food which has caused food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also had an impact on the fall in prices.
The big trade chains in the S-group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as visible promotion campaigns.
However, Finland is still not cheap food styles, even though the price of food has fallen.
In 2015, food in Finland was one of the fourth most expensive EU countries with similar wage levels in Finland.
According to the newspaper, VAT has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the Verrokki countries had the same VAT rate, food would be sold in Finland at the same wage level as third countries.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the Verrokki countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of old EU countries at food prices, VAT must be half-at EU average and price competition continued,” says Lehtinen.
The newspaper points out that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't exactly what it used to be anymore.
A returning school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new education plan has been drawn up for schools, which will be put in place at the beginning of the academic period in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan shows the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, teaching beauty writing is being abandoned, and schools are starting to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone should be active and learn each other.
This is how we try to make training more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting spine could live for up to 400 years.
The Greenland hai (Somniosus microcephalus) known for icebergs reaches the age of 150.
It can then live another 250 years, reporting a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal kingdom it is only passed by the Islamic population, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs for longer, they can grow up up up to five meters.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre per year is observed, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues found out.
He defined adults' ice cream age from 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbonism of the ophthalmologists.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish, 493 and 502 cents of the sample, were exposed to some 335 and 392 years of age.
In the previous studies, it has been found that the ice sharks only reach sexual maturity by more than four meters, the researchers decreased their number at that point in time to some 150 years of age.
Science published by the study.
Stockmann fires for almost 300 salesmen are not reduced.
Almost 300 employees will be suspended from Stockman.
The joint venture companies ended in the company that ran into difficulties at the beginning of August.
\"As a result of the consultations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant,\" says Stockmann in his report.
It says that there is no reduction in the number of traders in the goods sector so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, about 80 workers from support activities will be offered new jobs as salesmen.
The Stockmann yt negotiations concerned some 3 000 employees.
At the start of their reduction, some 380 employees were estimated to be employed.
A small reduction will aim at an annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme with a view to achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the trade in goods are underlying.
Although the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
According to the CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sale of Stockmann v. CEO has not achieved the company's objectives in the goods stores.
“Achievements are, unfortunately, necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018-, the Vejalainen notes in the press release.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly due to the success of Lindex.
Ketju achieved its second quarter turnover and results in all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year's total Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover will fall last year.
The operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature of less than 20 degrees all over the country.

There will also be rain cubes in the central parts of the country, but the southernmost one is pouts.
The temperature is no longer very summer, for the whole country remains below 20 degrees.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees remain.
Kenya’s general sports team is treating the Dopingskandal - coach’s explanation
The Kenian general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-metre star Fernando Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a country team leader in Kenya, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had issued a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities of Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan nation team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior, Kip Keino, President of the Kenian Olympics Committee, would, in turn, continue to be a news agency for Reuters.
The Olympics' general sports starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was placed last year in the World Cup on the way to the quarter and is in advance Rio's winning favours.
According to Reuters, the source of Kenya's general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race room.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to find out, the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium is evacuating to its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At Rio's Olympic Stadium, at least, they're not following general sports.
On Friday, Rio started a struggle on the medals of general sports, but the world’s top figures were presented with confusing skills for an empty audience.
On Friday, Rio’s organisers told me that only 58 percent of the tickets to the first day’s morning competitions and 65% of the tickets to the evening competitions have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulsating people.
The flags of the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The viewers of Rio’s Olympic Games have attracted attention even before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty blades have been seen in the eyes of rugby, melody and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach flying ball in the legendary Copacaba, only 70% of the watch was full.
After the Brazilian cab, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people were in sight.
At least the fact that Brazil, who is fighting in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even in the Brazil football team, the first match was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
At the weekend, the reporter Mario Andrada reported that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
\"We still have 1.1 million left for sale,\" said Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million flags of London’s Olympic Games, 8,2 million were sold, although almost half the flags were worth more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than €16.
In London's Olympic volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have provided 240 000 tickets for less well-known species, such as golf and rugby.
At Rio Stadium, there were empty places in the morning.
Even the beach flying ball in Copacaba sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralsalo competed in London in 2012.
I've had a lot of people in the papers.
New way to protect the environment - Get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation will participate in the conservation of nature through the new ways.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem holders' rights in the land area by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land from Lapland.
The country has been divided into virtual blocks that are open to the right of holders against payment.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of the size of the veto right, which means in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
There are also several areas where management rights can be acquired.
Acquisition of the right of administration is something concrete that can leave your inheritance or give you a gift.
You don't have to go and carry the banners or the handles somewhere in order to protect the environment, and the Juha Leviva fabric, who has acquired the right to control it, is justified.
The holder of the administrative authority receives accurate location data from his compartment, which enables, for example, a visit in the area.
On the Foundation’s website, the name details of the holders of holders’ rights are provided in the same map as the country block data can be found.
The canvas sees as a risk of natural conservation acquisition only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some kind of ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas in such a way that they can be inviolable and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by providing donations.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also targets Finland's borders and plans land acquisition from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in a pop up forest at the Helsinki mall on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves are tormenting the big cities, banging Turkey - see the situation in your municipality of residence
The bicycle thieves torture Turkey from large cities in Finland.
There is more round than nine in the largest city that has been stolen this year.
According to the bike thefts reported to the police in Helsinki, the number of bicycles and their parts per thousand inhabitants have been stolen in the biggest ten cities in January to August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to the police, there were four of the five wheelchairs per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's the big difference.
\"In other cities, there are double thefts in relation to the number of inhabitants compared to others, characterises police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It's extremely difficult to say why there's been stolen more wheels in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The generality of the records can be influenced by how much traffic is in the city and how much the wheel is in the top,” says Sergeant Teemu Äkäus.
The police government Tommi Reen is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise in comparison with the top.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a busy center, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where urban centres are distant and the bicycle is not necessarily a priority mobility tool,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police information has become a little less wheel theft in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
In spite of the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 wheels per year.
It means 50-60 each day and only around 4,000 wheels per year in Helsinki.
They're big amounts, Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only a part of the victims inform the police of the theft.
Reen calls on people to report on the theft of the bike, even though less than one case reported to the ten police.
A typical search of a bike theft is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The results can also be found in other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught on their own weekly mission or in connection with police investigation, says Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, a round is being stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoors, warehouses, and wheelchairs, in practice everywhere where they are usually kept.
For individual bike models, most are stolen like Jopos in previous years.
The U-hole gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up selling online, for example.
They will remain on the domestic market.
At least the police have not come to know that the stolen wheels would go much abroad,\" Reen says.
According to the police, stolen wheels are common Finnish.
I'm sure some of you will buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be precise, as he may be guilty of a cover-up offence or violation.
\"The alarm bells should be played if they sell 16 wheels in their clear fields,\" Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special author of the library, carries a colourful Nopsa for his working day at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
She's had five pieces of bike, but none has been stolen, Hirvi tells me. “It's never been taken, it's been a good monk.
“ Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, but it does not necessarily have a hipster value, ” the Helsinkiic Horvi thinks.
In the box in Kallio, Helsinki, the quick-to-do Sibi Valve locked its bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike snuffed against the wall, but usually the Valve lock his bike in something solid, like a wheelchair.
“There is much to think about, for this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have to say, the Helsinki student says of his white bike, which the hull alone cost about five hundred euros.
\"The whole time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken...
- Mostly the bad ones, the dirty boys, the bad ones.
A bike was stolen from the guard from the house company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked, Valve could expect it to be replaced.
Under 15 years of responsibility for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-review crews from the United States
In Helsinki, we will try the so-called peer-light crew to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Firstly, the experiment will be applied to people under 15 who are now under criminal liability.
We're missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the jury will discuss the crime committed and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-review crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter to the family, for example, explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are directed in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes down from the first mistake, ” says Laitio.
A model for the Vertaisval crew has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, will not be in front of an adult panel, but will reflect on what happened to people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The Service Design Office, who followed the course of the service form of Palmu, Ikka Lovio, tells us that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
\"It's been a message to continue on the road you chose,\" Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalam crew is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me- Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those who need them, not just for immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
The newspaper of the United States news Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his incompetence, incompetence and record indiscriminateness, threaten to bring to these elections a sound curve to the Democrats,” says Politico.
Only the direct orientation of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump's ornamental anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is meant to be sent in the next week.
Among the undersigned are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons involved in the letter is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, which is opposed to Trumpi.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want to protect the party's majority in Congress and that it is not anybody's support.
A number of Donald Trump's actions are listed in the letter, which are believed to be a violation of millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authorityary tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democrat Hillary Clinton, candidate for democratic President, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of USD 275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handicraft for American duunas, who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that rich people would have to pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to become a tax collector, it has to pay the tax on departure, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he had before supported.
I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages, as President of the Court of Justice, Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the Republicans' Donald Trump's financial programme, which was published on Monday, for only millions like this.
In the past, Clinton has appointed Trump's posars for a reduction in the amount of the Roma proposed by Trump.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America, Clinton was hiding.
These are Rio's viewers: Kisses have not glued Finnish tracks, but mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports games are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympics in Rio have so far not reached the peak audience.
At one time, the races have glued 12% of the population at the top of the screws: Tuesday night swims were followed by 615 000 viewers from the Olympics of Yle at the same time.
Due to the comparison: the EM games in general sports received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2 a month ago, and the EM games in football were fairly another million.
The most interesting of the Olympic species has so far been the cycling of Sunday night and the fifth day of the contest opened a teenage gymnastics, both reaching almost half a million viewers on the Olympic Canal at one time.
Top Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures and reminds us that viewers are first divided into several instruments in Rio's Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
Television players are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports games that Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The viewers are smaller than in the 2012 London Competitions or in the 2008 Beijing Competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's competitions will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for a limited interest - if it is now considered to be a lam - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first fight, the interest would have been a pompped up with it.
In addition, general sports is just about to begin, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
At first, according to Pokkisen, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sports starts, the viewers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for competitions, which rose to Apple App Store on the first day of the contests for the most free application.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're on the road to 200 grand already.
\"We'll only get the numbers of the viewers later,\" says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users in the best way.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio are more visible in Ylen channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem can monitor some species, and the radio Yle Püe communicates the races daily.
Olympiacs are not only perhaps the most laborer of Yle ever, but also the last ones that you can only follow from Yle's channels.
From 2018 you will see the Olympic Sports in Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deep lake is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical training teacher, found a printing paper of about 20 square meters from Ristisel, which was based on a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation by echoing it.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says the Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So until now, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres of Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the sun.
Especially the base of Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
It could well be found in unknown depths, Kannela thought.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As far as you are concerned, your sun is not able to reach ten deeper parts, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Self-employed in the tax sector: Tax on pensioners is becoming more and more stringent.
The taxation of pensioners remains more severe than that of employees.
The individual says that the disadvantage came under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to equalise pay earners.
This is not included in the presentation of the government.
We think it should definitely be.
The promises given should be followed after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners became unemployed, reducing taxation.
In the Parliament, the case heated the opposition's representatives, who were exacerbated by Mr Alexander Stubb, Minister of Finance, on election promises.
It's safe to buy, it's not growing.
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Mr Petter Orpon (Kok.), tax reductions are mainly about protecting and increasing purchasing power, since next year wages are not increased.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the desire of Prime Minister Juha Sipila (middle) and Orpo's messages to respect the competitiveness agreement reached at times.
He says that holding the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government term.
It has been done with the power of social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It will be needed because the economy is so much for domestic demand and for people's own future.
In the event of prolonged unemployment
An individual appeals to the government that it would take on long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, long-term workers were about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth is not stopped, the government's objective of rising employment rate is to 72% run away.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, the permit has a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in Thailand’s attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to observe and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish tourists who are going to be in Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the precautionary instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, very few Finns are currently in Thailand, although it is difficult to assess their exact number.
The Thai travel period of Finns is up to one year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after bombing.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's not yet any information on the impactor.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be a Constitution for the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and for the last week's referendum on the military train.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
People who reported opposition to the law were arrested in the country, among other things.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic-citizen conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He says that the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very little.
The impact on the day would have a profound impact on the safety of the authorities.
Thailand Police: In school it is not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are local sabotage and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, says the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in the popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of Finns, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs blew up by the paper at Strong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bombs.
In addition, at the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for through it they are transported to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the impact is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the warden of the military regime in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic any more, he said to the journalists.
According to Gen Prawitz Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to observe and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who are going to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the precautionary instructions, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known very little so far.
Last night's hit in Hua Hin has been given a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian among the wounded.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs blew up the bell tower that was known to be visible.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin into the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Dead Than bomb was hidden under the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewing CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded at about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four fight
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina's third on 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for tennis championships in Rio's competitions with permanno, jumps and booms.
Biles has managed women's exercise to a large extent over the last few years.
He had eight personal World Championships from the last three years.
He has won the four-to-one championships he won three times in a row, and last and next year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two teams of world championships.
It's hotter MM-metals for Biles with a jump and a boom.
Thailand Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism –
In Thailand Phuket, Esa Huovila, a real estate agency and children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, assess Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many tragedys in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then an avian influenza, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these past ones haven't escaped tourists, it's hardly this either.
Huovila's company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard from her own employee.
A worker called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the ranch and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work this morning as usual.
They thought that the roads had been set up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's celebration in Thailand.
The Patong tunnel was calm and the main blind movements were allowed to open about 10 o’clock at local time.
A lot of people on the beach had never even heard of the blows.
In half three days, Thailand’s time at Patong was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been pretty small, says Huovila at the scene.
Later, this car was seen in the Kruunupy with Jouxholmint.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for a description hidden in a nearby six.
Another man got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
On Friday, a high-value leadership change was made in Russia over the years when President Vladimir Putt fired the head of his administration, Mr Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a viroid 44-year-old Anton Vato.
He's an ex-graduate and he's been working as Ivanov's second-man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the release of Ivanov may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from colluding with the president's independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught or screwed with other directors.
Assembled Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of the Putin's internal border, is moving to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
By means of a tape presented by the national media, Putin referred to the amendment as a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other assignments and proposed a return to the Nano, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniem of the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change his immediate circle younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfa Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdishists received about 90% of the important city of Manbij last week.
It is estimated that tens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.
The corrected news was corrected at 7:30 p.m.: We were wrong to tell you that the civilians were running from the city, and the Isis fighters actually kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Legality of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
According to Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that it cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to give the list of participants of the interior minister's opportunities to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the Government's Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounts.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that there is a need for a reform of practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
Like last few years, Bolt's been running against time under valuables.
He violated his cover from the early days and had to leave the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and it's the key issue, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale samba dancers and fans who became fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by a footnote that the Jamaican star has risen in the period when the general sport has fought with doping scandals and a loose interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he hurried out at the beginning of the 200-foot race at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise to slow down the injuries and loose your training weapon.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the independence of competitors in the time of 9,69.
This is harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the jurisprudence clock.
World record in Berlin at 9.58 hundreds and 19.19 two hundred are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of service, but no one but Bolt believes in its birth.
Sassala Bolt's very challenging is Athens 2004 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not been lost in the finale of the valuables once if he has only made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th MM-final left Bolt without running because of the lightning spill.
Bolt will fill in for a long week after 30.
He's an old man in a young man's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last finish line of career, Bolt, has set the next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Advertises from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping crime
According to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18 has provided a positive doping sample in Rio's Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian drinks Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Kenian general sports coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epoetin hormone.
He was placed in Rio for a quarter in a woman's 100-foot butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sports.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xiny's on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other dopings have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenia, on the other hand, has been sent home from Rio to the general sports coach because of the doping crime.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenian coach had been a athlete in the test situation and had issued a doping test for this.
According to the media, it's Kenian short-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using the race pass of the 800-meter runner left in the situation.
Phelps can't stop any historical gold from coming into the screen style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., was swimming in the 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic Games in the fourth consecutive competitions.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion until China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, but Helen Skelton of the BBC Olympics is laughing at the ants interview in the East Magazine.
Helen Skelton (oik.) on Monday is one of the most listed pages of this week on the website of the newspaper.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if the somessa or the British press have a small spot on his exposed and special costumes.
The TV is a visual media, he's stressed.
Skelton's dressed in high-level shoes and has a dress that must have at least enough visibility - at least for the eyes of a number of conservative British soldiers.
However, the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and little cases are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton will want to scare you, and maybe he'll be ashamed, but he's pressing that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the case has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers are doing and how big sacrifices they're making is for me, Skelton's cheering up.
You know what?
It's a pain in the ass if it comes from dressing (a driver).
I'm just a little amused if this is someone's radar hit me.
Rio's police have two arrests for a terrorist suspect.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it had arrested two people for the suspicion of terrorism.
The police arrested the competitions in case of security oversight.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.

A lady in Argentina dressed Pejó-Siren, a Finnish thought in protest.
The wind at the Petőri-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The wind of Pejó-Sire was on Thursday.
The lady of Argentina dressed Tuuli Pejari-Siren on Thursday at the women's surfing day opening in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted a breach.
He was stuck because of the cholari, and the others ran away, the Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete thought of protest for a long time.
It wasn't worth doing, then, because it would have been useless according to the Olympics' rules.
I should have dropped into the water so I could have been credited, Pető-Siren said.
The Finnish was hanging on his desk until the last time he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish became 27nd place with the cholari.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympics team has eight.
The cholari had little effect on the heel.
Friday is an important day when you're out of 10-12.

7 specific issues which, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to the life of a person.
Some things include ways that affect the health of a person, whether directly or indirectly, in such a way that his life is extended.
Once again, things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
Such are, inter alia, a tendency to central body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can extend age.
You don't always have to cut it, you know, just get a milk can.
Long-term secrets have been sought to solve many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strangeest research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
The study at Harvard University noted that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the risk of reduced death, particularly with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Once again, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that suggest that the use of a courtroom - one of the three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers were older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of a toothache can extend the life of a person even for more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infection.
They can help to break up other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study in Norway showed how laughing affected the lives of man.
Over 54 000 people were watched by the project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to survive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, many studies show that health benefits.
In addition, it can extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he should also get an orgasm.
Mobility will bring additional years, and it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require an absolute solvency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large back, cholesterol levels were lower.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same investigation brought these issues into the lower mortality rate.
It was then a athlete or an actor who won the Olympic medallion, who is more likely to live longer than usual bully.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life back to years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the social status of a person is the result of a long-term age, which, for its part, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study to determine the behaviour of shopping more than 65 years old found that a person who was shopping every day was likely to become older than those who were shopping less frequently.
This is due to the fact that circulation in specific stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping has no effect.

On Friday night, there was a serious truck and a nocchallenge in the passenger car.
The accident occurred in Koske, mid-Friday between Kosken and Sorvaston.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car who had received it was on the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck fell on its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car fell in the stream and then passed over the door to the roof.
The woman who carried the passenger car in 1972 remained in her car.
The Rescue Institute removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University of Turku Hospital.
The results of the female blow test were 2.02 promilla.
He's suspected of a gross rat drink.
The mail sent bulk boxes to the wrong city.
At Salon K-Citymarket, there were flaws in the box selection because the mail had delivered part of the load to the Walloon by accident.
Teija Halti, who lived in Pernisö, was on Thursday to buy depots from Salon K-Citymarket when she hit a funny sign in her eyes.
Unfortunately, there's a product shortage in the ivy because the Posti delivered our load to the Walloon!
We'll get more when Posti gets delivered!
So if you don't break in the lawn bowl, it's locked in the sign.
The sticky sign of the merchant is linked to the expansion of Posti's services last spring in order to touch lawns.
Ruohonlekukukuku is on the Post offer until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the attic.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that has been raised is incredible, Halti wonders.
On Friday night, Halltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a box of chandeliers, even though a few camps were empty.
The Jaakko Kaides, who was responsible for the operation of the transport services of Posti Company, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanonom.
The background is that the three of the five sets were lost in the wrong place yesterday (Sinajoki) and we were no longer going to do the partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stage today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanonom.
It was the first night of the evening news.
You know, you know, you know, Halti didn't get upset by the sign because she found out that she'd pick up all her own looseware.

Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project.
I get the strength and zeal of your images when you're on the same journey, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos to make it now on a project.
At that time, he told the newspaper he wanted to finally get into a normal weight of 10 kilos.
In three months of a gymnastics, five pounds fell.
Wishing for a family of a woman murdered by a coward: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovava, hopes that the victim would be remembered by a donation for police work instead of flowers and aggressives.
The Sipoo Animal Health Agency has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and that he had also completed his training there.
The veterinarian's office will remember with words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work in fear.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily to the acquisition of secure links.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old local woman was murdered in her own house in Lovada's Koskenkyly.
The female neighbors have said that the victim of the evening newspaper was very animal-rich.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man with a murder suspect didn't know a woman and they had no contact with each other.
The killer's tracking was accompanied by a police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
But Börje survived, and he's recovering.
The Court of Justice sent Post a judgment on the infringement of the Act of Equality
The post had no right to arrest the employee who refused to familiarise with the temporary staff, to assess the right of the judge of Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
Posti was ordered to pay most of the paid employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only a part of his salary, which was responsible for the whole day's work.
According to the Court of Justice, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the equality law.
The employer had complied with the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics concerning the ban on training.
During the last November post office, the PAU decided that Post workers would not be familiar with renting workers who broke the strike.
It's the first thing you've told me about the Kansas News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (medium) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his previous letter to Sipil and Soini, the Federation of Journalists asked for their concerns for Turkey's freedom of expression and press freedom.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly tell Finland that the importance of freedom of the press and expression has been highlighted by Turkey.
Putin fired the chief of his administration in his place as a virtuous Naso
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, reports the Kreml.
The situation will be the son-in-law of the Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Vaano, Anton Vaano.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the President's Administration since 2012.
It will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the Kreml report, the Ivanov, which is a member of the deep internal border of Putin, will be transferred to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another task and proposed the Nano to replace it, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying on KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin re-elected in 2012.
The BBC: Tossing ManU to a game ban... can't be seen in the opening of Valoliiga
You can't see a football player in the field when England's Valoliga kicks into the weekend.
Paul Pongba's ban was followed by England.
As a result of Paul Pogba's play ban, Manchester United's acquisition is on the website of ManU against Bournemouth on Sunday, told BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian Seura Pogba.
However, the England Football Association FA keeps him out of play because Pogba was a burden on Juvenile.
He received two warnings in the Italian cup last season, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pongban's next staff is on the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
At Flow, the big-time madness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the position of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event, marked by the world’s world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festar diggers have typically expressed themselves by wearing their own clothes.
One of the main artists is the punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is set with artificial grass and art installation.
It has never been enough for us to have just a head and a bow, says the artistic leader of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will take place in Suvilahde Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to events of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: In what event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's pretty different in the production of events that we think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year with 5 000 people.
Some interesting domestic and foreign artists are also seen here today.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is a way to fund it in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is directed in a vast way.
That's not what we want.
Over 13 years, the ideologicals of a successful event have been embroidered in such a way that 130 performers, art engineers and numerous restaurant points and drink bars have been partially shattered.
In addition to the main and smaller stage ships, 15 000 tents operate this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a big deal, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for doing this is that today’s great visions are practically possible.
During the early 2000s, activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's share company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It enables you to do things like the construction of that 73-metre tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by wearing their own clothes.
In addition to the musical event, trendy young adults can be discussed in the community.
However, the event has not been clearly profiled as a particular form of fashion.
We want to break up, above all, with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s dignity: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the legend of a bunch, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own gene, but he does not have it the most typical performer with Indian music, pop music, flute and solo.
According to Kallio, Iggy was failed because it is probably the last time we see this on the job in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and in recent years he's done a hell of a good job.
The bombings on Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the flower bags... the tourists fled in their horrors.
At Hua Hin, there were two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in the flower suit and exploded with the help of the cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, told the police representative of Samomer Yoosumran CNN.
From 1989, a wild animal protector, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to a much-blown picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it right here.
At least 11 foreign tourists were injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish tourists Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs at Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns popular on Phuket Island blew up two bombs.
No one's knownly dead.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
Also, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken action by criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will begin in a military situation first to fight.
In an acute military situation, the armed forces will only be ordered after several months of swearing the military light, says the Central Finnish.
According to the Secretary of Defence Training, Prime General Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5,5 months of service in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Education, the service is first assigned to reserve owners belonging to the standby forces.
No backup or reserve owner shall be assigned a task without required training, says Sonnninen.
In the past summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin to train backups for immediate preparedness units next year.
When necessary, units may be used for military action already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a big replacement from homehouse.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, Pauli Waroma, have won the rough dispute from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a double house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious problem of moisture in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and requested a discount from the seller.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the cart and the courtroom.
The court brought the judgment on the case on Wednesday.
It was in force for a judgment of the District Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a discount.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal and judicial proceedings.
The right to adjudicate a little because some of the household repair needs had already been known to the purchasers when making the dwelling.
The apparent construction errors, however, were significantly more serious than those presented, according to court law.
Tola was looking for a home of good fortune.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically sought a home of good fortunes because they did not want to take repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was built in good condition and that there was no harm to the points mentioned in the rehabilitation report.
The Court’s report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters along the rock mines.
However, it was not apparent from the discussions that it would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that the rainwater from the rock might have to be slightly controlled within a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the audit carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses were due to both the rainfalls of the rock and the capillary rise of the land.
On the west side of the house, the air that was contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, be released through the receipt to the indoor premises.
There was a well-equipped homecare room, a basement staircase, a living room window manager and a basement washing room that enables health risks, limit values or skis.
The blades were built without permission
The Court also contested whether the dwelling had been expanded against the permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision taken by the City of Espoo before the trade, according to which the permit had been made against the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were central to justice.
On the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, according to the court’s right, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waromah felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection.
The parties have not failed to explain their obligations, but the court observes in its judgment.
Karma archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In his recent article of Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Anderson writes how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, have recorded documents on microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SSmen.
Most women are German, but they also involve Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are originating from the racial office in Nazi Germany.
The racial office was under Heinrich Himmler, SS Director.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he had been examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Anderson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
Among other things, the Rotu agency examined women's backgrounds by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial office a handbooked life stories and good recommendations from the close.
The Rotu agency wanted guarantees that women were very rich, very wealthy, and good national socialists, who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bride for SS men.
There is no record of the 14 Finns found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a program supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme provided for inter alia that each SS person should have four children, either in marriage or outside of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, but the pages of the U.S. holocaust museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother's honour was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and non-Aryans were legally prohibited, says on the pages of the museum.
The sixth of the beast-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed in the third sails of the Finnjollian Day's first visit to Rio's Olympic Games, but remained a whole set of tails on the second day leaving.
Nirkko rose to eight times after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
The wind of Pejõri-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class days 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Pejó-Siren is six.
In the 470 class, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening school of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in place 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulin was recorded at the night of a couple of hours: \"I was so in the trunk...
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's barmaid to the thong of 1995, Finland's best sold soloartist as well as the star of dance ships and festivals, Sillanpää continues to be snooped and is at present at a whirlwind.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of her life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the head of the bridge rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tangokuin krona in the Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tanks, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tank with a slightly different shape at the request of the Sillanpää man.
One of the most popular pieces of Finnish music history was the Satulinna item.
The book says, however, that the recording of the songs did not go exactly according to the plans: The head of the bridge sang it on a tape in a terrible crash and only after a few hours' sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the trunk!
The head of the eye remembers in the book.
A great hit about the tatilation of a song would not immediately think it was sang in a hangover.
Although I wasn't at my best physically, it was still good.
I learned that it is not necessary all the time to insist on being perfect and perfect.
Another occurrence related to the most popular pieces of man, which is mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from her sillo partner and the case finally ended up in the texts of the gold box, which was published as single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Sarah’s Sõmäs were not as much as Sillanpää would have wanted.
The head of the bridge had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the copy telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, Jar and the ex-serious distinction were explained as the reason for Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a full Santa Claus and did not keep it in place.
According to the book, Jari called the record and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it and good.
In June, too, the British surprised themselves by voting out their kingdom from the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the voting week's opinion measurements predicted the opposite result.
The British economis and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the power current of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the former President of the United States Bill Clinton election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid,\" flew to the collapse of the British Brexit vote.
The Economis were shocked when their voice wasn't.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important political issue.
The Economic Cheharan language
The Centre for Macroeconomics is playing in the latest monthly interviews with a professional experience in response to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economs and the voters did not listen because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British side.
Many also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economiscist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, as the consensus of the economis did not sufficiently raise.
In particular, they were discouraged by the BBC's equality, which provided equal room for only a few percent of the economic scientists in favour of the European economist, as well as the overwhelming majority.
It was not interested in telling the EU's hostile press what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic masterpieces were concerned about the consequences of the difference.
Those far-reaching book combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economis' messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not have common interests.
The academics like economists would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also a economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrant drags your hospital, Immigrant uses you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every waiting room at the health centre sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British have medical days if they weren't there?
There are children in every school, including immigrants.
How much easier would the real British children get to school if they got rid of them?
Each municipality has foreign residents.
How much more space would it be if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did succeed, their answers did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are the net contributors of British public finances and their consumption will create jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund was reserved for Brexi in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Acet Management, whose real estate investments are the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was booked in time for Brex to draw up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result was no, was put to the profit of plan B, or an EU-wide camp.
As a matter of fact, investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on day 23, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says the only open-ended day of Aberdeen's estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the fund was worth HUF 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all the open real estate funds of the British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, real estate funds were earmarked for Brexit in a very different strategic way.
The funds closed the trade
When the camp in favour of the difference in the EU won, Europe got confused.
However, few weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, Standard Life, he frozen his trade.
These together robbed the situation and raised it to the main interests of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it finally had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not really close the trade, but changed the pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
It has been quite even since then, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out, for example, that there has been no similar crash in the Manner-Europe funds of Aberdeen.
But there was a lot of questions.
Unsatisfied attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds were taking an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds, which were closed, account for about four percent of British property.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds for 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been narrowed down, but the situation does not seem more severe to Aberdeen.
The major issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
The price and the dollar exchange rate are at its lowest price for 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The dollar player can now buy the same property at up to 30% lower.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't look so much like that.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, rose up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's where you got it.
I realized that this is going to plan B, and Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
At the office, the TV tracks that were normally set out to be silent supported the news, and usually the silent people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera this morning to tell us about his difference.
When the market opened, the display choices were just red.
It was the morning that he never thought he was alive, says Vanhanen.
It is not for this reason that, despite myllery, Aberde, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, ended on the day following the Brexit vote, which is, by chance, two real estate stores.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company was well equipped for an alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started on repair
The vote was followed by a storm.
It broke down. The British leadership went on the switch.
The market started to anticipate severe falls on the British real estate market, and in particular in London.
London office accounts were expected to reach up to 20% of mines in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now, the poison's cooled, but there's still some uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not look like the last summer holidays on the old man's face in Helsinki this week.
In his opinion, it is still too early to say much about what Brexit is following.
So much remains open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the first data.
The CBRE data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, prices of all London's real estate decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6,1 per cent, Vanhanen is reading.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987 and only five months had fewer figures, says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was very quickly compared with the global economic crisis that started in Lehman and the US real estate market.
The old man feels that this is not a very good illustration, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that, but the willingness to sell liquidity to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's also a normal financial guarantee.
The repairs could have been in the face of any case.
As a matter of fact, he's not a miracle about the price correction... that could have been in the way of Brexit without him.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of buildings in London and other parts of the world have been too high for many years.
For two years now, we have said that City and, in particular, offices are overrated, says Vanhanen.
So the fall began very high.
London's prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, the population of London is also growing.
The second big trend is that the real estate is the last class that is globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have come to the market and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new ones.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhasen, debt shortages have now been used clearly less than during the boom prior to the crisis in 2008.
Turn it off, spread it out.
In London, the rise in prices was settled last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn-out to be expected, and now it's here.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He's not afraid to judge the future, but he says that there's hardly any rises in the promise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or even way forward.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we're gonna find out what's going on.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in a single market, it's too much for its victim.
If you've been scattered, the risks are also diverted, Vanhanen says.
The S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail
The S Group will soon know what you eat, as the Group of Commerce announced today that it would start collecting more accurate information on the purchases of its clients.
Up to now, when data have been collected for the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to dream about the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S Group is coming here after Kesko, as the information on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used for marketing.
The most efficient channel is email.
Time has rarely been prohibited by the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economy House.
According to him, Kesko's not going to react to the S-Group's registration.
Kesko classifies its client already, according to the food purchases alone, to ten groups.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they use.
The information is used for the targeted marketing of the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer programme and is not on the agenda.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer programme, which can be found in the Electantalos, Siws and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not collect information at product or group level, we will remain at the final level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and on the day, and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, it is planned to reform the customer programme in the future, but the close trade will tell us about it later.
Ora does not, however, authorise the registration of product data.
Try at first
The SOK customer register and customer register have so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, education, housing and child birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The date and time, place, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded in the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, the information provided by the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time, customers have had the hopes that marketing could be more focused, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of customer and partner activities of SOK.
The S-group says he'll inform his clients of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the website of the S-Group.
For example, the cats are unable to access the data, to stress Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-litter is Tull's latest dog injury - the penis becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador Outer’s kid is snooping five boxes of the same country at Helsinki Airport.
It will not go long when it is determined to sit next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite game.
From the box that Heila sat next to, there was a shattering seal on the square gas.
The flu is the first smell that Heila has been trained with, says Suntio, owner of Heila Dog.
Safety situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for arms and explosives in Tull and is placed at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as needed.
However, the airport will be the main job for Heila, since the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have resulted in measures in Tull and after the attacks have been confirmed, says Tulli’s inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second access to training for weapons and explosives is to receive mail via the Helsinki Airport.
As a result of an increased Internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent annually through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs has made online shopping at Helsinki Airport, about 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as the discovery of their starting materials.
Heila is coming to work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate recorded baggage and mail.
There will be a great deal of benefits in the future when it can go through large container areas and spot areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the test, Customs will assess whether arms and explosives will increase in the future.
Grönberg wishes to respond to the idea.
School with the Church
Heila-pennus training is coordinated by Tull's dog school in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila, with police and defense experts.
The police have a strong experience in training dogs and defense expertise on explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila will always be trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have Tullin's six drug dogs and a cash and drug dog Mass.
Labrador donor Heila has been chosen from a ten-adventurous puppy.
The selection criteria of the dog to be selected on the airport include a raid and a hunting visit, as well as a peaceful one, since the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close associate to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila to get home, Suntio laughs.
The fine-ass orders go to Heila for once.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanome will lose the camera's mike cover for the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy-looking shield from the instant-irti-command.
Work dog hard competition
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can see jobs in Helsinki Airport next year if everything is planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot be able to iron the dog on top of the labor tapes, like Suntio.
The cost of one job dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owners.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working shares last only ten minutes for two hours.
There's a lot of competition in Tull.
Heila's owner was about 20-30 Tull's employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a job before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministry received its first Olympic medal - the people will have a day off
The Olympic Games in Fiji, less than a million inhabitants, are valued at the country's height so high that the government has appointed the 22th of August as a national holiday.
According to the Earth’s broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the case when the championship was solved.
The day after the team's return, we'll have the day after that.
The hero team is also authorised to celebrate in their own country.
The Fiji Rugby Team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the finals were observed in the country in Suvala, where the scene had been set up.
Normally, only the Nazis are interested in rugby, but this game was united by our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging, said the Fiji Times supplier to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish winner passed out after the work
In his last attempt, Milko Tokola succeeded from 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the cracks, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of hit.
His common result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her job in the last 175 pounds, as well as in the second.
With the third company, the weights rose as a result of a bitter scream.
The cranium was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the raise.
The joy of the Finnish Creator was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a viroist Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The men's football player, Mr. Rovaniemen Palloseura, has concluded a long-term agreement with the Estonian eater Albert Prosa.
We're looking for our team's top player with the power and threshold to come to Finland and Raveniem with a small threshold.
With over ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players around the world.
The small crowd began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, the RoPS Coach Juha Malinen told me in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrive at RoPS from the stable Flora, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinjajo where the Ravaniemians meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, his last - season governor, moved to Australia.
The happy Modern Family Star meets again: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern Family Media series, known as Alex Dunphy, will once again be shattered by showing its proud body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much of a imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the actors' legs but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and use much more courageous.
The star has developed a number of tattoos in the pictures published in social media, with very few clothes and numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dress up in very few costumes.
The Winter, on the basis of adultity, has recently published several pictures of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Previously this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter had changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a typical change in Hollywood form, from child star to adult.
He's been on TV for almost all his life and has grown in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more to show the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has become nervous about some of his long-term fans with an imagomic transformation.
It's not hard to guess where he's in ten years' time when he's already about as hard as he is, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Instead, some of the women's fans are defending an actor and urges them not to care for criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration for many women, you're a young woman.
The Japanese want Nordic tourists to be lured to Finland: In autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the renovants from the beginning, Visit Finland reports the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese retreading.
Revon lights are the cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart and snowy landscapes.
There is a very high demand in the winter tours of Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revontuise season begins from early autumn and goes far beyond spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurara, where the surface of the lake is reflected by the retro lights, making two stories of random, reports Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese people living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey carried out by Aalto University and the researchers at Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive painting among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would be looking for clearer unique views of Finland, and this revonult has a huge potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland on average, says Lind.
Britain will be content with the master class that was organized by Rugbyhopean Fid, leading to gold.
The impressive development of Britain in the rugby tournament collapsed Fidz to present the last challenge in Thursday night's final, when the team experienced a 43-7 deodoro strike at the Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master class in the process of handling, breaking, drawing, supporting game, running lines and bridge when he won the gold - their first Olympic medal.
A reasonable comfort came with the Tappio from the third of the British day, and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby initiation tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Previously, the tough 7-5 victory of the semifinal played on the same day from South Africa could have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won the top 15 teams in this condition.
Great Britain may perhaps - but probably not - comfort at least one British gold medal in its neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss from Wimbledon.
Great Britain's journey has been pretty good.
Eight years ago, as Ryan trained, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This spine hurts, but progress is shocking.
Fidi started excellently fighting British battles because of interest.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had this as if they were running towards moving buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisa dived in the corner of the goal area.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right track led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great tactics stopped him from making a third goal, but it was only a slow hit for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0 destroyed.
Nakarawa once again made the goal of a new start, and the clock still had more than one minute... the earliest half-time.
After that, Vatemo Ravovokovu fell through the Great Britain's discovery and ran into a line to paint.
After the landing, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made, at a break, a dozen changes that would block Fid's dam... for four minutes, which was fine compared to the first half of the year until Joshua Tuisova made the goal after Fid's active feeding game.
Dan Norton took the goal of making touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost for the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, choked flags and dances.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyous approach.
At last, Mata Vilime had a snoring in Fid's cake that didn't need the peeling.
It was rained, the Fidians hugged, and Britain fell on the grass, totally hit.
Previously, Fidi had hit Japan in semifinal 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both made one goal - the British goalpot was to solve the game.
Kyle Brown took the South African leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling footwork and made a goal under the goal of the second half.
A great late tattoo from Marcus Watson, the 15th-year-long-gby team of England from Anthony's brother, secured victory and finally a hop pool.
The coach's fight against cancer was carried out by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
In these races there will be no more feelings of gold, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard cuts towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning of their golden moments in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they had two wars, there were three votes on the boat, and Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the twins in their second consecutive Olympics in the women's competition - the first women in the British history of sports, who are in such an achievement.
Their leadership was perfect, and this was the undefeated of their 39th appearance, which is record.
This, what we see, two great athletes joining the surface with the bow-to-face closure, is not entirely a picture of the nature of victory.
The background of each row is a group of helpful crafts who gradually contribute to the things that matter, and none of the hands were as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, had no idea if he would live up to this day.
As he said, the situation was spot-on.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky to be able to start his treatment outside the season at the beginning of 2014, when they caused as little interference as possible - if it could ever be used in situations such as this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
That encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department, 20, 30, 50 feet at once when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Warming yourself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after victory, the first couple’s thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little bit more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Afghan command, said: “I have been a tunnel union this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me.
It only highlights how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and Robin too, we have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin. They've been great.
Without Robin we'd be nothing, so he's got great thanks, so he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition for five years.
The couple set up a rough rhythm to which their competitors did not reach.
Even on the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen screamed in the process, stay in the process.
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
Today we were not looking for joys, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and so we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he's getting married to TV showman Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this would be my last competition.
It would've put too much pressure on it.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better, he said.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama’s currents
In October, Iceland organises early parliamentary elections, which are already required by the protestors who have been pissed off by Panama's information years in spring.
The so-called Panama paper revealed the tax evasion of many Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to organise new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much last - day rage affects the election result of the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of the takeovers clearly showed, and the President was elected from outside the political stage by Mr Johannesson.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of the Obama Isis.
The U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isisi and the candidate for democratic Hillary Clinton to be involved in the establishment of an organization.
The Democratic Party pissed off the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
The commander of the army should never let anyone who can fall down that way, Clinton's quote.
In South France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a brandin-utilizer that is popular with Muslims on swimming beaches, says, among other things, British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits, which express great religious ties, can increase the risk of order failures in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to the Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming water in the Oulu area passed through the leg - A bluefin tuna in Pykösärve
The water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only bluefin tuna has been detected on the Pykösjärvi bathing beach.
During Tuesday and the middle week, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the sea coastal bathing waters, concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria in all bathing areas were reduced by the operating limits provided by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococ in the bathing water of Merinieme were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the operating limits.
The bluefin tuna sequestration observed on the bathing shore of the boat does not yet make the water uncomplicated, but in favourable conditions, the situation may change rapidly as a blue whirlwind, making the water surface a blue-green bed on board.
Environmental measures will follow the situation through increased controls.
If the bluefin tuna is turned into a bluefin tuna, this will also be reported in the bathing area notification plan.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
M.K.'s Nasal Disaster: Over 80% of forest owners outside the forest
Metsä gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
It is proposed to reduce the tax on income tax, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for forest conservation has four objectives: promoting generations of forest farms, youthing forest owners' age structure, increasing the size of forest farms and increasing the supply of wood.
The objective of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote generations of forest farms is good, commented Juha Jásrainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the urge to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is presented as a function of the clean capital income of the forest-owner.
It is a return on capital that has been reduced to all other reductions.
The impact of the tax reduction would be greater in the opinion of the R & D authorities if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM proposal leaves us with a reduction in the clean income of the forestry economy to prevent the loss of forest capital income which would be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if no tree was sold.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average hunter can't figure it out.
The model also applies to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to the forest’s profit value is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled from the Walnut's mind too high.
As such, he said, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners were removed from the ceiling.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest stock distribution, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing space.
Forest policy has taken over decades to reduce forest gifts.
It's the result of an ageing forest owners.
According to the RTD, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful rager surprised the drivers with Himanga, two cars were closing in on the stream and ran into each other.
On Friday morning, there was a special chase on the Kala River Himanga.
According to the rescue facility, two cars of a successive period of time fell into the stream, after which the crash came in front of the driver.
According to Harri Pyyhti, after the day-to-day firefighter, the fall of his head is suspected of a powerful shattering.
Back in time there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the car he drove was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himangas to a few kilometers to the Kala River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group indicate that the hardness of cancer tumour increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer medicinal products may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the studies have been published in the published Nature Communications newspaper in the field of cell biology on 4 August.
The Muhto's family home is still in the court, and the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another person.
The cabin of the Muhto family home continues to be in the court with regard to both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June from a family home in Muhoko.
The other eight years received 4 months of killing and gross robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The accused was also sentenced to the risk of serious road safety as a young person and to the transport of vehicles as a young person.
The prosecution, the prosecutors and the man who was sentenced to a more harsh judgment were complaining about the court's judgment.
The D.A. requires a lower sentence on the murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to court law, youngsters 17 years old killed a school home as a director of a child welfare service in July last year.
According to the grounds of the judgment, the 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director sitting on the couch in the living room.
The director had been taken off the line and was able to take a young person into his room, when one youngster hit him with a suture.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental investigation, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the right, young people had planned to escape family homes from at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's most long-lasting spine, increasing only at 156 years of age
The world’s longest living spine has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the study published in Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark, floating around Greenland, or the holocaust, can live up to 400 years old.
The female will only grow when he is 156.
The fact that it grows only one centimetre per year is added to the life of the ice plant.
Only one species of shellfish is known to last longer than live ice sharks.
The researchers found their age on radio skiing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The parent's age was estimated to be 392 years, but the throw in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenue of the State would not be paid if the change in Donald Trump's turnover in corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through tax reliefs that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collection, it would be a really huge sum, $1,000 billion a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction by Trump 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards that have been decided on by the emergency must be renewed and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The Barack Obama health reform must be re-examined.
The management shall be appointed by experts, instead of bureaucrats,
According to Trump, trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be said off.
For imports from China, 45% and 35% would be abused from Mexico.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our witness, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars come on the streets, American planes connect cities, American ships control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though the well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program on Friday, Finland’s time.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is forever mulling, but the actual attack wave will strike in the middle of Madrid - accounting with the past can begin.
That's the point of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travelers (2013) was a small funky and roskin's satiric comedy, prior to the skin where I live (2011) the career of the Spanish tourist.
Julieta 2016 is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a kind of senile love, a relationship and family drama that has a mother-and-a-girl relationship at the center.
The story is simple and we'll see much of it in a long way.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything is at risk of being shattered.
In the aftermath of random encounterings, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a recovery and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her adult daughter.
He begins from time to time before his daughter was born, from the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who is a young teacher of Julieta, will rise from the TV-based series between Ommeltte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a doll, but I would say that time is oddly and literally with a one-time ease.
The Almodóvar movies are often so characteristic of symourism, always with humor, while Julieta is a fair distance.
It is a flat-screened film with good music in place, a very sadly-like movie, which includes ingredients for life.
Instead, the typical visual color thickness for the Spanish director is stored and is being put in a small, quiet eye as a clean piece of action rather than as a working drama.
Diseases, deaths, or just sudden loss of the movie people, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies especially to clothing: in the case of a no-person, you live from the scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point is that of this particular case.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written literature on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro awarded in Nobel 2013.
Novellit has been published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly even written literature filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally inextricably in a more dramatic drama, as much as big things - especially the pale guilt - the thematics of the movie.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8 p.m.
Government is trying to get the election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers will be able to do so that basic Finns will not be totally collapsing.
However, the cut-offs decided in the spring are carried out by a rap shop.
No new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) and Minister of Finance under the budget line of Petter Orpo (kok.).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefit, pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of the unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
The Kunts haunt
Why do ministers so hard to stress that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities are held in April and are the most important heat meter during the election period, not the gallus.
It has been seen before that the natural result of government parties in various directions ruins the government's atmosphere for a long time.
The Gallupits, however, tell us that the basic Finns of the government are expecting a hit, even though the result of the previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent, compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, of which the price of influence in the right administration will be realised for most of them next spring.
The lifeline of the three political parties is about the same as that of the Finnish people.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for it had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's visit to the Parliamentary Group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, trying to soften the expectations of the Finns will not be clouded by new cuts.
Big cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different... if the Sipila government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of taking up debt during this parliamentary term, but the Petter Orpo's draft budget will owe EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the countdowns, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and to admit that the government is not able to comply with its own programme: debt is neither won nor even slow.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means more intense cuts to the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, the election will be taken against what is coming.
The debt ratio of these activities is not good.
It is absolutely clear that the debt of the current activities is not felt, even though Juha Sipila is trying to relieve a positive feeling.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting on the budget are unsatisfied:
The growth forecasts in the world economy have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
After the collapse in 2008, Finland's economy has not just risen, except during the recovery policy that took place temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade, with an average prolonged average of 34 out of 54 weeks.
Unemployment is now costing EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt compensation submitted by the left-wing union was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by new debts.
This is the understanding of the centre, collection and basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are to be left to the municipalities
Three of the four consider that the organization of day care, youth work and exercise of children is responsible for the municipality, reports the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also take responsibility for the individual municipality, including libraries, culture, civil education, building supervision, upper secondary school training, and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is, in turn, the desire for a regional approach, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
There is no need to transfer the roles of municipalities to the State under the order of their respective responsibilities.
A low-aged track drunk ran behind the chase, running away from the police.
The 16-year-old motorcycle drove a police patrol away in Joensuu on Friday night at half a hour.
The police patrol tried to stop without lights on the motorcycle, but the young man left to run the police away from the fair speed.
The back-hole continued on the Sonkjaannantway, from which to the Sorronahotika and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after this, a young man went running away, but a faster police officer ran to catch a fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the rocks fell into its stream.
The truck in the stone pool fell on Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved corner out of the road and fell down its side.
The rescue facility raised the injured driver from the crash from the truck above the remaining door, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first pilots.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
The damaged truck ran into hydraulic oil, which was absorbed by the rescue plant into the well.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtikyla in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimetres long, smart and good-looking woman with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and hints of lost movements are asked to call the Northern Status Centre's tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air... look at the image gallery of Parafest's ruins.
The massive damage caused by the flux flow of paraphest-fessivals.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its economic heart, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Paraphest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on Friday night at the end of the main stage.
On Saturday, the program will continue on presentations held at the City Theatre’s premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program will be organised as planned.
The ignition flow is generated in the lightning cloud when the rainwater and its weight trigger a falling flow of air.
Changes in the form of water in the open cloud bind heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and grows toward the ground.
According to the Finnish Air Science Institute, there is a number of leak flows occurring in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the passing currents.
The fall flow hit the backyard of Joensuu's art museum at Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
There were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the river, who was easily transported to further treatment as a result of injury.
Air pollution by ageing Londoners
According to the study, the skin of London is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of an ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The British survey says Eventing Standard.
The British skin management company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners is two and a half years older than that of an elderly partner living in rural areas.
The old-age small particles of the skin are a very good dust pollution, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Eventing Standard, almost 9 500 Londons die every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for the London people who are walking near the congested streets.
London residents can try to protect against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
The brakes of the tractor betrayed a man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard with tractors.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the brakes of the tractor cheated, and my tractor poured on the man.
The man was not left behind, but my tractor was able to reach a working man enough to be transported to the central hospital seriously injured in further research.
The tractor didn't get any further pain, for it ran into stones in front of it.
Rising with the newest power for the future
The river-based league-Riento, who plays in the Championships, leaves from better starting points than the man remembered in October.
The team's been together for three weeks now.
The joint sound is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the honours of the series have been darker than in Rienno.
Jani Säis, who is continuing as the head coach of the fight, is calling the new team an attempt and unity.
From the foreign triangle, Fred Musoni will begin his second season in Riga.
New faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who was in the Rwandan National Team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is respectively a passer, the brasilian has a size of 198 cents.
Through Josha, Katajan, and Jokipoi, to U.S. country team
Anne JPninen has played in almost all the Salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already six-thousand races going, only 2013 had been missed since Canada had been better in North America's Carnations.
I was at work in Turku and playing with a bunch of women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I got it, and here we are, J.P., 48, says it.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 JPYPnen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that wasn't played at SM just like salibandy.
They were playing chess at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj hockey in the SM series, Jyphen remembers.
The partnership played with the University in the Salibandy SM series of the period 1991-92, the following three were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the company to the A-girls championship.
Women's SM series peaked on silver in 1995.

Beach Volley Master Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to stop playing as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary period.
The Beach old Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airporters and the Finnish Aviation Union, the SM-final tournament will be awarded six best pairs of each series of beaching.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY's raised Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley flags for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, looks forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as you can get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, the Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola sedu set fire to Hasu's spark and gave good luck to a fine hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started a flight ball at the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main thing is too big to play shirts, the knee shields in the ankles, and the great anesthetics and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
At a small location, the sports club was a busy community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved in the operation, and the father of the teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural selection of species during the junior period to the counterweight of the indoor balloon.
The song has been played on the riverside since the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also followed the SM tour of the Juniors, thinking that I would be there some day.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays this weekend with Annina Parkkinen in the SM-finals.
Riikka Lotonen and Tarru Lahti after the tournament in the second punished twin goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold from the reward cabinet, Hasu throws valuables.

At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited for civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, Hasu plans to put the toes in the nail.

Solomon Koli went bravely as a farmer
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk benefits, sweats and perseverance.
A young farmer, Koli of Solomon, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Some two years ago, Koli and her little brother Valtter Kol started working as an extension of their home space.
Their father Mark Koli helps and advise brothers with his own experience.
The start-up of a rural enterprise meant debt and increase in order to allow bread to come from agriculture in the hand.
This has been my case since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a vacuum drain, and first of all, the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells me and more that it would not have taken place if he did not have faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli, who is raising meat cars, is to invest even more in his navet.
The work has produced results, for Solomon Koli has been elected to the top ten best groups of the future of the Earth’s Future magazine in the competition of a young cooking producer.
At best, he competes with the possibility of winning.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria shall notify inflation for the first time for eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (December 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (December 2014 - July 2015).
July 2016's cost index was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 as compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, economics and routine care (0.5 %), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and training.
The active substance in Snapchatin is evaluated as Asian caramel
According to Snapchat, anime has worked as an inspiration source for the filter, but according to some observers it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to play in ways that are almost ridiculous with the design and identity of reality.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, a dog or a character that would fit in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Birds are simple face-to-face tools that produce more than 30 million improved browsers a day.
All delusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat has previously been criticised by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or black mask or prefers bleached skin color as beauty extract.
So when Snapchat advertised the lens for some users this week, which gave them a hint of eyes, a sharp teeth and a round of cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people, a yellowface.
And they're wondering if these repeated mothers could be a sign of a greater company problem regarding diversity.
News and evil spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had ceased to be a feature.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant to be a tribute to anime figure, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student, who was widely distributed from the pictures, said in her e-mail that the lens was at least offensive and uncomfortable.
He added that it was very difficult to argue against a comparison with the opposite gross Asian carcase and filter strengths.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow one, but a yellow one, being taken to extreme disorientation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s enormous, racially diverse youth audience may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding of the attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in the interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an insult to the user, it would be much more difficult for these types to be unnoticed.
On Thursday Zhu, the product manager and engineer working for the Medium, decided to remove Snapchat's account and urged others to do the same.
In his letter to Medium and in his phone interview, he said that he believed that the disputes related to the race reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat’s remuneration practices.
Zhu criticised the company mainly for the white male leadership and decided to write on the hashtag #DeletSnapchat (#PudaSnapchat)
“If they do not have a wide range of skin colors in their staff, therefore they can make decisions like this, Zhu, the Chinese American, said, “or have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could be spoken directly.
Other observers share his opinion, the complaint in which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, indicating its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the rotation of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired some time ago a recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and to take forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for his own part, said that he would keep Snapchat's account closed by adding: \"Is it possible that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not a good thing?
According to the Congress panel, military officials have distorted Isis intelligence data
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the authorities of the U.S. military headquarters had modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of war against the peoples in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground justified.
In the Interim Report of the Task Force set up by the Committee on Defence Forces of the Parliamentary House, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Defence Regulations, ‘the widespread dissatisfaction was observed among the main intelligence analysts who said that the superiors were cheating on the American efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters known as Centcomina is the headquarters of the armed forces in the Tampa of Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outputs that were accepted by the Supreme Leaders of Centcom typically gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorist efforts than the facts on the ground justified; they were usually more positive than the analyses produced by other experts in the intelligence community, the press release of the report said.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-value decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, California Republican.
The failure of Centcom's management will go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the subsidized problems in the descriptions and analyses of the capital, from the US’s efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrative authorities of the Obama regime had ordered reports to be thumbed, it describes the analysts who felt that Centcom's leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat in a more positive light of Islamic state, Isisi.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates from the main country to Congress were significantly more positive than what was happening in the first half of 2015,” the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack on Mosul’s return could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis.
“After months of examination, this is very clear,” said the opinion, Mr Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-value intelligence leaders at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the outputs of major intelligence in order to reduce Isisi's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that the analysts had raised concerns that intelligence was being manipulated by the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday monitors more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
An extra, ongoing investigation of Centcom's intelligence has begun by the Department of Defence.
On Thursday, democratic members of the House's intelligence committee published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican working groups.
“In 2014-2015, Centcom created an intelligence evaluation of Isis and Iraq’s security forces by Adam B. Schiff, a leader of the Committee, said in the opinion.
According to Mr Schiff, this process was \"pronged by the publication of intelligence,\" which made the mood worse among analysts and did not give enough room for different perspectives.
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to settle their conclusions on a pre-defined or political basis.
The Daily Beat will report on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August The New York Times reported that the Pentagon inspector has started an investigation after the appeals of Centcom analysts.
Commissioner Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on Congress's report for as long as the inspector's investigation is under way.
But he said that \"experts differ from interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome the sound dialogue on these essential issues of national security.
The investigation has other follow-up consequences than just what comes to the question of whether the bombing measures taken by the United States in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama could rely on an honest estimate of the military operations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of the Islamic state intelligence reflects over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a study article saying that despite the opposition of several analysts, the President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and used very little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hoker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strike against the Islamic state's dominant refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary processing facilities to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Commander of Centcom's bridge, General Lloyd J. Austin III, started to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as a more positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and his place in the headquarters became General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win for the fourth time in a row at the women's country hockey, organising a mid-term review with Britain
The day after he had made three goals for the team in winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made on Thursday the United States Women's Land Hockey Team in two first goal of winning Americans in India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound unforgettable, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
- I have no idea, he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who's keeping a book of his paintings.
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament, and they share their group first with Britain, which was still invincible when it was won on Thursday, Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived a quarter, and this game will determine who will be the first and second of all in their six teams.
The first position is to avoid the strong Dutch, the second group leader, at the beginning of a slightly longer quarterly.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, Americans have raised their surprise success here, four years after they stayed in London's Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvanian Blue Bell and picked up his mahockeymails for the first time when he was 3 years old (the parents played the species in Drexel) when he joined the country team at 16 when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
\"Culture change, mental change, physical change,\" Bam said.
We didn't have the same job in London as we have now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the goal of the festival near the goal.
India had come into play with no profits in the tournament, but the team was surprised to hold the 1-0 reading until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time from the left of the field, then rolled it in the middle and pulled it into the goal of the ball, taking the Americans to 2-0 wire.
Melissa Gonzalez added four times in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first American goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had released one goal from every first three win.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
\"We have a good situation now,\" Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of Trampolin among the Olympic Games
Whatever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on their way.
Rio de Janeiro events seem to be continuing and inevitable, from a message of fierce competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympics themselves were a flaming message capsule, which is transmitted from the archbishop to the swimmer and from the gymnastics to the triathlonist.
It's impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of a neighbor on a coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympics, and the future heart-breaker with a smile, could well be one of all known names that are presented at the best viewing time, supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, from California Lake Forest, 28, competes in trampoliin from the Olympic Games.
Olympialiec doesn't illuminate all species as much.
Far from the center, in part in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistolammunk, bows, ball of feathers, taekwondo.
We always have breast-feeding. Long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the reduced attraction of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first performance in Sydney, its presence in the meantime has been so little that many of them I interviewed did not realize at all that it was the Olympic species.
This can be regional inability.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not moved to the final before 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna are defending London's gold medal.
Trampoline, however, is associated with a certain attraction, partly because of the uncivilised replacement it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just an inoperable fan.
The species have opportunities for amusing, as is seen from the color of the endless bombs of the cartoons, but it also has gymnastics and swimming baths, two species which, in principle, join together.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a box of ponchos.
The master's pursuers jump on giant tramples up to nearly 30 feet, and they must carry out routing business series (seconds, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and pilot time.
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympics are straight ahead.
Mital hopeers must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes round the field.
They are not just hunting the goal line or the start-up window, but also, in the television band news, another loose border: the world or the Olympics display.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and it can even get the viewer to tears.
But that is also the reason why watching races can be a little tiring.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
Trampolin's up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, affecting the gravity of the astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly again up.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no raging rush towards the end, no jumps to distance, only a dream of time and gravity, a melting interruption.
It's as close as the Zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's Karsin competitions and then finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 13 p.m. (ET), men's races will also be held on Saturday 13 p.m.
NBC will send finals as part of the afternoon's software starting at 14 a.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic bomb, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which, most likely, does not notice in the common chaos.
And if knowledge is achieved only by offering male athletes to look and perform (as the U.S. male powers recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new fan.
\"The generation shows its mind – Ethiopia, a long-term ally in the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has been faced by the violent opposition of the government.
There have been dozens of protesters being shot to death in the meetings with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade it has been one of the most stable African states, a strong ally in the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have plagued the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people were rushing into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's answer was pathetic.
They said the police shot and killed dozens of non-armed protestors.
The spreads, recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be the end of last year or beginning this year, seem to be how security authorities hit young people while they were forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the African horn in the International Crisis Group study group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most violent country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threat of the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much assistance from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new labor train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have kept talking about the repression of the government, the opposition in the country has been restricted and the dissidents have been silenced effectively.
Many have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
“If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to show their mind, this will happen, Seyoum Teshome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia,” said.
The whole youth shows his mind.
One generation shows its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything about land use for the curvature of the power of the coalition.
After a much criticised election, the governing party with its allies received the last opposition position, and now it has all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea grow; the battle along this bitter and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been more or less flourished over recent years, may try to use the waste and rearm.
A number of factors explain why, after years of collapse, bitter emotions are about to explode.
The first affects seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only over the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as the cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and Internet service improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through the remote network servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups, oroms and amphas, are better off with each other.
Oromones and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business using the Oroms, many of which are Muslims and are living on the ground.
But this is changing, too.
“We’re on our way to the organization under one umbrella,” said Oromo President Muatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many amharas and orphans think that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by its tiger people, which is about six per cent of the population and is governed by armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for restlessness is Meles Zenawin's loss.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw her around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make the opponents harmless.
“The government does not have a basic problem like that,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haimariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill the Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethical Tiger, Haimaram is from the south.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
For the previous time, Ethiopia was in such a crash in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed that the government first hutilized and then robbed them.
In the follow-up attack, many protesters died, although less than in the last few months, and the period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia's view of infrastructure planning, such as the new business train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
Clearly, though, this has not stopped the country's internal authority from gaining contempt for the government of Ethiopia.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
In the last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amphara, attacked the companies owned by tigers, and the hatred against tigre becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations place the United States and other Western allies in the position of clumsy.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for air-circuit flights to Somalia, even though it said some time ago that it had closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to see their unstable allies collapse.
\"This, Abdi said, \"a real balance...
Donald Trump explains Obama-based-Isisi's claims to be \"sarkasm\"...
Donald J. Trump tried to repress his latest campaign on Friday, claiming that he was not seriously, when this week he told numerous stories that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also set up his defenders, who have stressed in order to defend him during a stormy period, to a difficult position where they need to explain the comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After the announcement at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump claimed the same more and more excitingly in Thursday's interviews, where he urged that he was really meant to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
In an early Friday morning on Twitter, though, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation from the previous day when Trump said that he had been seriously accused in several interviews.
When the conservative radio stationer Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpi make his point by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this hearing into his ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the opinion polls that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought when they talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to the subject.
Again on Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump's been using sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after she faced a broad criticism, apparently when proposing that Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, she later explained her comments by saying that I am sarcastic.
This approach will allow Trump to speak at the borders and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then “to explain” direction or, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is attractive to his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter through many different lenses.
Instead of mitigating their speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more soapier in the last few days when his popularity has continued to decline.
A new, Friday NBC/Wall Street Journal/Maris-kyseyly survey showed that Trump is going to take up Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump, as a general rule, seeks to avoid being accused of saying things that provoke him, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faced an ever closer review of the presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position where they need to publicly support him, regardless of how provocating his comments are.
The former mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giulian, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, saw a lot of trouble defending the candidate for CNN's interview on Thursday.
“I believe that there are real, political comments in his words,” said Giulian, when he was asked about the reality of Trump’s claim by Obama and Clinton to set up a Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, totally wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans of the power stream try to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Daddy to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter for an attack on the news media, hunting for his every word and being neutral against him.
He mocked people, pathetic, television experts who were trying to find out about him, saying, \"They're not going to succeed. \"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new piece of evidence that he was inconvenient as president.
Previously on \"Coffee\"...
Verb Cafe was a busy, only cash-approved place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue’s streets cost it too much.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
It was the last loss that the locals had in the middle-class town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is depressed, and Verb is now soap shop –
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
Last November, Dr. Verb opened up at Greenpoint, below the head of the mile from his original location.
The new Verbis has a wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff still have the same and there is the same unsuspected atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of a new place.
He started at the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things back.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought the same espress machine.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try, too.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu, you can find bacon egg cheese sandwiches, and you can get, for example, capers and rusted onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
No more beer is served in coffee, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed the old clients of the same power.
“Williamsburg too much for many former customers, ” he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verbb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says that when Verbin shut down, he gave up the coffee drink for a while.
“I realized I enjoyed the coffee and culture of the Verb, ” he said.
Now he's back to the coffee bar, although that day he ordered a chai drink, which is one of the new additions, instead of his ordinary ice coffee.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, was faithfully visiting the Verbis since 2003.
He used to work there, and he always made the same order.
“ Each day, fifteen more than seven, regularly as the bell, I went in and they were preparing spices for my bagelian butter, ” he said.
Photograph, Rodriguez said he wanted to try and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes due to a variation, he has room for spiced bagel bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not wearing a grudge for the soap store that took over the old facilities.
In fact, Soap Cherien’s owners offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient for cold coffee at the cafe.
I think we can still take the offer, Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu half, and Rodriguez said that he planned to put it up soon to something to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
New location has other advantages.
A local juice place wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the next building.
For many customers, they get their old favorites in the new Verbis.
Joseph Whitt was a client of his claim and said he was unsatisfied when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
I missed it. He said I wanted to smell it.
A Square Meal: flattened food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
President roosevelt liked the fine-looking Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the Hanhemaksier, and Maryland's soup-sucking dress.
On that day his diet was less modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato salt and dessert from the bone marrow.
“It was a sign of cultural solidarity for people who suffer, ” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her mate, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat.
The Brooklyn Heights couple is food historyists.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of their own culinary solidarity, they will meet the supplier at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unprepared lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been operational since the 1929 Stock Exchange.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive butter, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato salt and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered the meat murky, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the flat season.
“Murrems were very popular, ” said Ziegelman.
There was a peanut murky, a liver-murdered, butt-murdered.
They were made from a manufacturing material and some of the low-end ingredients that continued the actual production material.
Imagine your cancer as much peanuts as they make up your dinner.
Coe off.
I'm sure it must have felt in the stomach from the lyijynraska. He said.
In the years before the recession on the American tables, especially in the countryside, there was like a table for the eat-nit-paul-jaksat-outola.
Women's groups made food for male farmers, and fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chrome the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of grandeur.
\"The food came from the fire to a central, pampering topic for the Americans,\" Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same uplifting was a new, affordable diet: Mysterian dishes, such as worrys and boxes, became the main food, and the box was “a powerful way to use food stars, ” said Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat that had been at the centre of American meals for years became a sustainablely administered luxury product.
Special compositions were tried in terms of calorie volume and nutrient content more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman also prepared a period of food for a book containing recipes, where the roasted onions were filled with peanuts.
It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table, Coe said.
Ziegelman stated: “It was unreal.
The peanut butter is no match for baked onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Households Office in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
They encouraged women to start as budgetmakers, and to respond to the challenge of turning non-exhaustive spags and carrots into tasty doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic taste.
Specially delicious are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake weapons.
At the same time as he publicly praised his childhood simple, iowan earthly food, he meals like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
Coe said, \"He likes continental food, like fish with a throat sauce.\"
He ate a tuxedo in his dining room on his head.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had you encouraged him to be an example of his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in a taste, the White House became a place that didn't offer only those of Washington's miners, but also food made more than anything.
Many of the flat-rate eating methods were abandoned as soon as the land returned to its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calorie and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they achieved a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating practices, such as how he could not throw away food.
\"He was really afraid to waste food,\" Coe said.
Ziegelman recalls: “He even sickened people.
There was a windshield incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the bone marks that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called a brow,” said Ziegelman, adding that the general trick was to give a name to modest recipes.
There was no creaming juice in the aftermath, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and canoe.
Everyone drowned their spoons unwittingly in their tamble, brown leader.
I'm surprised it wasn't bad.
Coe played once and for another.
Speaking of a positive budgeter, he told his wife: \"A lot of mocked German nuts could help...
Gilead will be replaced by a lawyer's expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S. Chamber of Appeal has stated that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the costs incurred by the lawyer against Merck & Co Inc in the case of hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars after they broke two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success medications in Sovald and Harton. This release followed when the American judge found Merck’s abuses, which included false oath and other ethical practices.
In a judgment lodged on Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman of the United States said that Gilead is entitled to leave the compensation that it brought against the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can significantly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other's law on the ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of the active substance sofosbuvir.
US support forces say that they've taken over Manbij, the manbij that Isis ruled.
The troops supported by the United States have taken full advantage of the northern town of Manbij, located near the border of Turkey, after the last Isis fighters left town, the group spoke Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were considered captive by the fighters from the Sharfa Darwish SGF, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
\"The city is now fully under our control, but we've started to investigate it,\" he told Reuters.
Clintons made $1075 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax declaration, which showed that the income of the democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $1075 million, and that their real Federal tax percentage was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million of talk benefits, and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his library, which told him about his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, published ten years' tax returns with his wife Anne Holton.
Their real Federal tax percentage in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set a standard for the economic transparency of the yard,” said Jennifer Palmier, the campaign assistant for Clinton.
As a serious contrast to this Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and cancels his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
As a rule, US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose any obligation on them.
The New York businessman Trump's lawyers have appealed to the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
\"Your turn,\" Ian Sams, campaign assistant Clinton, said on Twitter, publishing a link to the tax returns of the democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit was completed.
The Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his transactions and numerous other links, such as Russia.
Clinton is infected with the problem on Friday, the online video that brought up visible Republicans calling for Trump to publish his tax.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the past decades has done: he published his tax return, he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business column borrowed a number of taxpayers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same on Friday.
The Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named Warren Buffett, which would ensure that over $1 million per year, at least 30% of taxes are paid.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska last week, Buffett, which is located in Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has a tax administration inspection, and that Trump did not fear a tax collection agency, but a voter.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax percentage was about 40.5%.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of $100,000.

Chili powder condoms and thinners enhance the protection of Tanzania’s elephants
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from walking into human jurisdictions - they throw animals with chill powder-filled condoms.
The Chinese has proved to be effective, and several years ago, the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation together with the American Nature Conservancy has improved its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use the nonviolence four steps to protect homes and hundreds without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the World Noor Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
Since we developed tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them.
The first two steps are held with the flashlight and the ringing of the horn to indicate the intrude elephant.
If it does not prevent an animal, the so-called \"chilipilvi\" will be thrown.
The condom shall be filled with chill powder and earth mixture as well as with condiment, and then the condom shall be crammed in such a way that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it breaks down and bites the Chili powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way is the trigger that shoots the Roman candle in the air, and the fire will produce a loud, bright explosion.
RTNews: The Jewish filmmaker criticises the Berlin hotel, which removed the Israeli reference number at the request of the Arabs
The French, Jewish filmmaker saved the media storm when he revealed that the Kampinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli reference number. According to the employer, this is due to the Arabic requests.
Claude Lanzmann, who wrote a Shoah documentary about Holokaust, was frustrated by the British Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann sought to find Israel's hotel in the country's reference number list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016, in Berlin, in the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and caught?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone station.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took the matter up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer received from it was a sign of him.
The hotel's recipe said that it was the decision to consider the management of the Kempinski Hotel.
The reason behind the decision was even more stunned by the filmmaker.
“The majority of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s reference number, ” says Lanzmann.
The German ambassador, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case “a great injustice, ” reports Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It's already a great injustice in itself.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't have to be explained.
We're waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions. The official said.
The incident produced a rather counter-reaction online when people called it scandalous.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply “truth up to the claims of the Arabs.
“While, ” said the second publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called the incident “unpredicted ” and “forgave Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“The order to not include Israel in the short-term selection list has never been made, ” says the representative of the Kempinsk, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the reference number has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubbers against Brazilian students.
On Thursday, students and police gathered together in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo, when students met to show their views against government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubbers against protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to break down the student force, which led to the police using rubber and tear gas.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their horror plans.
According to the proposals of Governor Paulo Gerald Alckmin, the state of Sao Paolo, a few less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of those involved in the demonstration were seen writing on the walls against temporary President Michel Temer.
This last demonstration took place only days after the protestors went out as a single force to support President Dilma Roussef, arrested in the country's Senate when voting for his official charge.
RT trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly rising by 71%
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% from the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Following the withdrawal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a large degree of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing link to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“In theory, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is trade expansion,” said Dzhagaryan.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to USD 856 million during the same period in 2015.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of USD 697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran rose by 16% to 158 million dollars.
\"The growth of the coffee was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons,\" said the Ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record this year of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran granted some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
“It is safe to say that last year’s record of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken, ” he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved memories of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner hit the goal when the British hit the bike gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner was honored by the men's team prince at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's three defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of Sir Chris Roy, where his scotch triangle was restored, the legend was proud of his youthful pride when he got to the finish of his victory on the team of New Zealand.
Britain took a shock profit four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth six Olympics.
And they repeated the pace in the World Championships of March 6 when they set it modestly in London, even though Hoy has then decided to race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time for the Hindes to appear.
Hoy's termination also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which British trainers held the potential in the scotch that has now been recognized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made the Olympics show in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British Triangle won the duel for gold.
After his own tour, he was right behind him, but Kenny stabbed the team in charge, and Skinner held it.
The strategy change was a major part of the change in shape, and it included the Hindes drive with a major shift to slow down and allow Kenny, and in particular Skinner, to hold on to the paces.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize school.
23-year-old Glasgowian Skinner said: “Vertalism is impervious.
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
In the final, we made an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning London 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment, and the British racing partners had not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with excessive profit.
He said: “It felt like he was in London when there were so many British flags on his feet.
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, who won seven out of ten cycling types in both Beijing and London.
If this describes the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
On the basis of the condition shown by Kenny, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's looting, winning three Olympics in one of the Olympics.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (now apparently on the holy day of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would rise to six gold and one silver.
It's the same as Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just liked this one.
The team competition is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To win alone is to be honest with you, it's lonely.
He said: “If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the ritual.
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in time for four people, four kilometers in the team run.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the world record that won gold in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges last night before the time when officials called him into the length measurement.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milgavavi Katie Archibald went forward at the world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole set of medals.
After truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, the expectations have been reduced before Rio's races.
The background has been drama, the least of which have not been the end of the competition between the technical director Shane Sutton, in April due to sex and temptation, as well as the end of the race for large persons, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night competitions on cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Great Britain now rises to its peak at its perfect moment could be held once again.
The future of Portland’s meltdown is questionable due to the cutting of the electricity contract
The future is uncertain when an electric company selling electricity to the factory reveals that one of the owners of the factory is about to conclude a distribution agreement, so it is expected that the operation of all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria Administration that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not continue.
The aid period for 20 years expires in November.
Even 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, due to the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect can be possible, as the meltdown uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoan Portland will lose money and will be in danger of closure.
The measure is now following a number of years of speculation on the future of the plant, which began with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy on the power plant of Loy Yang An located in Latrobe Valley, said that it would also expect the other three owners to conclude their contract.
The majority of the factories are owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller parts.
“AGL expects the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity demand of the melt will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called \"protection agreements\", which had to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have 12 months' notice, so they will actually end in 2017.
‘For this reason, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017’, the electric company said.
All possible performance effects for AGL from the year 2018 to the year 2018 are currently limited by strong prospects for the future electricity wholesale market.
The AGL said that it had already decided to go ahead, reducing the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate agreements does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep melting on operation or to ensure smooth access to electricity.
The US company said that it entered into a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
Analysts have been equipped with both the Portland merger in Victoria, and also due to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, the CEO of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, said to analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
‘If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for [electricity] markets.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just Kardashian's true-tv star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manage Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the deck of the U.S. Vogue's requested September number.
Kendall, a brand ambassador to Este Lauder and modelled in the fashions of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday with his Instagram account.
\"The watching of this deck in a room full of rich people made me cry, \"Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jennerin clan (excluding the problem with Rob and Caitlyn, and with all the favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but who ended up in the classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
This is almost every child's television series – the birthplace of the day – a cliché pattern (Secrest says the words, I suppose, that we would forget about you – with the credibility of the morning framed suit), but Krissi had to get his other girls to some extent benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's great-grandfather Kim may have reached Vogue's claim first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is exactly his own class.
The September number of Vogue is the highest selling weight throughout the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee table book than a fashion paper, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832 page teaching last year was advertising content).
The discovery of the newspaper is so much expected that for the last two years, the images of the magazine have been leaked before official publication.
Previous women on deck have been, among other things, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, indeed, there have been more publicists working in models than models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, the magazine described as a model for his generation, would hit his first category, he'd be in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
The last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career, as a result of Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
His true-tv history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be dark.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and this colleague, Gigi Hadidi, calling them \"this moment's bitch\"
This feeling rose again with the Jenner Vogue deck.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the deck of Vogue's September number.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Este Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he took to the LIVE magazine.
And in his spare time, perhaps only to see his sister Kourtney and his children, he's a real TV star.
The Community's judicial centres will turn out 160 000 people each year
The most vulnerable people of more than 160 000 will be turned away from the legal centres of the Community every year when the sector prepares for the impact of additional financial cuts on its operations at extreme levels.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight unfair evictions and similar - are already being turned away in search of legal advice and representation.
Legal services already restricted to extremes in the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are to lose 30% of their federal funding.
According to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually by the President of the Community.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s judicial centres are chronically under-represented, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year,” he said.
People who leave violent relations with uncontrollable and depressing debts, families in housing, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The Federal Government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of homeless people in Queensland are forced to navigation in the midst of complex legal problems without any help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brand to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the government of the state implemented its promise to increase the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to examine the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palasczuki should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged after an employee was claimed to be armed with a threat.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged to court that they did nothing after they were told that the campaign’s head of activity in North Carolina threatened with a gun worker in February when they drove in Jeep.
The incident was described as former software operator Vincent Bordin of the state campaign on the complaint in Charlotte on Wednesday to the State Court of Justice.
My Lord said that for months, he waited for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that this would not happen.
Chief Earl Phillip put the gun out, put his right front finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee-scraper.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, the complaint was made.
\"You don't have to fire things to cause damage,\" said Bordini in the complaint.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate was upset when he told the public that \"the other addition of people, who are generally considered as weapons owners and armedmen, could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and should be elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of the context, and that he does not support violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for reckless control, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional distress.
Mr Hope Hicks, represented by Trump, did not respond immediately to the request.
The attempts to reach Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, the local news star company in Charlote reported Phillip's recent campaign.
The call request submitted by Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered to his consultant.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is against the Bordin Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings a recovery and a fallout of the entire stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the London 2012 races when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics had enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
10 000 new places of training and 40 000 new jobs will be created only for local communities and youth unemployment will be removed from the airport.
As before London’s 2012 races, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for competition and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles must always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billions of economic growth, as well as to leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
In Heathrow, we have a great team, which has implemented 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment, while remaining in the budget: T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world in five consecutive years, to T2, which was built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to take the third runway, supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create the legacy of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of Heathrow Board and former secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse games to prevent advertising
For companies who receive money from online advertising, companies pass through advertising barriers are a cat and mouse play, said one of the companies that produce such a programme.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blogbook saying that users can update the program filters to prevent advertising on social networks again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website is exchanged around advertising, so that advertising inhibitors would be more difficult to detect which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's been orbiting the new code.
Ben Williams, the Adblock representative, in the blog version, wrote that \"a reasonable, fair fight between the open source code advertising community and its orbiters has been underway since the idea of preventing advertising was discovered, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the extent to which advertising inhibitors have become industry.
Globally around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in the last year's Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost fourfold the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the advertising inhibitors of the pages used on the computer, since mobile advertising inhibitors do not work on the social network or Instagram in Facebook’s mobile applications, the representative said.
Computers still generate enough revenue to allow Facebook to consider investment worth this kind of activity.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it was its daily-human preferences tool to give people more power as to how advertising is directed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying, as they would also prevent some of the content of the website other than advertising.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” said the Facebook representative in the e-mail report.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She got hit by a car on a Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim lay on a highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman left on a motorway under several means of transport as early feelings of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday, near Morges'ta Vaud's canyon.
A woman made an impenetrable act and stood in the dark to lie on the road where she was hit by several means of transport, the Vatadin police said in the opinion.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, told by the police who appeals to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
The crime investigation has begun, which is a logical step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hoffstetteter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, let us see if any of the drivers involved are charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It'll be decided by the D.A., Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In either case, the person who walked on a dark motorway was estimated to be unable to expect drivers to meet a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released from charges of indemnification after he hit and killed a man lying on A! Road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, told the court.
The Court noted that the police, who was responding to an emergency call, were in a reasonable way, and that the man’s presence on the road was an exceptional and unforeseeable situation, the judge said.
Anyone with information on the Thursday case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had to live once
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to be resident once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus’s past by using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus would have had hot, waterless surfaces and that CO2 filled with air developed could sometimes have been underground conditions.
Scientists have previously presented that Venus’ slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have been thin, earthly atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model was also examined by early Venus’s surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical variation to enable life and rapid protection from the degradation of water.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 per cent of the diarrhea sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its sun to the sun for almost two months at a time,” explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer, which works like a umbrella covering the surface of the shields in large parts of the sun heat.
In fact, the result of average climate temperatures is a few degrees below the current Earth temperature.
The model produced Venus’s developmental story, which is similar to what the planet scientists had previously assumed.
Even though Venus was likely to have to be living, it was exposed to excessive heat and UV light over several billions of years.
Its oceans faded and its water vapours burned in the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gases, Venus, which we now know, was left behind.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Gephysical Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy is giving up Avalanchen coach's nest
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of the Vice-President of Colorado Avalanchen and Vice-President of the hockey affairs, i.e. the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have made my duty as Vice-President of Colorado Avalanchen's hockey affairs and as the head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination, ” said 50-year-old Roy in the opinion.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the Coach and Vice-President of the hockey affairs must be fully in line with the organisation’s view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for this contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me of his decision today,\" said Sakic.
We appreciate everything that he has done for the organisation, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed to the best coach of the league as the first winner of the Jack Adams Award during his 2013-14 Avalanchen season.
He led the team to 112 points and a central division victory, but Minnesota poured the Colorado drop-offs in the first round, and the team hasn't made it in the last two years.
The Avalanchen games in the season 2015-16 ended with 39 winnings, 39 loss and 4 match games, and the team lost five points to Wild by losing a wild card slot at the Western Conference.

The oil workers of the North Sea continue to negotiate and delay the strike
The North Sea oil workers' working battles due to wages will be postponed when all sides of the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
There have been random arrangements against Wood Group's oilfield service company in the North Sea drilling cars led by Royal Dutch Shell.
\"Wood Group, both Unite and RMT associations, can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch a process aimed at solving the current dispute,\" read in the joint opinion.
During the next few weeks, we will hold a number of full-day meetings from the earliest next week, so that we can take on to the problems of a fresh inventory.
According to the trade unions, their recent effort to fight for more than 25 years was a opposition to possible, up to 30%, cuts in wages.
In this year, Wood Group cut the salaries of North Sea contractors by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The company's remuneration reduction follows the 10% reduction of contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary space to find out about the fall in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from their pay lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, while the company will reduce its operations as a result of its major merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbating the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member, met with allies earlier this week to discuss one of the major North Sea working groups.
He said the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just for the few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country, ” he said.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the last five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pikadie Star Force
The last task of the Kepler Scoop has helped the astronomers to collect the most complete list of the speeds of spins of the stars of the Pikad's star group.
The new information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the stars run at variable speeds, as well as how circular times relate to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age, and even the history of the solar system, Caltech’s infrared processing and analysis of the Pasadena Centre, Luisa Rebull, said in the press release.
The Pikadie Star Force is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching an adult.
They're running at their top level now.
At its peak spin speed, these adult stars eat large amounts of stars.
When these winds pass through the stars' magnetic fields, they hold the stars.
When the star gets old, its speed of rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler will measure the speed of rotation for each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable high spots, such as sun clouds.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that the larger stars run slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, where the bigger make pies slower than the smaller ones.
“We see that skid wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Since the Pikadie Star Force is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the attributes of the stars at spin speeds.
“Plaidi’s star team offers an anchor to the theoretical models of the stars, which understand both the kisses, the younger and the parents,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, and why the stars slow their speed and so-called hang their 'tances' in the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speeds of spins of the Pikadie in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
