Four members of the Kemerovo Group were held in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police captured Slava Gulevich, the so-called leader of the Kemerovo group operating in Spain, known as Slava Kemerovski, who is known as Slava Kemerovski in the crime scene.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday the Court also arrested three suspected prisoners in Estonia.
It is suspected that Kemerovo's criminal community is a 27-57-year-old person who is mainly involved in drug offences.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was held in Mija.
Three men were considered suspected in Estonia, one of them was collected according to the data to be the head of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the crime problem in the Community was clearly divided into tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal income, commented on the head of the pre-trial criminal proceedings, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
“We do not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case, ” added the prosecutor.
It is a matter of people who have previously been involved in law enforcement, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become normal for us, and this week’s operation shows the success of cooperation, ” commented prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Centre's Police Department, said that there was a pre-trial trial in advance of detention for nearly a year and a half.
“In the first half of the week, long-term work was realized and, at the same time, in Estonia and Spain, we held suspicions of crimes, ” he said.
He added that the Central Criminal Police officials were helpful in detention in Spain.
For years now, we have a good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian police.
These detentions are another message for criminals that we can get them out of the other end of Europe, ” said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, when he was in liberty, the men who had been suspected may continue to commit new crimes and therefore sought their arrest and the court accepted it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial criminal proceedings shall be carried out by the Central Criminal Police Agency and the State Prosecutor.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevich in blackmail and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered to be another man in the world’s second priority after the traditional underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovos, rose underground in Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmails in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
The international joint operations, the confiscation of criminal income and the judgments which have entered into force confirm that the fight in the field of organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused of criminal offences committed by the so-called Dikayev criminal Community, of which a criminal income of EUR 80 000 was seized, or of nine persons in the case of Igor Aleynikov, in 2006, created a criminal community aimed at the illicit trafficking of smugglers and crimes related to trafficking in human beings in East Virginia and South Estonia.
There is around EUR 71 500 in the context of the consolidated criminal income.
In these criminal matters, the fact that policemen exchange information and evidence with foreign colleges every day and, if necessary, carry out operations in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns about travelling to Mission
The National Association for the Advanced People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Mission against the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.
The Group’s statement states: “The NACP travel note issued for the State of Massour, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missourirs to be particularly careful and extremely careful when moving around the state, taking into account the suspicious events of the entire race, which have recently taken place in the state and have been brought out here.
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning as recently as possible Missour's law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and the fact that the targets of the state's regularists are unevenly limited to minorities.
\"The rights of citizens of men are being violated.
They pull the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, ” said the President of NACP Mission, Rod Chapel, The Kansas City Star.
“We have never received so much complaints before, ”
This is the first warning issued by the organisation for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults in the direction of black students at the University of Mission and the death of 28-year-old black-haired Tory Sanders from Tennesse.
Sanders died in the suspicious circumstances of the beginning of this year after he got out of the state when he drove through the gas station and the police of Mission took him under arrest without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to the recent report drawn up by the Public Prosecutor of Mission, which shows that the cars of black car drivers are stopped by 75% more likely than those of the whites.
“The wisdom is intended for people to be conscious and to warn their families, friends and colleagues for what might happen in Missour, ” Chapel said.
\"The people must be ready, whether it means involving bail money or informing relatives that they are passing through the states,
On the basis of the latest data on the F.B.I.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.D.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.S.D.S.S.S.S.D.S.S.D.D.S.S.D.S.S.D.S.S.S.D.D.S.S.D.S.D.S.D.S
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missour Act, which makes it difficult for the company to sue in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The United States of America's Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after those states adopted immigration laws, which required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiles.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives out travel warnings for other countries, but recent stakeholders have begun to use this measure as a countermeasure to certain US law and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about different forms of this severe illness?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, there is a low risk of chronic hepatitis B and C, which may further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver cortex and liver cancer.
The Health Service’s epidemiology advisor Kutsar tells us that the signs of acute hepatitis are similar for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of the skin and muscles.
The last sign of disease also comes from the popular name of liver inflammation, yellow disease.
In children, hepatitis may occur without symptoms.
Different types of liver inflammation can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and pass for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her disease that affects the liver.
Kutsar hears different forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
The hepatitis viruses spread from the sick person and infect us in the eating or drinking of contaminated food, through sex, from the faeces of the infected person to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug use.
The risk group for hepatitis infection includes family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people with infectious sex, men having sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting the countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular, it is recommended that vaccination be carried out to a large number of people travelling and those in the hepatitis A risk group.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hand before taking any fruit and vegetables.
hepatitis B viruses are common in contact with human blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood-flavoured olives (haembryos, rape devices), donor blood, having sex with a patient of the hepatitis, and with a mother/symptom from the hepatitis patient.
The hepatitis B risk group includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborn mothers, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people can be vaccinated; in particular, it is recommended that people of the risk group be vaccinated and persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure devices, other sharps and syringe needles, tattooing and Augusting, and use of condoms in case of potentially contagious sex, or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the National Immunization Plan in Estonia and for children free of charge.
hepatitis C viruses are common when exposed to human blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood-flavoured olanzapine, donor blood, having sex with a person with a hepatocho, and from the hepatitis patient to the foetus/syndrine.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected sex partners, men having sex with men, bred mothers, sick family members and carers, health care, rescue workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection, and travelers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and syringe needles, tattoos and August and use of condoms in case of risk of infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection occurs in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
D hepatitis viruses spread to the foetus when exposed to blood and other fluids, the needles and needles contaminated with them, the sexual route and the few infected mothers.
D The risk group for hepatitis B is chronic hepatitis B viral loads and human non-hepatial immunity to hepatitis B.
The effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses spread via fecal ororal route with drinking water and food, including low-heated beef, fish and marine carcases, donor blood, common-use syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
E preventive measures to prevent hepatitis are to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after treatment with the toilet, before preparation and eating after care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat treated beef, fish and mermaids, drink only safe drinking water and avoid taking drugs.
Although in the last round four competitions tried to get rid of the Olympic winner, 34-year-old Farah found power at the end and won in time 26.49,51.
Farah did not think long, drawing his wife Tania and children on the road after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them, ” said Farah to journalists.
Farah will set up a fifth title competition in London, with a golden double running at 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connori, “Dam’s gold. Gustav Klimt’s masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait’s extraordinary story, is much deeper than the birth story of one of the works of art in the late 19th century and the cultural history of the early 20th century.
But even more in time.
It would have been possible to take advantage of the maple-proof information, perhaps a tighter flyer, a narrower theme that would have been released in the title of the extraordinary story of the portrait.
Now there would be two books between the same covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting “Daam in gold,” presented by Adele Bloch-Bauer, as well as a much more extensive and comprehensive history book from the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna that was pulsing in the middle, and who was himself in the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life was around the Ringstrasse or how everyone in Central's cafe turned their heads when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters in one of Europe's richest cities was high and in a book you feel more culturally.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund freud acted in a city where the worst level of suicide in Europe was not enough.
Or perhaps, too, every pair-letter coating will add colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, every 10 people in Vienna had a Jew.
Adele's parents were also new entrants in Vienna, but by the time she married her two-time older Czech sugar seed Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become a seventh bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But he didn't pull the whole glamorous life he belonged to.
When you look at “Dam’s gold, ” it is hard to believe that the great lady in socialism was infected by the end of life and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Fernando Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hotest painter in Vienna.
At that time, Klimt ordered 4,000 crowns, a quarter of the price of a well-placed house.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of a master's love story with a model did not cast sugar seed.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist in the course of the work continued until the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor.
Gustav Klimt masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Baueri portrait, an extraordinary story –, Varrak 2016, translated in English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the beginning of the work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravennas San Vitale in a basil, and researchers think that the brilliant mosaics that were just seen there were keisrinna Theodora gave the artist an idea to make a golden portrait of Adele in a painted mosaig.
Klimt presented his “Dam’s gold, ” in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (in 1907-1908) was born in the second golden land.
The art historians did not notice the likeness of two women.
What about Hitler?
“To commemorate my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public, ” wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished their family’s collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had completed another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adel left in February 1925), he also asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes for the Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was abandoned to his nieces, Mary and Luis.
A year after Klimt had finished “Austria Mona Lisa, ” he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17 - year - old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw.
Although, at times, Hitler’s later anti-Semitism was considered to be the reason that Jewish professors refused to accept him at the academy, none of his investigators were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria’s will, had changed considerably in 1939, had become important in finding work for the Nazi party of Vienna’s rich Jewish art collections.
Hitler's personal art property also suited some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year trial between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
In this respect, it should be noted that if “Support ” is seen in the Castle of Belvedere in Vienna, the “Dam’s Gold ” is to be visited by New York Neue Gallery.
And before going to Vienna, you can also read the book mentioned above.
Even if you don't go to Klimt's work, because at least after closing the book, my emotions rolled more Nazi and Jewish themes than a $ 135 million painting and model of Adele Bloch-Bauer around.
So not as portrait as much as the story of a family destiny - and a very touching story.
On the contrary, it facilitated the orientation of events in the early part of the book as a family tree of Bauer.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the premiere, Gold was very close to his own 200-metal personal record swimming 2.16,62.
Tippmark dates back to the 17-year-old party from the year the Canadian Junior Championships became the 2.16,58, medias Priit Aavie's Ujumis block.
Gold got away last, or tenth grade A.
In the finals, he passed the distance of 2.15,76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
Alina Kendzior's record of Estonia's (2.15.13) remained a little more than half a second.
Gold rose to 3rd in the Estonian all-time chart, and his fresh personal topmark is the fifth result of all time in Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still on the start of the Canadian adults' championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of freedom and 200 m and 400 m of complexity.
Last week, Toronto attended the Canadian Junior Championships, and Gold made a successful start there.
He won 200 m in free-flow silver medal time 2.03.22.
It was so quickly swimd in Estonian by the debate last year in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonian recordine Elina Partõka has been swimming faster than gold.
As a Estonian resident in Canada, the pronksmedal won an excellent personal record with a new Estonian season’s top mark of 56.66.
For example, he was one century older than Kertu Ly Alek.
He reached the top mark of the person's message at the opening of the notice in order to get 100 m of the cell drive. Letter 1.03.69.
At half a longer distance, he only reached the seventh place when swimming at the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading Estonia’s season table at four different distances.
President Trump is on vacation, critics fertilising teeth
It's time for rest - that means relaxing for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the presidents who took the most holiday days off, the critics are already feeding their teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president's 17-day holiday is planned to be spent in a golf club called Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's leave started yesterday, Trump's opponents have already taken the floor for a week.
They throw too much rest for Trump.
It is a custom for the President to spend the weekend in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump has no longer rested the President during his 196 term.
For example, George W. Bush reached this time vacation for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but 21 days.
But Trump's going to have a quick nap.
A number of days after being presidented, Trump said, “60 minutes, ” that there will be no time for long leave during his guardian’s office, because there is a great need to do so.
He also expressed a bad feeling about Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “When Obama is on vacation, golf is playing, parties and jazz concerts are on the way, the ISIS journalists get their heads off.
According to the White House officials, the 17-day golf club visit isn't exactly a relaxation.
It is officially referred to as a leave of work, during which Trump has no time for reading or other activities of interest.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working time.
It's called switching out the air conditioning system in the West of the White House, which is why the entire staff had to leave.
There are also Ovaalcabinet and other offices of the President.
“I do not think that any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if there were 38 degrees and there was no air conditioning, ” said the White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work during vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you will find out about the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook should not be applied to public authorities if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew so much about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take much time for the papers to get him to get all out of internal politics until he got out of politics.
The crisis, of course, upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to shut up.
For in 1783 Washington said: “Free speech can be taken away from us, and dark and silently we may be led to slaughters by sheep, ”
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subjects have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who published their views on his official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) to court.
Kuberner’s official staff encroached the action empty, and web-commentariums threw out counter-responsibility in the style of “Keda interested. ”
“It’s just Facebook, ” said many.
But it does.
And it matters so much when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic state.
His acceptance percentage is right among the 50 governors of the state.
Hogan's not an unthinkable windhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters, for example, by showing his bald head loosely after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, the governor’s pages, which are officially marked as a public forum that is managed by the blocking of people who visit the taxpayers’ dollars, are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press agent Amelia Chase protected the conduct of the interview governor who gave the Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but modulating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, spamists, or hate-filled people on the web.
The Post had a conversation with a number of real people who Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're really people who're communicating with their elected leaders, teachers, company owners and pastors, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, well thought-out, and not bad at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan’s Catholicism.
A lawyer from Maryland, Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Raman, did not encourage anger, but rather anger crimes.
“ I was politely informed that I was disappointed because he did not respond to anger crimes or other recent news, ” he wrote The Post newsletter in a commentcombinant country.
“I do not like the idea that, if many people comment on the same subject, one immediately calls it a collective effort, rather than admit that it is a great deal of concern to citizens.
What the governor’s office called a \"directed spam attack\" would probably call \"public support\".
The Facebook Age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than the old days when workers had to be sent out to collect, and burn or arrest the protestors, and make them silence.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for biting off Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first words of judgment on this subject was held last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, the US district judge in Alexandria, decided that the chairman of the Loudoun County Monitoring Board violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voters from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after using Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers had their way of ruling.
And even then, Washington had to put an anonymous troll on the chest.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions on their land.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of a web-based George Washington collection project, he buried his office under the petitions which criticised his views on the association, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of speech, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable in the Renaissance Club
The former European pre-number Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf course of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irish who was in the neighbourhood last year before the last round of the Archerfield Links, leading Paul Eales before the fall, have begun to take the new place of play and perform the role of the winner and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvad, as well as the winner of the tournament.
“I saw the Renasance Club being built, and now we see how the club shines in full glory with this event, ” said Rafferty.
“The people see the track in their best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter in golf and he's proud of what's been achieved here.
This will make it possible to present the track perfectly.
The English Eve looks forward to protecting the masterpiece for the first time, although the man has won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year-old career.
“It sends a very special feeling, ” said a player nesting in Southport.
“I could not protect my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off a year after my victory calendar.
It's magical to come back to this cover.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember last year's memories, and for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our heart, ”
Gary Orr, who joined the Senior European tour in the beginning of this year, will return to the contestant again.
This is his first event in Scotland after taking part in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“The home to play is always a little more meaningful, ” said Helensburg’s man Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've had a huge replay, and I've seen a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy with the way things go so far.
Trio joins former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former leader of Ryder, Sam Torrance, are two of the six warriors in the race, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
Access is free of charge and car parking costs 5 pounds a car with one passenger and 10 pounds a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian golden land
If Bardina Dege's dinner is made, she won't use the gun.
He's rarely using a pot.
In the building of wood located in Enarotal, the Papua province of Indonesia, the barrier, places a bata called nota, in the local language, directly onto the firehouse.
In half an hour, the scorched mules will be taken from the fire and injected with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and at the same time he does his day - to - day chores, such as washes the laundry with the thick water from nearby sex.
The role of the move is to fill the bucket in the room without roof.
Since he is the youngest of four women in his husband, he is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamia is common here today.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the village's men to be unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
“ No one dares to visit the village after five o’clock in the evening, ” he says.
This is a rare lookout for life in the mountainous region of Papua. This is the former Dutch colony, which was added to Indonesia in 1969 after the nemesis created a referendum that made only 1026 elders under the eyes of the Okupand forces to vote.
The movement of the Dutch authorities, which inspired the release of the power of the Dutch authorities, quickly against the Jakarta Government, which remains under its strong control by avoiding foreign journalists and human rights overseers.
In 2003, the province was officially allocated to Papua and Western Papua, so that the eastern part of the island remained independent of Papua New Guinea.
The Enariotal is in the same way as a remote and abandoned place. To this end, a five-hour journey from the capital of the province to the Nabiara is to be flown from the province to the nabira for 90 minutes and then through the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bars and waves of iron roofs, which have turned the roses into yellow browns.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been almost any foreign activity here.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago’s beans worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes.
“ We were not used to wearing such clothes, ” says Degei, referring to the turbine, dark shirt, and the skirt with its colourful hands.
“ Before that, we only carried the plant leaves on the body.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and child mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's golden land.
Just 100 km from Pania, which is the mountainous province of around 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is located in the world's largest and more profitable gold mine Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
Freeport alone mined around USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here in 2015.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber stocks, which are estimated to be USD 78 billion.
However, these wealth is the source of the suffering of the popes, because they are the cause of the dazzling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times study in 2005 showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military staff between 1998 and 2004.
The efforts of the beans to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold mine and they are being rescinded.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 beans have been killed since 1969 and thousands of more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of genocide in the mountainous countries of Papua Provinces in the 1970s was measured.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested in the Indonesian police region.
The report of the Birsbane Archbishop of 2016 “We will all lose” includes evidence of the cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a particular spread in rape and the provision of electric shocks) and the gross destruction of peaceful demonstrations.
“The number of victims is difficult to read, because such incidents occur every week, ” says Andreas Harsono, an investigator from the organization Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
Kruvid is even more firmly turned on, as Papua’s natural resources have caused the influx of new dwellings from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing because of the collapses of Indonesia in Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
The Japanese family dishes sell the gado-gado-gado with chips and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
“Migrands began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market from local beans cheaper,” explains Abeth You, born 24 years old in Pania, who moved to Jaypura, the capital of the province.
‘Mama-Mama's [women] of the Pailian beans are therefore losing their market share,
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former hippo was won on its way to the Jakarta presidential palace from 29 election districts in Papua 27 including Pani.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted by Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice, ” says You.
In fact, it was only two months after Jokowi took office in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang on the Christmas table at Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle.
They were told that they should turn on the front lights.
According to the words of the local pastor Yavedt Teba, one of the soldiers came back to their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers were chasing the children and washing them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kids together.
One child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yemio, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election board building was set on fire, and the next day things were even more escalating.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice in the football field ahead of the local police station and the military control centre.
They wore ceremonial yachts and presented a waita dance of Papua's honey tribe, during which they ran around and buried a bird song.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
“ If the mass of the people is more than three times resistance, let them go, ” according to the official document that has seen TIME, but which has not been published in local media publications.
The elder of Kego Koto, the town of Enariotal, in Yereemia, Kayame (56) recognized the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“ When I turned around, I was shot at the left wrist suddenly, ” said TIME to the magazine on the veranda of a wooden house in the colors.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the lines of the assembled soldiers.
“ There was a great deal of money, a great deal of fire, ” he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot by a cousin three times.
“ I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was with him, ” said TIME in the fall of the magazine Yohanes, who uses only one name, along with many Indonesians.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him...
Captain Yotje Mende of Papua police said to the reporters that he was subject only to the security of his department because it was attacked.
“We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to be killed, ” said Komissar Pudjo Sulistiyao, a police officer in Papua in 2015.
\"This is the question of life and death: \"
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech, where he expressed compassion to the families of the victims and allowed him to deal with the abuses in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future, ” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to deal with crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, the excuses followed.
“Most crimes took place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is, we are committed to solving these crimes, but we need to follow certain processes, “he said.
On June 5th, Jakartas said that Wiranto took back his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all will be resolved according to the law ”
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights in relation to more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor during the 1999 blood independence scene, said that 11 human rights crimes have already been solved in Papua, including those in Panama.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a symphony.
“In the last three years, four times have been questioned, but no progress has been made, ” said Yohanes.
\"I'm tired,\"
He says he's still living in fear for years.
“ I am afraid, ” he says.
“I fear that the army will arrest me, and I fear that I will be shot, ”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people in Panic are afraid to break this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“ The army came looking for me to bury dead bodies, ” he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the village residents at the Panian neighboring agent in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when it became a call between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
That man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowning in the nearby rivers, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing out cops with stones, and the last ones were using a warning bill.
But according to the locals, the mobile bragads (Indonesia military) began shooting at the people, killing one person.
“We were a great panic, we were afraid of revenge, ” said Dominggu Badi, 29 years old, who lives near the hospital and saw injured in the entry.
“ I have been hiding in my house for two days, ”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the responsibility of the police involved and the return of the police's mobile brigate from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds on the dissatisfaction of the honey, many, dani, and damal tribes living in the middle of Papua.
Many of them have joined the VPL army of rebels, which, according to itself, defends the rights of the popes by organising attacks and kidnappings by chance among the Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has, in recent years, been arresting thousands of people in Panama in the defence of the sovereignty of the state.
Some of them never show up again.
Panias are known as “a tragic forgotten place ” among the people of Papua.
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
A little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread's the same unsatisfied.
People grow all their food themselves mainly in Batate, in addition to a bit of fruit and leafy fruit.
Landing is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five batats.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten Batate costs only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, economic inequality between the indigenous beans and the new migrants, which have arrived to a large extent since the opening of the new routes at the Nabire airport.
The few jobs there are, they go better for the more educated and wealthy migrants.
Payees themselves often lack capital or necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
“ Young people are not interested in staying with the village because there are no jobs or money here, ” says John Gobai, president of the Pani tribe council.
The unbundling keeps the world's eyes off Papu.
In addition, there will be tough restrictions on foreign media.
In the early part of this year, French journalists from Papua Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out because “they did not follow appropriate practices, ” although they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Mr Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Human Rights Watchi, the election promises of Jokowi have not been implemented to eliminate restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
“In Indonesia, journalists trying to report the most peaceful provinces of Papua and Western Papua are threatened with new threats of visa rejection and the inclusion of a black list, ” he said.
The lack of a frontal vision of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the nearby neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States of Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “a wide range of crimes, including the shooting in Panama.
These same countries have supported VPL in historical terms.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the press representative of the Foreign Ministry of Indonesia, threw a group of charges aside, saying to journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press, so that evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to bury –
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
On 4 May, when the Dutch official delegation visited the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar with Jayapur, the local people stopped at the meeting but, according to the source that wanted to remain anonymous, they said that they would be quiet asking: “We want freedom...
In Indonesia, new presidential elections take place in 2019, but the beans do not believe that they will vote again by Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting in Pani, ” says Hobai, President of the Council of the tribes.
He wants to make it clear to Jokowi that, in addition to the fact that the people of Panama are constantly living under threat from the predatory army, they are struggling because of the nigels' education and health services in poverty.
According to Gobai, the people of Panama, like the other beans, consider their voice to be debt to Jokowi, which he must pay.
“ They don’t need money, they want justice, ” he says.
Despite threats and fear, the families of the Panitan shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic attack they buried one of the victim's body on the police station and the country against the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on the feet, at least the defendants will not let themselves forget their crimes.
“ One of our family members was killed, ” says Yacobus.
\"What else could we do?\"
The fire was swallowed by Dubai Torchi's skyscraper for the second time.
The fire was fed through the world’s highest residential tower in Dubai on Friday, making hundreds of inhabitants out of this 37-metre and 79-storey building escape.
It's another fire that's been exacerbated in just two years by a high-rise called the Torchi Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down stairs, and we spent about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, saying to Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to the civil defence officers in Dubai, firefighters wiped out the flame about 4 a.m. at local time (0.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working for the victims to secure shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used throughout the world on the outer surface of high buildings.
The investigation carried out by the Torchi Board following the fire in 2015 found that the most damaged fascists - external ornamental panels and isolation.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of London’s Grenfeld Tower and the Fascad Panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
See: these phones are probably going to be selling buildings in the autumn.
In spring and autumn, it is a sweet time for tech fans, because then telephone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, as well as in the autumn, new hit-phones are expected.
According to Kristjan Seema, the director of Tele2 marketing and sales, the present flag ship is characterised by an innovative design, an ophthalmic scanner, a edge-to-side 4K resolution with an screen and a high-speed processor.
In the technology world, Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In autumn, it allows people of crying interest to be even more free of charge, more durable battery, more high quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of hearings, there are already assumptions and predicting four top models that would probably take over the promotional sales tables.
These four top models of smart phones will be available to the poets in the fall of this year.
The districtd iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should be reached by mid-September.
The rumors, however, what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not produce significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be fully distinguished from previous models.
There are four colours spoken: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
The new design is probably one of the elements of the screen that covers the whole phone’s front panel, lost on the home button and the finger reader is built in the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been a ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the ophthalmic scanners, wireless loading and even more high-quality camera, a more rapid A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one year's waiting for smart phones.
A new model for Galaxy Note 8 will begin on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
More business users are reportedly meant to be involved and S Pen provides even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one with a width and one with a narrower field of view.
Now no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is the first test of Samsung, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to 23 August.
Even though Nokia has sold three smartphones this year in front of Nokia 6, there are still no tickets to their ship - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August.
We look forward to a screen and a high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
There are also reports of aluminium housing and significant water and dust resistance levels of IP68.
Like Samsung, the new model of Nokia has two rear cameras that are optically produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functions are added.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better camera.
On Sony's new model, it has been speculated that its screen is at least six toll.
In reality, we can already see the right head, as traditionally Sony has published its autumn flagship on the International Technology Fair of IFA, which will take place between 1 and 6 September this year.
According to the leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico on payment for border wall
The Washington Post published the transscriptions between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On January 27, Trump called the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto to end his public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States broke a wall for public judgment, saying: “You must not say this to the press, ”
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern American border and swore to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transscriptions were also published on his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals the intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take refugees to Australia was “serious, ” “serious,” and “serious, ” he claimed, that the agreement that was made during Obama’s government would leave him an impression, as he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded by informing Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant speech of the day, ”
The Supreme Court did not consider OÜ MRP Linna Liinid’s complaint in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the carriage of bus services by bus from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an Implementing Regulation, which was rejected by OÜ MRP Linna Liinid tender for Tartu bus procurement, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Abihtin, Director of the City Government of Tartu.
It is a public bus transport project within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP The Linna Liins appealed to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekend festival is disturbing their nights and the whole city is full of partyers, there are many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any shyness or rudeness.
Even I saw the kindness, ” says Laine.
“ It is good that they come, be happy and enjoy Pärnu, which has been left in winter, ” adds it joyfully.
Laine's dream is not disturbed.
When living in the city centre, he still heard music playing on the beach, music hasn't reached his home yet.
“ But I hope to hear it, ” he says joyfully.
Agnes, who has spoken to the evening paper, also says that the festival is good for Pärnu - it helps the local merchants to move well.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't bother a girl with a party noise.
Even though I'm no longer on the beach, I'm glad the beach's alive.
And it is great that the people are moving, and it has been three times that way, ” says a woman.
I think the first time it was a little worse.
“ There may have been complaints, ” she meditates.
But the noise on the beach, he said, is common for the sovereigns.
“ This Weekend is a very good promo for our little city, ” says Harri, hiding in the park.
The noise and the madman hasn't been in the charm of his life rhythm either.
What about Mijaoks?
We should all stick together.
Think of how it would be better to communicate between nations.
A loud music man doesn't make a mess.
It doesn't bother, even though I live near there.
“ These people can keep together, and there is no trouble, ” he says.
The visitors to Pärnu are, according to him, polite.
“ Of course, they’ve overdoed a little, but young people are young and the Lord’s God - given gift, but be human and we can do it, ” he says.
By then, the coastal residents have traveled somewhere away, whether they are relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general the festival’s life has a positive impact on people like this noise, ” says Tiina, who walked with the children of Pärnu.
His family's dream does not interfere with festival memory either, although last year it came even further from the present.
Last summer there was another stage, then we heard more.
We live out of the city ourselves, saying, ‘ It really comes down there quite well along the Pärnu River, ’ he says.
Pearson cuts more 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, Pearson, the British educational company, said that he would cut back 3,000 jobs and reduce his intermediates by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to resolve the business threatening tension.
The lost jobs, which, according to the Executive Director John Fallon, are highly likely at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million USD) under the third cost reduction programme to try to revitalize the business that has become a whore due to the rapid digital transition.
The company that agreed to sell last month the stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations in relation to the year have not changed since the sales revenue was reported for 1 % of the 1 % increase in the first half of the year of the 25.05 billion pounds.

Air raid in Kabul: the suicide attack was killed by NATO soldier
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked military forces in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and several others in wounded.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombardment is the last act of violence that has been hit by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed by Herat's Mosheer attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with an explosive made by a man and made by himself.
According to the application, everything is in a stable state and is being treated at the U.S. military hospital in Bagram Airport.
According to Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) are always a major source of concern for the forces in Qarabaghis NATO Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017 at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people killed a major bomb attack in the city centre - most deaths have led to a military attack in the country since the United States-led troops were disincented by the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of United States forces and police forces.
According to Correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul over recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancelled its decision to postpone the suspension
The United States of America Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew the decision to delay the adoption of the Obama Regulation, which obliges States to limit the amount of emissions to be caused, one day after the 15 States were sued by the Agency due to this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue to ‘2015 with ozone-determination operations’, late on Wednesday, saying that it shows the commitment of the Agency to cooperation with States Parties.
“We believe that we need to hold dialogue with our states and to listen to them, ” said Scott Pruitt, Head of EPA.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to postpone the determination of ozone content in the different parts of the country, in order to determine where it should be reduced by one year to October 2018 to meet a stricter air quality standard.
15 The majority of the democratic states, together with the Columbia circuit, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama. Trump says this is part of a broader growth growth market plan.
But these aspirations have created counter-reacts among the Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased effects of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air may reduce lung performance and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
The German swine and bovine animals may come to a party, as strong rains threaten the catch of another wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that the rainfalls of the weeks before harvest may mean that the cereals intended for the bread industry are only fit for animal feed.
“The quality of this is far worse than dust and poorer than in 2015, ” said Agravis Raiffeisen Analyst Bernhard Chila.
This year, up to 40 percent of the German wheat can go to animal feed, double in comparison with the usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry first.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by the heat wave in June.
In July, Germany hit the rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvests.
So far, only five percent of wheat is harvested.
Most of the area has not even started harvests, reported the local catch collector Ceravis.
“It is a very difficult day, ” said Frank Deckert, an elder dealer in Ceravis, Rendsburg.
Comparing in everything, maybe the planks of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the messice interiors, because through large windows, Saimaa’s calificed views reach many rooms (life).
At every step, the effort of our northern neighbours will begin to create both harsh and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
Implementation and compliance also merit the ability of Finns to use wood in construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products.
Vital techniques and smart solutions can be found in the messhouses as well as in the building (houses).
There it is evident that black, white and grey shades of shades, if these are complementary woodtones and room plants, may be highly moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the honey will last until 13th August.
The supplies and spices suggest that it is often used in this kitchen.
The night against today was drawn to the Weekend Festival Baltice and Martin Garrix gave everything to remember as the last performer.
At the time of Garrix's performance, the people were really turned around - singing, singing, singing, dancing on their own.
When Garrix finished, the common mass was scattered from Pärnu's beach to the city.
We'll get you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried for three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible conflict
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at the collision course to go to the most binding boxing category in the near future for up to 66,7 kg of weight, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, in separate rooms until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council of Lightweights, walked the second end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization's Sulgweight Championship.
After a unanimous decision by Garcia, the winner of the former four-time world Master Adrien Broner, on Saturday, in Showtime, both fighters are in the pretext of the balance table.
Garcia handed her right hand and said: “How are you doing, champion?
I wish you luck.
Lomachenko protects his belts with Miguel Marria against Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple of photos were positioned, Lomachenko Mändezer Egis Klimas noted that a possible match between the fighters would be \"complete measurement\".
“I’m a sulquitous former, ” recalled Garcia.
\"I'm going up to [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he has to move up a light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then let us offer them this.
Lomachenko agreed.
\"The Pox world needs this fight:
At the club, he raised the question of whether it should be paid. This is part of his strategy to allow Lomachenko to depress the end of this year in a class of 61.2 kg to make it possible for next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 Nokautis) who also have an interest in fighting Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match winner after their 23 September light-weight title round Forum.
“The viewing of this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this resistance, ” said Garcia, later saying that she was open to the fight on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We’re the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready...
Garcia said that he thought Lomachenko was a powerful fighter, and he could go see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in thanking Garcia, saying that she thought that she saw three divisjon masters from Riverside “very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it out of the way, ”
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the strength of the impact and then to pick up.
Both confirmed that they were feeling the tension between them for the struggle of wealth.
“This is a fight that is waiting for realization.
No other match makes so much attention and foggy.
I'm more than willing to work for it,\" said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: “I have been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly what it is.
This will be a good fight.
What corners of the world are moved to Estonia?
Mulu extended and re-issued by the Police and Border Guard Office (PPA) for more than 13 000 third-country nationals who have traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if a fixed-term residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, then the rate was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, this figure will begin to reach close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased sharply during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to the statistics of the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia - the bubble arrived in Estonia in 850 Ukrainian citizens more than left.
“ The Ukrainian community has been great all the time in Estonia, and because of the complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already in front of, ” stated Kristin Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had received a temporary residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although over ten years there has been the highest number of fixed-term residence permits issued for the last.
When Ukrainians come here to work hard, Russian citizens are here because of family migration.
“ By considering this historic Russian community, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia, ” said Helina Maasing, migration scientist at the Home Guard Academy.
“If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to live, after Harjumaa is immediately after East Virginia, he added, and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu received a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permits decreased.
“The reason for this is that a new residence permit has been applied for for for permanent residence in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit,” explained Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for from the previous year by foreigners who have lived for at least three years.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of adaptable people.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also been reduced because of the new residence permit.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state no longer makes it clear whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit was popularly popular - the applicants were still the owners of the grey passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same many Chinese, received a residence permit for residence in Estonia.
The total number of applicants in the first half of this year is 1269.
In ten years, suddenly Nigeria has become a country whose nationals are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, the soil was 200.
Nigeria is going to come to this university to study.
Estonian higher education schools are also popular among the Georgians, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of people in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to their studies.
They too have the rule that where the community had come to be, it would be easier to see others, in addition to Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
A year when some 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit, it is about 0.46 percent of the entire population.
Even if more citizens of the European Union were to believe, the migration remains about a percentage, the Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Agency, 14 822 people traveled to Estonia, but out of here 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded another year's migration.
Most of the people are Estonian citizens, but more are amongst those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was low in 2000 people.
Estonians, in particular, travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture Princessesmoods with sats, tats and tüll
There are still history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: “I had hours to dream in a museum and admire old thieves and cracks.
If you do something with a passion, you'll study and learn more about it every day.
It's an discovery pleasure!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to some of the aliens, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I've got a girlfriend with a whole sauna full of my creation's haute country dress.
For neither is it his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not come on the red carpet every day, and he wants to wear them the most beautiful dress and wear it!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and the grey everydays.
That was exactly the thought of rolling the plan to bring high-school fashions into Estonia's countryside, between forests and fields, to people, to whom the fashions often do not reach.
For example, Mammu's collection was presented on the Võrus, Jõhvi and Pärnu moealle, where 45 models of royal dolphins filled the street.
There's a lot of people in Tallinn who'll be in the shop, they'll be embarrassed, but there's more emotions elsewhere - call bravo, they'll get up, they'll want to thank you by hand.
A big part of the audience came to reform, but now they're the fans of Mammu Couture.
If you cross people's expectations, they'll be inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my manners.
Pärnu was a 50-metre red carpet, full of beautiful dresses all over the street, didn't look like they're coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't admit that the creation must be presented to a super-model supermodel, she's happy to bring ordinary women on stage.
Often I invite my own customers to the stage - they've always been happy.
This is such a wonderful experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance before, I've always been behind the stage to give the last color to the hopeless perfectionist thing.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look at the canal.
Maria is the sort of fashionist who doesn't just want to play a representative role, but in everything else.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collections I do myself.
I like the whole process you play with details, you find out.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not limited to design, it's also theistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to take off a day of one temperaments.
Well, these hours of unemployment are still huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless lucky day: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Many times it's been said that my dress has magic - they make themselves known as a princess.
The decent satirs that made Maria's talent famous all night have remained the signature of Mammu Couture.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian sub-group tournament was now turned against us
I'm sorry, I'm out of fairy tale.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get our desk.
And when there is such a difference in the table, there is nothing to do, ” commented Eesti U18 basketball boys 61:75 of our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
Opponents took 28 balls from the assault table and therefore received so much more attacks.
We were not ready to defend them, nor to attack them, it created them.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build a defense.
But in defense, they were able to keep their hands between their hands, and we couldn't combine.
It hit the crew's legs.
The household work of the opponents was better done.
According to Müürseppa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take off the attack.
Last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents had already received several quick baskets.
Atletheism and a close reaction, which was our weapon on the sub-group tournament, all of which now turned against us.
Today, we did not have the strength to resist their aggression.
The wall was left with its guardian in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, and so far there was a single punch box.
It's a shame that you've already met someone who's been so aggressive about it.
Tass has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried quite a burden.
But he did some pretty move I've seen before in practice, ” added the instructor.
The following are true numbers: in these basketball boxes, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points on three quarters...
The U18 age class is not only a basketball tournament in Tallinn for young men, the EMI B-divisjon, and the girls started over in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just...
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained at week 16:16.
On both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, third point...
At the beginning of two minutes, the Estonians hit two pieces of the first shot, and then 25 pieces of the game, then one in three and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 shots was hit.
In addition, 2 points came from the four free cutbacks.
There was a reasonable number of pollings in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had bourgeois 33 and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has begun two losses, it has to be acknowledged that Portugal 83:56 had to be better on the opening day.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for the scheduled port visit to complete ship supplies and prepare for the above exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare to return to the sea and thus give crew members the opportunity for a couple of days' leave.
After visit, NATO ships remain in Estonian waters to conduct a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations to search for historic explosives.
“The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation in local waters is well reflected in our integration with allied forces, ” said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Commander of the Marine fleet’s command line of operation and planning.
As of 29 June, the Latvian Navy commander Gvido Laudup will be running NATO's 1st mine control group, who has taken over the duties of the Chief of Team in Riga from the Estonian Marine Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elia in Seljamaa.
The flagship of the Group is designated as the Latvian Marine Support Ship in LVNS Virsait, which also operates the group’s management team.
This semester also includes the composition of an international unit of the Estonian Navy's mine hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of vessels under NATO's military command is NATO's 1st mine control group, one of the first high-speed response units, which allians can send to different world places within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgetta Festival, which was invited to life by the maestro Er Klas, will be considered 13 years ago.
According to Risto Joost (36) the artistic leader of the Tallinn Philharmonic Festival is now beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The opera world’s classics include “Taviata and “Tosca”, Ballets from the dazzling “Bolerost” from the fun “Karlssonini” and also do not lack its own production, which is then the wonderful Oratorium of Joseph Haydni, “Apartners, ” set up by the same international creative team, who brought to Pirital stage another masterpiece “Loomin” in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre contests.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose snow will take power and never let go.
Because the experience that a listener can get in this superior and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and affect human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the first artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the maestro Erik Klasi look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He's heading me through my entire student career, and he's also supporting the division career at the beginning.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue her work.
Eri Klas has injected the Birgetta Festival team so much kindness and, of course, it's all over me.
It was great to join the team who knew exactly how things were going.
The great heart of Eri Klasi also gave me the strength to move on with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could the audience do at the festival this year, and what is your special offer?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and as a surprise, the first ballet, written by Astrid Lindgren, comes to the presentation.
‘Karlsson flies to this end’
And one of the evil nynes about that is that the author of this ballet is Juris Karlsons, the Latvian composer, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He's probably had Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how can you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on other people, as far as I am myself, or how I stand up to every new day.
And such awareness of tone, keeping positiveness and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially this week, when you're most important, I've been exercising it very much, and it's working.
The smile of itself activates the brain and increases the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half things about their own body, which the universe offers them, but, by the way, everyone will discover it gradually.
Now, we're about to have an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you hit the conductor's counter?
Yes, we have to change our clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, I don't have a chance to rest or make a little nap before the big event.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before they enter the division unit.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover, not to the great opera and the ballet friend!
Look at the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the tests for the age assessment of the Swedish Asylic Applicants were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among the asyl seekers, during which their old age was evaluated with a new approach medically. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were assessed older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Judicial Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) started the tests in the beginning of this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of age in the course of the application for asyl after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverke) was criticised for having failed to correctly determine the age of several alleged minors.
As of now, Migrationsverket has sent out 6880 cases for testing and the Court of Justice Institute has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) was evaluated as 18 years or older and, in 25 other cases, the Court’s Institute assessed that “may be 18 years old or older”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the human being is ‘in some cases younger than 18’.
The test shall be used only if the age of the person is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Christian Medicine, the results are consistent compared with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent, ” said The Local.
The fact that a large part of the cases were assessed older than 18, does not necessarily mean that the acetyl seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute performed 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases there were indications that the person being examined was 18 years old or older.
But if the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases were humanly claimed that it would be received this year 18.
This medical age assessment method, whereby smart teeth are made from X-rays and knee-fly MTRs, after which they are used to be analysed by dentists and radioologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include an evaluation of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed the puberty before or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the current measurement method should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we should not make a face that we can, “he said to Metro’s newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of forensic medicine protected the accuracy of the tests: “It is common to say that the risk of unbiased adult divorce is low.
The greatest risk of about 10% is when the person is a little less than 18 –

A 20-year-old left-over Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London MM, receiving a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest woman in M.M.M.M.O., and the joyful wife confirmed that she was hoping to fight for the medals in the future.
The contest went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately took my average score, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, ” said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall of Orel didn't interfere because he's training winter through TUT Stadium.
“ I’m scratched, ” she said, “with a little mule.
The London Olympic Stadium almost had a full house of people, did Orel sense people around himself or could he turn himself off?
I get it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it's going to give you more, that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel assured me that he would stay at peace with the MM debut, and he would expect many more good competitions: “I came here with the 32nd or last result of the season this year, I finished on 18.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MM is the only thing that matters.
I'm taking a good experience, and some days I want to compete on behalf of the Medals.
The governor of West Virginia reported a party exchange
Governor Jim Justice of the Western Virginia Democrat announced that he would exchange parties at the meeting with President Trump on Thursday night.
“Let it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me, ” said Governor Justice.
“Today I say to you, having prayed freely and thought after... today I say to you, the West Virginias, that I cannot help you as a democratic governor no more, ”
At the gathering, joy was expressed.
“ This will make me a Republican tomorrow, ” added Justice.
“As a trainer, I would tell you, it’s time to play another game, ”
Trump had previously promised a great deal of announcement at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and the coal industry is his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) announced that ‘the party exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to the democratic party, which would, rather, prevent the country from getting better than working for it’.
“For almost 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - the governor Justice notice is simply the most recent mention of the parties that have been led to the end and are unable to find a positive message, ” said the president of RNC Ronna McDaniel’s declaration to CBS News.
There's no surprise there's a lot of injured people in there.
Last night, Urmet, who was in the medical tent at Weekend, said that they had to share quite a lot of patches.
The flowers and berries are basic, out of the shattering and light falls.
Of course, the pains of head, back and leg.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false shoes and so problems come.
The doctors have also had to assist visitors with a few major injuries - some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
Also, we have made stitches when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams will be done here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe accepted the Russians' honest apology for the doping candal
Sebastian Coe, an international navigator of light power, accepted his words: “I am sorry about the four days of Venice, for the doping scandal, but he repeated that now is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, Russian noseman Dmitry Shylakhtin, said at the IAF Congress that the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and has a strong purpose to fight the doping.
He apologized “of all the light - powermen who have been beaten by gold medals and silver medals at the competitions, ” he said.
Despite his comments, the IAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining a ban on competition introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of the country's supported doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest response today, with a very honest presentation, ” said IAF President Coe to journalists.
“The Health Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian alliance itself acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to restructure the alliance.
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its restoration criteria.
“I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that it is not the right time to withdraw Russia,” said Coe.
“We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system, ” he added.
Nine of Russia's light-powers, which meet the strict criteria of IAF, compete as neutral athletes on Fridays in London.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Group, said on Monday that Russia did not meet a number of restoration criteria yet.
After a report to the IAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks were still insufficient and that the trainees who had been banned still acted freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are winners and losers?
Little that the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Even though mines like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies will not help.
Now Glencore is serving coal and oil, but the demand for coconut, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will continue to grow during the time of electric cars.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and the Norwegian governments have increased their contributions to the expansion of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be prohibited in the coming decades.
As such, Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring the cheaper Model 3 electric cars on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that in the past two decades, electric cars will be sold more than oil-producing cars.
“ For some metals, it changes everything, ” said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranni Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as caves and lithium, which have grown in demand for many years.
The electric cars have about three times more copper than the ordinary car, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, so Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for batteries for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will become the growing trend of electric cars to income from the copper price increase and the world's largest caver producer, predicted by the Jefferson Group.
According to this brokering company, the winners of other electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the world's metal market in London has been expensive from the cave.
The price increase was 37 percent.
The copper has also grown 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20 per cent in London, with a price increase above the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America.
On the losing side, there are companies dealing with lead, such as Recilex and Campine, who have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the pli is the battery supplying the starters of petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
‘This is a serious risk to the demand for lead, unless other purposes are found to overcome the fall in demand,’ said Michael Widmer, the director of the analysis of the Bank of America Merill Lynch's metal market.
The impact of the rolling trend in the form of a pli price movement is not yet noticeable.
Plii has increased 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems for metal far away in the future.
“I’m not sure it’s so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition, ” said the sales manager of Triland Metals, Herwig Schmidt.
When lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
It might happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, more stringent exhaust standards mean that hybrid cars demand, which are dependent on advanced lead-based batteries when starting frequent engines, will be assessed by the International Organisation for Lead and zinc Research.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, as the lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This explains already an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the total aluminium production in the world.
Probably this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has now increased by 13 per cent, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnologies for the production of pickets.
ArcelorMettal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
“The high-speed steel should be the answer to this development, ” said Exane BNP Paris analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There are some successes in Europe.
The end of the naftajus can also bring suffering to the platinum.
It took about half of this precious metal to be catalytic converters for diesel engines, reported by the metal transformer Johnson Matthey.
“At present, raw materials with high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be high demand in the future, ” said the Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahkh.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Plastic manufacturers believe that there is a continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
In the 10-year period, the great hope of the platinum producers is on hydrogen-based cars developed by the Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
Until then, however, this technology has still not justified itself in a commercial way.
“Diis appears to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars, ” said Exane BNP of Paris Brunet.
In July, the German car manufacturers received a large feedback as the Stutttgart court prohibited the use of the diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football financial rules affect Neymar’s transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona Club in Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the governing body, which is in charge of the European game, and has the power to prohibit the participation of the team in the Prestitial League of Masters tournament, will wait only before Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules of the UEFA 2011 fair game (FFP) mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
For Barcelona, 222 million euros (262 million dollars) were paid alone for buying Brasiillan out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the Neymar club in France.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to recruit Neymari and add such money to its star-end rivals, given that the team is financed by the family of the Katar energy offender.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in football.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that are going to succeed in finding large debts are actually engaged in fraud and risking corruption if banks or owners would have to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 at Chelsea - to buy a potential club and then to make big expenses to make the team better and create a global brand is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the shame that Platin was rejected from the presidential office in 2015, his successor, UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still committed to preventing excessive consumption.
“FFP is certainly not dead, and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules, ” said The Associated Pressile Andrea Traverso, who is the UEFA supervisor last week.
While PSG paid for Neymar’s acquisition clause as a single full payment, it is possible for them to allocate this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract and it is therefore possible to show the transitional fee for the next five years as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year.
With regard to the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with the Manchester City of Abu Dhabi, received the most serious penalties.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at this time EUR 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Team of Masters during the 2014-2015 period to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over regulatory financial institutions, bringing up their income through companies related to club owners.
However, if the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This is how it happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG’s support value was recovered.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymari's PSG service can come from Katarist via the 2022 World Championships Management Committee.
However, PSG and Katar 202 deny that Neymarist could be a world champion and that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily expose such a manoeuvring.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any aspirations to ignore rules.
People who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition with PSG Neymar in advance.
They talked to The Associated Press provided their anonymousness as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in turnover during the 2015-2016 season.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30 % in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset by leaving one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“This is a clear ‘financial doping’ case with the club and the state, ” said AS, President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spain, referring to the fact that PSG is primarily a member of the Katar.
Arsene Wenge, whose club belongs to the American sports seed, shares La Liga's attitude that the state finances the club.
“This is the result of ownership rights and has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years, ” said Wenger on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the state, everything will be possible.
It is very difficult to respect the fair financial rules of the game, since the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country.
Norwegian, Norway's low-cost airline, is a good tradition of putting on an airplane course the images of those who have shifted borders in their field and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee
Together with the expansion of Norwegian operating geography, the circle of people who have earned the place in aviation has expanded.
Among selected persons, for example Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (populate) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one plane will begin to be decorated by the legendary Queen singer Freddie Mercury portrait.
Today 50 years ago: the storm of the orange dimension in Estonia, which was torn by roofs and windows from the houses.
The Orcs mentioned as the storm of the century, which, on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa, in particular.
In North Estonia, during these days, the wind was above 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one dead tree to another in the garden, and he looked at them with hands to support them.
It was all dark and cramped, like the end of the world.
Back in 2002, the roofs were already flying from the houses, reminding Linda Kurova Haapsalus magazine about the interview given by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her planted garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do about the trees with your hands, where do you get that kind of storm?
The sea came under the window, from the windows into the water, saying that Mrs Linda was living on the street of Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown from 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalans, just like the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely down, some in half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm went through all the beautiful old trees like a war.
In August 1967, West Virumaa did not suffer particularly badly compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was high there, wrote the Virumaa Official Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were wiped off the ground, but also the parks of our candle were severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
At the Tallinn Seafield, a tiny girl called: “Ema, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and are no longer able to ‘ write the Virumaa Official Journal. ’
During the storm, the Põll Manor building in Viljandimaa was destroyed in such a way that it was decided to be demolished later.
Augustithorm did not oppose the constructions of the Türi ski mountain, which was no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the newspaper Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and the inhabitants could be involved in cleaning work.
Crop fields were also affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that \"partial organisations must be both incentives and direction in cleaning work and crop harvests\".
Orcans can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the pure wind in Estonia will remain from 2 November 1969 when Ruhnul was measured as the speed of the wind 48 m/s.
So the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of soft bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The coldest summer worlds also mean a smaller cleaning gap in Tallinn's bathing beaches.
“ If there is no air, people are at the beach, and if there is no, there are no people, ” says the beach cleaner.
The shores of the North-Tallinna Stroma are screaming.
They offer melodic competition for a low-speed humming tractor that runs down the stripes on the plate.
In fact, the last seven centimetres deep through the sand, picking out the seagrain and the rest of people left behind: bottle caps, cigarettes, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether or not water is warm.
If there is a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people, ” says Alexander Usov, Head of the Haaberst Administration of the beach cleaning work.
It's 6:30 and there's a bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at eight o'clock, the place must be good for people.
Usov's already at 4:00.
After Stroma, he'll keep an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Lake Kakumäe and Paljasaare on the Pikakari beach.
The quantities of waste have decreased.
Years ago, it was much more than that.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them, says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before something new came up, it was the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the major works on the Estonian shores is the cleaning of the sea desolate or adru.
For example, on Pirita beach it must be carried 400 000 tonnes after the beach season.
“This is an incredible amount, ” says Usov.
The second large category is the straw, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large landfill containers on the beach strip of Strome, which need to be empty three times a week.
That's how much garbage happens.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that garbage is less than a fifth.
The third type is made up of abandoned items.
Mostly these are children's lives.
This time, the Usov sand has been humming out of the inside of a ten-way model car.
They remain waiting for the owners on the beach.
“They are likely to come out more, but it is a normal prey, ” Usov already knows that he will soon find them again inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
Disperse the waste
Erika Scheller, a representative of the administrative services of Haaberst, admits that the rolling work of the tractor is disrupting local.
The noise that lasts from night hours to early morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
It's impossible on the day.
One month, the beach has to go through twice.
“If we do not do this, the part of the city will punish us, ” notes Scheller.
However, the aim is to get the Stramoma beach to the international bluewood quality label, similar to Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
“In comparison with Europe, Estonia has much more work to ensure that the beaches are maintained, ” says Scheller.
We've got more Adru and stones, and it's harder to go around sand.
But there is less garbage on our shores than elsewhere in Europe.
When they hear that the beach is talking about garbage, Martin, who lives near the Beach of Stroma, is going to enter the discussion circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current constraints on the beach.
There's a wild picture all over the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle caps that have pulled the garbage bags off, Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their practices, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and, for example, put on their cover to prevent birds from reforming there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the Beach of Strom.
I see the city takes care of it.
It has become more pleasant with children's fields, lighting and freshly asfalted roads.
There was a time when the rollers could only travel one way,” says Martin.
Founding treasures in Strome: coins, only coins
In the morning, 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use, who, as a treasure hunter, is combing a beach edge with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he's gonna find anything precious today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough to do this.
“ I have been dealing with it for a year and have not found anything valuable yet, ” reports Dmitri.
As a Hobiardeküt, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails, which later throws into the garbage can.
Usually there's coins.
“There are usually no balls, rings, and no other leg, ” notes a treasurer.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to receive a notice that interest rates will remain at the previous level, as the growth of the economy and the reduction of inflation have made speculation less attractive as regards the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will stay low, as household income has put interest rates on waiting.
Policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of holding 6:2 rates at 0.25% and less members will require an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on households' incomes is still expected to increase by 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that during the next few years, the increase in rates is necessary to control inflation due to Brexit and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs may be necessary in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of partial withdrawal of the economic mammoth package that had been put into effect as a result of Brexit one year ago.
In February, the Bank will complete a fixed-term financing scheme that provides banks with cheap financing, although it has now said that 15 billion pounds are expected to be offered, with 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the decision on the definition, the Bank says: “The medium-term forecast of the Euro-Mediterranean gross domestic product (GDP) will not be reached in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to have an impact on consumption –
As regards the definitions, it was repeated that, in order to mitigate inflation, it was necessary to \"take some effort on the financing policy – and to the extent that it was expected to be \"higher than anything else in the markets.
The exchange rate is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that all jumps are step-by-step and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and for the next year are comparable to the forecast for May by 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for the 1.8% increase in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the nail exchange rate for the dollar and the euro fell.
The pound fell to USD 0.5% to USD 1.31 and EUR 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have reduced the growing expectations of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will be a little slow.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to make it a little worse before the improvement.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income from hitting in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak nail, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partly compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision will come after a year when the rates were reduced by 0.25% in the last August after the shock of the EU referendum, which caused the sudden deterioration of the skin.
The Bank considers that four years are likely to be spent in order to fully boost prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision had been to feel the growing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in a high-speed economy; in July three policy makers called for an increase in the rate of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank's message was unexpected and the next few months is expected to rise again.
The Bank said that an excessive increase compared to a 2 % target was due to a completely weak female.
Andrew Montlake, the leader of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: “In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is getting more competitive again, as creditors are eager to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose transactions are to be completed, as refinancing, often free of charge and low rates, has become increasingly popular.
NHS has been writing an HIV drug that causes conflict to affect 10,000 people
Patients have since September access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention after the battle at the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that during the initial three-year clinical trial, public health is now estimated to make up to 10,000 people pre-exposure (PrEP) tablets, which are given prior to the interim administration and which have shown a reduction of approximately 86% in the risk of infection in people at high risk.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's own claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, acting director of NHS England, welcomed this activity announced on Thursday as “new large-scale intervention” while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as “a turning point”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first people to register. Oktobri adds further clinics before the program is launched anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that will be taken before the interim procedure to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
Clinical trial results indicate that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
Before taking PrEP, it means that there are enough medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before the mid-term.
For treatment, suitable candidates include homo- or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
The clinical trials shall identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those whose HIV-infected partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs 10 million pounds and NHS England signed the contract to receive the medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence for the person to whom the medicine is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new wide-ranging intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind’s greatest health problems:
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and is not dependent on the partner, thereby improving many lives through a clinical trial funded by NHS.
We warmly welcome this announcement:
The Executive Director of Terrence Higgins, Ian Green, said: “Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is carried out quickly across the country and that no members of the HIV risk group are excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial medicine has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Public health shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the clinical trial in PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and the government’s feet are drawn.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can lead to the prevention of HIV and the cessation of the spread of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial is taken over as soon as possible to protect people with HIV exposure and to take us a step closer to stopping HIV spread in society –
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia and fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
The difference between the next day’s stock exchange price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1,94 compared to EUR 7,71 in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is Lithuania-Sweden's failure.
The average exchange price for electricity in Estonia last month was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36,27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was at the same time EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
The prices increased by 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the hours last month moved from Estonia to Estonia and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place in the next day.
In 99 percent of Estonia, electricity moved from Lätti to Lätti and 73 percent of hours was in use.
According to the transactions carried out on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX can be the stock exchange price for electricity in August at approximately EUR 34 and in September 37 from the megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at a price of 5,04-5,47 EUR/tonne.
High living - semi-storey and smart design buttons have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, the former banker, who is a passionate real estate renewal, exchanged his large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold his apartment, it is a tribute to the new design.
“ Before that, I lived on a much larger surface with my former partner in Knightsbridge, ” said Joanne.
“I bought something that would be equivalent to my price.
I was shown to the Earls Court apartment, and it had similar high loans.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day...
Since the first visit, this 93-ruth apartment has completed a complete innovation course.
At first, it was a one-bedroom and a complex dressing apartment - it had to walk through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to make use of the high floors.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, ” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from architectural and design studio in Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to use the 3.8 m heights of flats and create a home that is not just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The loan was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was architectural challenge to create a semi-corporation where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“The metal structure is quite complex, ” she explains.
“We had to reorganise the premises, so that they were on each other without having to freak out.
This was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the top and bottom space is correct.
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two rooms with full heights with many dramatic elements in the room.
In half the floor, the old light opens up to the glamorous living room in the retrouvius window.
The golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and retro-sounding Serge Mouille luminaire highlight the room style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theater, space and lightliness.
The mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor so that it seems longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror leaves the window opening in the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cap offers a deposit box for all Joanne's dining instruments and glassware.
The living room adds a magic option to close the kitchen section unless it is used by creating a more glamorous space.
There's nothing new for me to put together.
However, there is a unique fact in this kitchen that it is a type of garage to be raised door.
“There went a little design gap, ” explains Erfan’s steel support spyed on MDF’s door.
“There is a counterbalance, therefore, it is very slippery if it is rejected.
With the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra ridges, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“At the end of the tracks, the floor floor is what you sell or what gives value to real estate, ” says Erfan.
‘The real estate broker enters the obsolete form of the room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor:
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are what you touch and thus help you create emotional ties with your home, ” says Erfan.
\"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It is important, but it does not make the tongue of the heart ring.
This shows that the good design and the increased area will help to do something quite amazing from the usual apartment.
In fact, they may cause a desire not to leave, as did Joanne.
Chief Agent Dane Jensen is a Chicago high-rise high-rise hunter who competes with my colleague for the promotion.
It does not count as a sum of money other than what is earned, with all kinds of ethics forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I think that this is a version of the Kaardihouse, a business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler speech manager.
The more the film goes on, the less it will be, the less it will be, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers will continue to shine.
A life-changing experience becomes cancer for the main person.
Now there is a choice between working life and family life.
The son of an architect's office puts his father on walks to the big buildings of Chicago thinking about matters of real importance, such as faith, goodness, love..., not even the double tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, it becomes the feeling that filmmakers are determined to get the audience to cry, because even the most horrid person with the heart can't hold back the tears with a sweet cancer of the boy's suffering.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father will be able to fully understand the morality of his work and do good work for an old man seeking work.
Now, I'm gonna bet on myself - if the movie has a happy ending, then I'm going to premeditate my insight after the movie's coffee, if I'm wrong, then the script can be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'll be out of coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he's gonna slow down to the hall.
The son, however, has been wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel well too - I can quite predict the end of the American drama!
By giving the truth the film is well-structured, all the necessary elements exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure it'll bring the movie in well.
Trump's new head of staff is planning to limit the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really handle it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Head of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the water.
There's a bitter reporter from Josh Dawson:
“When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with high officials on his first working day, he brought out the key problem of President Donald Trump in the White House, which he was planning to resolve the lack of information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if she had to share good information.
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track her media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television extends beyond decades, and now that he's in the White House, his television viewing exercises aren't missing anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, he was paid to show that he was also well reflected in the impressive publications, ” said the former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg, Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at that time that “the six former campaign workers say Trump is the key to managing Twitter habits, as long as it ensures that its personal media consumption also contains a stable guitar song.
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been “controlled, ” is ridiculous.
Maybe those campaign workers know something we don't know about the rest of us that Trump's sparks would have been even more lit up without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about the sparks Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently producing his mother-in-law.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House, composed of competing clicks, are trying to promote themselves exclusively by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president with strategicly questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
“Primals and former Trump’s subjects say that Trump may react to negative pressure, especially for information leaks with damaging effects, explosively, by implicating their source of source.
This is how it happened at the end of February, when someone kindly gave the President a printed copy of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's website from GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Head of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the source of the White House's information sheet.
It doesn't matter if Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter due to an ambush, or that he didn't offer any specific evidence, or that he's also filed false charges in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to ask the underprivileged Walsh: “
Goldmacher added that at that time Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of White House Office Rob Porter-on tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents to reach Trumpin.
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he'll be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump's still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from the capital of the foreign country are not allowed to appear bitter.
A lot of foreigners go out in the city centre of Tallinn.
The ones that the evening paper was talking to, you admitted playing in the old town without permission of the city government.
The first time we found three street muskets near the Viru Gates who had taken the same many dogs with them.
It was clear to see that muzzles with rastages and loose clothes were the back-up workers to whom a shower would be used to be a cow.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the society played a story with a fun rhythm, while one man next to him was in juongler with three balls and the passers getting closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of his backbags and smoking his heart attack himself.
These three dogs were not allowed to interfere with the passing people.
Bob, who played with Noem and the balls, told me that they would kiss on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the Society’s performance was to collect the ticket money for a vessel flying to Finland on the same day.
The question is, were they asking permission to play music in the old town, to shake off Noem and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and most often be given permission for a month or something.
It doesn't make sense to pay for it, says Bob.
When we got back to Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and drove them away.
The company moved to the Viru Centre with the back bags and the dogs.
There were also three half young men on the river street, one of whom played violins, the other clarnet and the third had carried an electronic piano.
“ We are here to offer people entertainment to disseminate music and joy and to make money for fuel and living, ” explained Dro Pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi says they're aware that the city government's permission to perform must be available.
“ We don’t have it, ” he said, “we don’t have it, ” he said.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go somewhere else, but we have to try, “he added.
In July, Eesti Pank bought bonds for EUR 149 million in the framework of the public asset purchase programme of euro area central banks, the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank, Mr Hardo Hansson, has previously explained, in response to the question of the members of the Riigikogu, that the asset purchase plan of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank shall purchase bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases decreases the yield of lower-risk assets and motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, each central bank shall purchase bonds of its national government within the framework of a public bond purchase programme, without buying bonds from other countries.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make them so-called substitutes within the limits of the volume.
The replacement purchases shall also be carried out by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
In general, the Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, on confirmation by Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were acquired, but since June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering's bonds.
The Central Bank of Finland will purchase both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks as of June.
The travelers ignore the ditch and return to the millionaire districts.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have once again come into a rough contrast with the decisive migrants who have ignored the council's mined ditch to win back the outside of their wool.
The travelers have parked their 20 Haagsivies outside the wealthy millionaires, baptized near Solihull Street.
They've returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were thrown out of the corn, let themselves be disturbed by a ditch that was dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protective boundaries, poking its vehicles through the remaining parts of the vehicle that had been left on foot.
Solihull’s council has been shattered by madmen, saying that the council is useless in dealing with the problem.
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after their extraction from Bentley Hethis, where they threw the passers with stones.
The Council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were out of time, and now they're back.
They got here last night, probably even more today.
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long signs to protect its parks.
I live on the way to Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the council fee if the council can't even stop this kind of thing.
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: “This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these migrants leave, and there is already a new attack.
This time, the number has grown, and even the horse has been commemorated in the grassland.
He said: “We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp site in the country nearby the street of Streetsbrook, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The gathering of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them,
Weekend Festival is also visited among all others by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world peaks.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who have a three-day talk about the festival with full attention.
But he does realize that Pärnu has become the true performers of his field.
“In view of the level of artists that they have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute peak names of this music genre will be brought home - that often does not occur in our territory,” says the Minister of Culture.
But what festival do artists most talk about Sarah?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren, who came up last night.
After all, according to his record, all of us at some point have sprung their feet, ” he says.
But he'll bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian performers are also: starting with NO menu and they can be read throughout the series.
In fact, this well - known concentration of names is very high, ” he says.
Look at the video of the website longer!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the crisis hit by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software service to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to BMW’s chairman, the company believes that ‘ there are smarter options than driving restrictions’, referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a resuscitation.
European automotive manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be cancerogen and may cause asthma.
It also increases the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralize emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies, making the price of cars more competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under a thorough investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of being forced by powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem.
Enterprises are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, which were so quieted down the use of so-called fraud equipment, which allowed the exhaust gas display to be adapted to the regulations at the time of the test of the vehicle, but returned to normal driving conditions.
Several of the leaders of Volkswagen have been accused in the United States of America and others are under investigation in both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, former Head of the Department for Motor Development of the Audi was arrested.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from issue and can go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation involving Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audi of installing the system in order to circumvent the requirements of European exhaust emissions by extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The participation of the audio in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union’s flag will be bought for 20 000 euros for Estonian schools.

The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education, one flag costs 35 euros.
Journalist murder emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the week magazine Riodoce will normally meet on Wednesdays to review the plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, which are sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They say it's important to change their routines.
Two elders discuss which seems safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the top of the room:
They ask reporters every column names to provide evidence not needed, enough impressions and inner feelings.
The government or cartels are suspected of being hired by drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists as a whole, as a whole, as a whole, to make the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The vast majority of them, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, have been killed by at least seven journalists in seven states since the arrest of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 by at least 25,589 journalists after attacks and threats under national protection.
The last deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“ It is the worst mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist, ” wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is a deep feeling, although his presence can be sensed throughout the Fasade of Riodoce building, a great picture of the average finger hanging from Valdez with a letter “Trudness, ” and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear a T-shirt with his smiling glasses of face or a hat hat hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoid.
Although a separate public prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been prosecuted by the Data of the Media Protection Committee.
As in most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, journalists’ killers rarely get to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is even more dangerous now.
According to Ibarra, a meeting on security is not much use without the killer's data and justice.
“Very stupid to waste your time at this meeting, ” he says.
“As long as the reason is not known, all of you will be distrusted.
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state on May 15th in the morning.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him from the red Toyota Corola. He was forced to leave the car 12 times and he was shot 12 times.
The armed man drove out of Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
The rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, there is nothing more than silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release of the United States of America in January, Sinaloo has been one of the most bloody fighting forces in the country, because rivals are fighting for the execution of the power force.
No matter how many people are shot off on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the dead are well - decorated with double-hulled mausoleums, which are bigger than the homes of many living.
Let us not forget that the time of peace suggests that only one cartel is being led by valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers that his work involves, Riodoce is a co-founder and manager of Ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the enormous symphony that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing led to two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Guzman's sons, a noseman with Damascus Lopez, who competed and was on the warfront.
This piece of paper could have made the boys angry by the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they got to the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after the branch in another record of the same story was recorded in the newspaper.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas “was impossible to deal with the press without addressing the drug problem, ”
In time, the newspaper gathered about the well - known appearances of bold and honest, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish strong studies without fear of censorship and readers in a snowprint they could read about stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won its Latin American award for echoes.
In the same year, the Valdez Journalist Protection Committee (AKK) won an international press freedom prize for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He admitted that he was afraid.
“ I want to live on, ” he said, accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, he told the television on Rompevito TV that drug trafficking was a lifestyle in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on a task with the press office with another opportunity to play stupid.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on.
The Riodoce collective longs for Valdez, a joker who rose like a madrus, a friend who kindly shared his empathy and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to El Guayabo's bar across the street and always sat on the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal.
His death has also made them doubt how to do their job best and stay alive.
“They don’t like the rigidity of women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used for the transport of drugs.
“ These things were not to be touched, ” said Bojorquez.
Even in the best of times, the result is strong self - control and self - control.
Trust your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the brain can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier...
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply to the toxic composition of Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreros, or other states that are home to the profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is changing constantly.
In the space where Riodoce's employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; some days before it was revealed that only the nuances sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from the 40 - degree heat hidden in the tree.
The government assigned them to watch Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters considered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent policemen whose governor himself had been misgivingd.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountainous areas where control is in the hands of the de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition of this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former box legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant is a place of interest for both drug dealers and public authorities.
Reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant has been registered in the name of a politician who is part of the powerful institutional revolution industries (IRP), which dominated all policy levels over the last century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread duplication of cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incident in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was carrying El Chapo, escaped from military troops.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column to get information about the best sources of kidnapping.
“ We would have known what happened instead, ” said 46 - year - old Villarreal, whose kleenuke bodybuilding has served him a nickname called El Flaco.
“Now all communication channels have broken down with our sources, ”
Valdez's office has become a storage room for the blinds and the stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and something they never expected to be activated for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of others and headed to the local prosecutor's office next morning for a demonstration of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West of Michigan three days after the killing of Valdez.
According to the body burned down and officials, it's from DNA tests to her.
Journalists have become more pronounced across the country and criticise the expression “SOS press” as an organized protest for roads and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is in Washington trying to collect international support in Valdez's case to set up an international ground for justice.
The day after the death of Valdez, when he met the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused journalists of suffocating and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be directed elsewhere to reflect the government’s activities, worrying that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were \"limited\" by organised crime, fellow civil servants and society.
In his last book “Narco-time literature, ” he wrote that reporters not only kill drug gangs but also do so by the command of politicians and security forces who are in the field of organised crime.
In the last year, more than half of the journalists' attacks on police and public officials were attributed to the Media Channel Monitoring Group Articulo 19.
“In a man you will die because you are wanted to be silenced, ” said Ramirez.
Murders obviously have a bloody effect.
No one forgets the death of bloger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found with a letter that was probably signed by a cartel in Los Zetas: “I’m here because of my reports.
The computer keyboard and headphones were found next to his depressed head.
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of Miroslava Breach, their subscriber.
Others will continue as they did in the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their head was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke of the drug cartel, with a ledger, which you want from us.
Some journalists have left their country or even their country.
It's a gross decision.
In ancient times it is hard to find work, and they still have to hide streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes, they're being pursued, as was the case with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in one of Mexico's apartments three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who remain still and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, confesses that the drug dealer's record scares him.
“ Mehiko is on his way to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter, ” he said.
At a recent midnight, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat in front of the office and looted beer when all the phones started vibrating.
In the coastal deaf town in Maztalta, 19 people had been killed in the ceasefires between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to be escalated, as many of the messages left by the cartels found in the region.
On the same side of the road, the reporters put news on the Riodoc website using their mobile phone.
The first of the next day needed a change.
There was another fire exchange in the area.
Bojorquez's hide for the police officers in charge to see if they're guarded.
When they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the author of the newspaper, on which his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees carried out his tracks.
“ How could you even think of closing, ” said Bojorquez, “as the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report to the streets? ”
Dinosaur used protective color to prevent enemies
At first sight, it looks like a shape, though scary.
Scientists have now made public the first findings in relation to the established presence of the unbelievably smallpox size of the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as “the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs”.
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with his wishes was red brown color and his past had been a little bit of “circumstance. ”
The report published in Current Biology described the existence of “a better preserved male dinosaur that has ever been found, ” and “a single best dinosaur position in the world –
For Fossil, this is a new species of nodosaurus living in the middle of the critical age 110-112 million years ago.
This unbelievably good survival of open scientists, who describe it as “a really significant one, ”
According to the National Geographic magazine, this beautifier covered by wishes is the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millennium at the mines of Fort McMurray near North Albertas in Canada.
He caught something that did not recall the surrounding stone, and decided to examine more closely.
The revealed fossil was sent to Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was worked to dig an animal out of the 2500-pound land.
After all this hard work, the end result will now be ready to bring the public forward.
“If a little bit of eyes were to be cut off, it could almost be believed that he was sleeping, ” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, researcher at Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the existence is exhibited.
“This is going to be one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs in the scientific community, Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
As he studied his skin, scientists found that this pest of plants, though covered with pretzels and resembled a walking tank, was likely to have a significant risk to the meaty dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used a red and white colour of protection to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique called resistance, which is also used by many animals today.
According to the experts, dinosaurs were better able to suffocate and prevent enemies, as major dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old family of nodosaurs reached the news for the first time in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied and named it by Boreaopelle Markmichelli Museum Laboratory Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing survival of the male, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the male body.
They discovered the threat - the protection method spread in the animal state, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the threat is widespread, the inventions come as a surprise, as Borealope is much greater than the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaurs were actively chasing other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of the resistance to survival.
However, most animals using today’s resistance, such as deer, sebras or armadils, are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
“ The powerful hunting of a large and large-bodied dinosaur shows how dangerous they could have been from the dinosaurs of the critical age, ” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the male organic compounds also revealed that dinosaur skin was red pepper.
Scientists will continue to study the animal in order to get clues about its life, including the preserved content of the intestine, to find out what the animal ate his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell in the dead river, thereby reaching the sea with flow, where he had a whirlwind in front of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida and the rivers and oceans were likely to go far beyond the inner world as it is now.
“This nodosaur is truly significant, as it is fully covered with the skin that has been preserved, but it remains three-dimensional while maintaining the original shape of the animal, ” Brown said.
“ As a result, animals today look almost the same as in critical times.
In order to reconstruct it, there is no need to use much imagination, just to tear your eyes apart, and it seems like she sleeps.
The critical age was the time when the vast two legs of the carnivorous dinosaurs - teropods were floating on Earth.
Although the rex of all the king of Tyrannosaurus lived millions of years later than Borealope, it could have been hunted by some of his scary predecessors.
They include Accrocanthosaurus, 38 ft (11,5 m) a long and six-tonne-weight monster.
Scientists whose recent inventions have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealope was threatened after death in the sea and that mumifice in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk, when he mined the Millennial mine near Fort McMurray in North Albertas in Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world, including skin and armor, and it is complete from cone to hips.
These characteristics were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of a slave came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this warm-floored plant eater was going through the present West Canada until the flooded river threatened to open it.
However, the dinosaur seabed site helped to preserve its appeals in an excellent way.
The stoned remains of this particular male are so well preserved that the head bones of the carcases of the carcase are still covering the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “The same degree of survival is as rare as the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The remains of the stoned skin continue to cover mygaric musculoskeletal plates on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg is lying next to him, and five toes are stretched up.
I have the opportunity to read his wishes.
How one activist found the answer to the question:
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident, Airbnb, was in a rented room on the bed by turning on the Facebook phone.
He got into the mail of his former fellow schoolmate.
It said: “Polts had just killed a 18 - year - old kid, and he still lays down on the street, ”
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The image @TheePharoah user's posts were repeatedly distributed on his timeline.
In real time, the rapper from St. Louis's region sent a signal about Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street staying there for four hours.
“ This is crazy, ” Ferrell thought about himself.
But death was nothing new for him or for his community.
He hung up his phone, but later last night he saw another tone that reported that people were gathering at Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, and still kept a note, \"Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son. \"
He was looking at a real-time stream where the police stood in front of a group of protestors with a dead dog.
In the second video, another officer, he said, “I will kill you all... animals, ” said the gun and scream.
Ferrell recalls how he found himself thinking: “This is unusual.
“This is not the murder of the kind we are used to, and what we could call typical, ”
At that moment, I felt a sense of fear.
I was angry and crying,
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
When he landed at 23 p.m., he went to his father after his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning two of the two of you ingreed.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Fernando is the central theme in the new documentary, “Whose Streets, whose streets? ” which is premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and loss, strength and perseverance of people who live in this community and who fulfilled the answers to the demands of the streets.
When Ferrell, along with his daughter - who had a flowery dress on her back and had a nice crown - headed for Ferguson, they had again discussed the subject that had been discussed several times before this morning - black people's experiences and living conditions.
“ Do you remember how I taught you how to fight for your rights, ” she recalls.
\"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right. \"
“ I couldn’t take him with me, ” Ferrell later said.
“What is happening now is... the cornerstone of the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activistism and organisation, and at the same time feel different layers of black people's experience and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free.
Even if I can raise him so that he does not experience personalised racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a bear if I protected him from this world...
The first stop they did when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florida's way to a station across the police station that had received a certain kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put together food bags and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrelli, the shape of a new type of activity began slowly.
“My activity changed completely after 9 August, ” she said, stating that when she was a student at the University of Mission-St. Louis, she was president of the Minorities Association and focused on food education and health inequalities in black-haired communities.
“I had no experience in organising.
It was all just a tear.
A week later, Ferrell met with the co-chairman of one of the films, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and his film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
The question came up in the mind of Ferrelli: “Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be used to:
Such skepticism was caused by an countless number of cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to reap its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in the recent interview: “We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard, and we wanted to do so differently, ”
Folayan had already hit his hands with the co-responsor Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activistism in connection with the convicted prisoners.
His involvement changed the project for Ferrell, and for six other locals, who were watching the film “Whose Streets, ” the team after Brown was shot for years.
“ No one speaks for us or for us in this documentary, but we speak ourselves, ” said Davis.
“ For me, it was important for me to be portrayed by these people, because this is what I am, ”
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, it should be shown that the movement is not “in the lead of the donor, but in the assembly of the community, ” as Folayan said, was made by the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Whose Streets” describes a surprising personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
“ I felt like I was naked, ” Ferrell said, laughing at the first time when he was ready to see the linen.
“But I realized that this work and the humanisation of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability, ”
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights and re-establishs the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three beginners of the movement, who in social media in 2012 thought out the themes #BlackLivesMatter, after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, is homosexual.
“In its role, black homosexual women have generally kept moving, ” Ferrell said, “and that is precisely because we have to keep fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden:
Folayan agreed, stating that “the movement is indeed a life of black women, and many of them are black homosexual women, ”
At the same time, he claims that ‘it is not a type of equal opportunity to create.’ Ferrelli did not choose the film as the center point because of his identity.
“ He was a man who had the right energy, ” he said.
“But it is not a coincidence that it was located directly on the front line, as a black homosexual woman living in such nodes has a great deal of weight.
His energy can be sensed through the screen.
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long been lost, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the demonstration to Ferrell, the sentence for blocking the road will last for another 2,5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, simply “the ‘buffer’.
However, he still considers it important for him to eat a mantra from the time he went all three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
“Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
7 tips on how to get over from the Northeast after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest male boys find the party after the day-to-day, which is also helpful.
Or they're based on the words \"out of the bow, still drunk,\"
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent pain in health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and to get over as painless as possible after today and tomorrow's Weekend tram or other parties?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of liquids while drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
With water, mineral substances are also evaporated out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach has often become irritant, it is especially good if it is free of bubble or just slightly gasted.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you wouldn't pay a hangover to break trees to Grandma's wife, which could prove a fatal lie.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Landing in the tent and deporting the North is a more time-consuming way of planning.
Put the energy back on the body slowly and gently.
If you're up to something wrong with last night's overrun, I'm sure it's not worth trying to load a big fat steak.
Start with, for example, fresh juice containing fruit sugars in your body which are quietly placed on the market.
If the health of the South is already suffering, you might want to try a sweater, for example.
And a little later on the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretics will release your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on pain pills.
If you take a pain relief to prevent the hangover tonight, your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen as well as your liver.
So you're ruining your liver even more and you're gonna get worse.
In addition, the pain relief will not remain in the body for a long time.
If you take a pain medication in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach, it'll piss you off.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It affects about the same way as walking, but walking can't get orgasm.
However, avoiding the too active pace and the crazy poses - at the time of the film - the physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Why don't you talk to your friends and friends, make simple fools, and smile friendlyly both yourself and others (ports).
The joke and the laugh may not be a fool, but it's definitely more fun to bear the consequences.
Once in a while, you're going over your head anyway!
Professor Northwestern and employee of Oxford University are being sought as suspects in murder.
According to the police, the professor of Northwestern University and the employee of Oxford University are wanted nationwide, who have become suspects after finding the dead man's body from one Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County's case documents, arrest orders were issued on Monday without bail-in order for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of first-level murder due to their alleged link with Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated injection.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The police got a phone call and found a victim on his way to the Grand Plaza apartment building with several throats on his body.
According to the authorities, the Cornell-Duranleau scene was recognised as dead and the investigators are about to be stabbed as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiological and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University's Public Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the cities of Northwestern University.
“This is now the case with the competent authorities for the investigation of criminal matters, and the University of Northwestern cooperates with the investigators, ” said Cubbage.
Warren is an elder massist at Oxford University's financial department.
The representative of the University and the College of Somerville said in an e-mail declaration: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist U.S. research institutes in every way possible.
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues had been shocked and wished him to give himself up.
The Chicago Police Department's Head of Communication Division, Anthony Gugliemi, strongly recommends that the suspects give themselves to the authorities.
“The parties have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly involved in defining the exact location, ” said Gugliem.
According to Gugliel, suspects are helping to look for both local, regional and national authorities.
Gugliel said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a crypt hint that there was something going on in apartment number 1008.
According to the police reports, it was a magical sight.
It is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship, ” added Gugliel.
The Grand Plaza Management wrote to the people: “The parties are currently working with the explanation of the chronology of events and the background of the victim and explores various motives, including the possibility of family life.
Businesses that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce start-up company, but the interviews were ineffective.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymousness, some workers did not trust this process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective, ” said Madison Reed.
So he invited outside people to help.
New types of human resources are focused on start-ups that help companies figure out what their employees know.
The development and licensing of software, which is designed to measure employee involvement, enable companies to make sudden interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymism and complaint hotline, and in some cases allow speakers to pass the C-level managers and direct access to the board.
“Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitzbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where Fitbit is your company, Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City's start-up company Glint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to this, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel in three years when he has used Glint.
In addition to surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a company's heat map, which provides an overview of the most complaints in the departments and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they must remain aware of their working culture so that they do not become the next Uber, which has been rebelled at scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the pious environment where they were punished for those who dared to speak.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area may be more than USD 118.7 billion according to the data of the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments by 2020.
In Denver Colorado, a start-up company in Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, noted this year Uber’s suspicious reputation in the background of interest and increased activity.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized pulse interviews, collect confidential answers in real time and watch heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous communication line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And if the CEO is involved, the complaints will go directly to the board.
“The choice of opinion has prompted the regulatory authorities, ” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that, if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or does not act in an ethical way, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee leaving and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has spent more than a year in order to ensure staff's awareness of the rules and operations and offer an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the telephone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, submit an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a depressing and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
Now that the company uses Convert, however, there are potential problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not previously reach leaders in other cities or offices in states, faster identification and handling.
“I have a chance to get closer to the holocaust 360-rate experience of my employees, ” said Vitrano, who is in charge of Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
\"And we will protect our shareholders from the trial with employees:
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after Arthur Andersen fell into line with Enron's scandal due to ethical violations.
But only when “social media became mature, ” companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from washing up in the public web.
“In order to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy, ” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and the possibility of approving venture capital investors that have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent was financed by companies such as Sappshire Ventures and Tola Capital by raising the capital raised to a value of 47 million dollars.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the total company’s contribution to $60 million.
Such investments will not be as a surprise when taking into account the relationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
There are always more studies to show that today’s workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects have just the stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel accepted and appreciated and devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are heard and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the company’s success, ” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the Department of General Benefits and Workers’ Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glinti.
Investors earn income if companies in their portfolio are doing well; businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If analytical tools allow the third party to increase employees' commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will be supported.
The inclusion of workers is, according to the experts in the working culture, important.
But these data are useless if the company's supervisors don't do anything with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it may be expected that the changes will be awaited.
And if the changes do not take place quickly or at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“If you ask 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen companies make mistakes by relying on too much data collection.
“If things do not come to an end, then the workers will think: ‘ Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why would I care?
According to this report, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly studies among employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed in the speed of decision-making and in the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays will collect new data on workers and it is expected that in the long term it will contribute to the long-term employee commitment industry, which is known for the flow of its large workforce.
“If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people, ” said Vitrano.
\"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies –
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic countries, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the European Central Bank's report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic production per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
There is a low debt burden, a rapid improvement in institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
“Baltic countries, in one of Slovakia’s few euro area countries, where real GDP per capita has been significantly closer to the EU average, the central bank reported.
Although the aim is that total economic output per capita would be more profitable for Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita represented only 2/3 of 15 countries, which belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer study, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania’s population estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was considered to be slightly less than half of those surveyed on its own economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice a day will make Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 a.m. when the trobik UCLA footballers stop talking at the edge of the new training field in the team campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirt by exposing their training camp's first day of effort to sweat its back.
For a large part of the team, these power-emitters are offering a midday break.
Players participating in summer courses go back to the gym after three hours to study for finals before returning to Wasserman Football Centre next morning at 6.30 p.m.
“ The next three days are a real test for them, ” said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel the players’ loads takes place twice a day, has actually made their days longer - at least until the final tests were reached on Fridays.
For this reason, UCLA was the first three training sessions scheduled to begin at 19.15 in order to match players in the ever tight schedule.
The transition from two trainings a day means more than one training day - The start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week in advance compared to the previous season, and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons, the training took place during summer courses.
They will have 18 sessions until 20 August before the official preparation of the opening game against Texas A&M will take place in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA Regulation change, although this adds another item on the agenda to the player's tight schedule.
“They have a tremendous burden on three or four days, and it is a serious challenge, ” said Mora.
“And they will break through this trial; they will make a effort, they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.
When the camp is over, UCLA training is closed, which is not a simple task, given the clear view of these fields near the parking lot and the adjacent Luskin center, the higher class of a hotel that has already been hit by footballs from the gatepost surrounding the network.
Since this weekend, the players at the Bruins Hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
\"We're building security,\" said Mora.
“This is a real concern and it is not excessive to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use security at parking lot and 8th.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We've got a plan in place.
In order to pay the fee for the union of election of Savisaare-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE, who was born to the Central District, are forced to leave the Reformed District to join the forces of Maria Kaljuste, to show the hopeful election union of businessmen Tegus Tallinn - appears to be taking part in local elections this year at least as many political parties.
However, chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key issue is whether there are sufficiently disappointed voters for them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the small population of Edgar Savisaare has diminished, the events that have been organised to the honour of his election union may not be.
One member of the Riigikogu, some of the former and present Central Poles and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And why do some of the faithful followers and friends of Savisaare stand aside from applying in Tallinn, looking for a list of followers of the Savisaare, whose front is corrupt and suspected of corruption crimes?
Music video filmed on the roof of the city hall for a Russian pop song involving the oldest part of Lasnamäe; and, in every sense, the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to avoid the voices of the 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed for the first time by the Central District for the first time?
We look forward to the perception of other political parties of a youthful election campaign.
If the Channel 2 or TV3 viewers look at the black square from the beginning of August to the beginning of the entertainment show, there will be two options: agree that in future only the ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be released or handed over to some television operators every month.
There are probably also those who initially rejoice publicly over advertising-free television experience, but at the end of the day - although reluctant - pay for television and advertising.
The dazzling music, a loud people, and the trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
However, if you do not want to share the noise, it is worth leaving home to the festival guests for the amount of the noise to be found in your head instead of the pain of your head.
Washington is changing the rules of the Green Card
Media fields are quoted by President Donald Trump, who says that there is a new US immigration plan that changes the rules on the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, more stringent rules for the acquisition of temporary forms of work and restrictions on family orientation with regard to visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill goes to the discussion of Congress in two Chambers.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money, as it changes the way in which green cards are issued to citizens of other US countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will provide an advantage to candidates who speak English and have funds to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy,” said Trump in the United States of America’s media publications.
The Siber Set young people move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous gold miners of the former Maana River.
He works at home 140 kilometers away from the Maya additional river in Kuoi as the driver of the gold satellite.
It's tough work: two months of work without holiday days for 12 hours and then only ten days at home and again.
In the three years worked at Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
“There is a hard time at that: when you go in, you will be thoroughly checked not to bring the wine, and when you go out to avoid taking the gold, ” says Anatoli.
Mare Piho, talking to the local Seto Jan in Haida, who has told him much about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian setos will also affect the home-sets, because it is simply so amazing, thinks the most far-reachingly far-reaching set researched by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia will be 30 years this year.
In that time, he's been there 14 times and he's been there for a year.
How many went to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century to land here?
That's an unsolvable question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I've taken it out according to the Siber Set of Men who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say exactly, because at that time, up to 30 people could come in a group, but only a pass was given to a man.
The passport was given only to one, but he had children, sisters and other women.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was a number of times bigger than the historical state of Setoma.
It was a training exercise, a way to manage it.
Set came here as peasants, but their life changed because here they came into areas that were not only linked to agriculture, but also to the river (wage hunting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peter, many sites later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojärsk-45 (in this way, the Soviet power was built by the uranium plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the pigs then represent most of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multilinguality remained long.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much did the culture of the Siberian Seto differ and differ from those of the Motherland Seto?
They're different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did so themselves (nationalists), but they always made the difference that was brought along and that was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of setos, because it's colder here.
Food changes.
For example, in Setoma, meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Seto and what life is there for? / graph: Alari Paluots
The communication with the motherland was spiritually strong, and it was considered very important.
I think now it's going to give back to Setumaa, it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
Pho means the people of the Estonian seto delegation who came to Haida village in Seto on the day of July and lived four days in homes - J. P.
What's still here is amazing.
“It is extremely easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: at a railway point and at a crossroads, ” says Reigo Tamm from the Operaist.
The city is no longer a mere military city, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture places, and the pizza gets everywhere.
The way is the top-top town!
There's a small island out of the city along the river River White, where killers like to have a Japanese party.
“This beautiful place does not look like a train window,” says Reigo.
Who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, you're gonna be fine!
In the river River, you can keep a picnic and just make a romance - you can look at the river and think ahead and back.
I've been there walking with my girlfriends.
The Operaist Tamm has been on the river side with three bridges to practice his gardens: “For this place is at the city’s side, no one may resist when their stories come to pass.
“A wonderful view opens up on Tape, but there are also health tracks where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, the discgolf play - the golf course is done, the chains can be borrowed from the sports centre,” Reigo chairs.
The old pros, of course, go with their chains, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
We must probably invite my colleague Rasmus Kull Tape to visit, because he has experienced a disco player and has disks.
I don't think he's gonna borrow me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were now an integral part of the childhood of operasolist.
Less during the kisses.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you will win my sports life.
Not to mention broken coils and kisses.
“The central city is now full of construction work, all of which becomes unknown, ” says Reigo.
Kill the old and tired vasal building, however, is a very attractive place to play in summer performances.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M.M.M.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and that his theatre had to make a solid summer theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season, Aleksei Karenin, was just over, on 11 August there is an increase in the railway station, when the old valet building moves around in the 1980s.
“ Until 11-13 August, the days of the city of Tapa, in which the open home cafés and cultural events, including the public rally, have been awakened, will speak to Reigo, who will recommend that these days visit the city from 91 years.
In a small, yellow house, on May 1, 1994, the museum has been present.
“The house is small, but the exhibit is very much and the information is enormously appreciated by Reigo, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo's making sure that if Tapa's going through all the proposed places, the stomach will be empty long enough, but fortunately, the little town's full of cafes.
“ We have such good meals and coffee shops, ” she explains, “and sometimes you feel abroad.
Trained and young Men of Tape spend a lot of time in pubes-coffees, which is why sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but this is an international society together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal execution in Greece
TV bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal execution in Greece.
On August 1st, the police arrested the illegal executioners of the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but now there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already putting in place rough slaughters for anyone who is caught by rest in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to break sheep.
After one year, the farmers of Hiiumaa must return to wolves from their her herd “training material, ” perhaps the wolves who taught dogs have already broken a number of sheep.
This year the wolves in Hiiu county have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and have injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
I had only three numbers, 124 a year earlier.
There are also data from the environmental agency in the symphony with the fractures that the soil of the Hiiumaal wolves were not born and the data of the Hiiumaaan hunting council that this year has fixed two wolf cats on the island.
The night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village in Emmaste, and injured 18 of the surviving sheep.
At the early morning of the Wednesday, wolves broke a sheep in the village of Reheselja and seriously injured the other one who had to be killed.
The rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law amending the genetically modified organisms law (GMOVS) and the plant protection law.
The amendment of the Act abandons the creation of a separate set of data set for both genetically modified (GM) sites and operators, which will continue to be used in the plant health register.
Furthermore, the obligation of the GM farmer to have a prior agreement with apiculture operator in the specified radius is amended.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the composition of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonia free of GMOs, said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
\"It must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and the administrative burden for the private and public sectors, in Annex Suu.
The draft legislation repeals the provisions relating to the collection and management training of sites and operators of agricultural crops in the GMOVS, lays down requirements for the management of GM crops and the start-up of economic activities.
In particular, in connection with beekeeping, the obligation of the GM farmer to inform mesinics of the start of the crop-growing obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee before the start of cultivation.
The draft law was sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine the draft information system and, if they so wish, to give their opinion to the Ministry of Agriculture.
The proposed changes will affect, in particular, persons active in the field of plant cultivation, bees and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - MON 810.
Until then, however, no Estonian farmer is interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no maize disaster in Estonia, a European varreet, for which maize MON 810 is resistant.
Its varieties of maize have also been developed for southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Life has commissioned studies to detect potential GM pollution in different summer rapes, corn and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples carried out showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia, genetically modified crops are not knowingly grown and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruit Nemanja Matic in the form of \"genius\"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited Nemanya Maticu in the face of \"genius\", after the middle player made Sammdor against Wednesday night his debut.
For 40 million pounds of Chelsea, a player purchased from Chelsea began in Dublin in the last seasonal game in the United before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday in the original series of 2-1 winnings, impressing the defense industry, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on assaults.
However, after leaving the Blues season-time Asian tour, Macticul was in need of a match form and only held 45 minutes, and Mourinho said that he had to improve it before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking, he has a football mood, ” said Mourinho.
\"We help him achieve the form as soon as possible:
As Mattic, at the Aviva Stadium, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began to set up one of their first men for the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still want to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club had already done a \"great job\" by concluding agreements with three of its four priority options.
“ I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four, ” he added.
“ I’m even happier when they can make four out of four, but they have worked hard for me, ”
Another vasculinator got his leg on August 1st of the GSM transmitter and so on Muhus.
According to Matti Martinson, the lively bird watcher of the Sõrves, the first son-in-law, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined a large sleeper of Mullutu-Surlah.
This is because the Sõrves is not a crop fire, says Saarte Häll.
On this Tuesday, it's relatively late to ring the throats, another deaf boy got on the escort and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project that Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste carry.
The bubble was equipped with a deaf son named Matti GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türky.
“He’s doings on the Internet are all looking at: how he went to winter in Spain, coming back for a while at the German border with Poland, and then came to Sarah’s country,” Martinson said.
The British inventor had to install a microchip in his own body in order to get into the house and the car with a handbrake.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which the microchip was installed, so that he could open his front with a hand clip only, get into the office and even start the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had to install a small chip between his thumb and the name ring and now offer this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has connected forces to the royal hospital consultant at the Hampshire province of Winchester with Dr. Geoff Watson to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and only 30 seconds is needed for the procedure.
Northam's company will also change the locks of houses and cars so they can fit in with a chip, asking for a number of 300 pounds.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit went to pay the taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published in TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an American production event was worth $24,000 for the southern court taxpayers.
The Green and White Color Sikorsky VH-3D, which is called Marine One during the President's on-board, was the central attraction of the American construction programme event held in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and High officials from the White House renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with hunting from Maine, fire truck from Wisconsin and fork lifts made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the escort responsible for helicopter operations required the presence of the White House’s military cabin to be part of the helicopter’s command, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter’s “unusual” event was landed in the southern courtyard.
“I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually significant event, ” said HMX-1 commander day before the event in e-mail to your boss, Deputy Officer of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter will arrive at the southern court on 17 July at 7 a.m. at 15 a.m. and will remain there until the yard is clean between 18 a.m. and 21 a.m.
The fact that if leaving the White House was to be delayed was added is necessary because of the limitations of working time for the return of another echipaa.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the Eskader security team remained near the aircraft for the entire period of its presence on the ground.
It was not possible to find out whether or not the other echipaaja finally needed it.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could breach this provision.
“We asked if it would violate the Hatchi law, and we were told not to break it, ” wrote the commander.
“It seems that you do not have a choice, ” replied Deputy Officer.
The White House declared the event, made in America, to be an official event, and the Hatchi law would not have covered it.
But even on official events there are political subsonics.
The president then supported the efforts of the health reform at the meeting in the Senate and welcomed the efforts of the government to keep its regulations in line.
The name Marine One or Air Force One-known aircraft use for politically profitable purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump observed in February when, at his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, a president's plane ran into a background, and he's got Twitter's account hanging from messages that complain about how he used his predecessor's president's plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the proposal, “made in America, ” said Lindsay Walters, the White House Pressor, representing products from all 50 states that have been manufactured by American workers from American materials.
The HMX-1 teams often do a test flight around Washington and on the south side of the yard to train the release to the President of the United States of America with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 White House held 58 sampling landings.
According to the official, the flight was thought to be an event, made in America, as a standard for study flights of the flight crew for that month.
In addition to that day, Esacader helicopters flew 11 hours for non-presidant support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event carried out in the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of an exhibition on the southern side of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the President's budget documents and the exact costs of the event it is difficult to identify.
But according to the cost of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, VH-3D is EUR 24 380 per flight hour.
The Esacator's documents indicated that the flight was a long flight from its base to the Navy Quantico airport in Virginia for 30 minutes.
White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is far below that amount.
“The calculation of the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
‘These estimates of compensation include staff, maintenance and much other irreversible costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations:
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
The former press editor of the White House Sean Spicer was protecting the helicopter at that time.
“The point is to show things made in America this week, ” said Spencer.
“And I know that the State of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are expected hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this:
It's not clear whether Trump was involved in a helicopter meeting in the south-west street, or not, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives, making fun of the company’s products in his private aircraft park.
“I know Sikorsky very well, ” said the President, “I have three of their products:
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, Daegus Daegus hit Šadekot in the last area, 800 m ran into a footstorm and was taken off the stadium with a drop in the carrier frame.
Immediately before that, he had received a distance jump to zero on the Chinese state-of-the-art universe.
In 2012, the Helsinki EMM violated the injury suffered in the cheap, but at the debutytourism held in London, he received a point 23 at 6013.
However, the misfortune continued.
After the opening day, Moscow World 2013 had been the Estonian record schedule for the distance jumper.
Two years later, he got to Beijing MM in 15th place and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but that was more likely to disappoint the athlete.
The toughest kadalpu passed the soil of Šadeko, unless, at the beginning of Amsterdam, the EM was able to record the result of the distance leap.
I'd just like to put together one decent multi-competition once.
One time, Sheadeko.
The worst was before: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was cut off as early as the first break.
Time to take off - Do you want to continue with the seven competitions?
Is the two-day effort worth all of this?
She thought long, but she found peace in herself.
I've got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think straight.
“ I knew I wasn’t putting the pill in the bag yet, ” says Shadako about self - cleaning.
I was able to turn the whole sheet and move on in a new way.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the caretaker's suffering, but he realized that, in particular, the athlete must find out himself.
He was so matered off by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“ Grit said, ‘ He will not give up, and he will prove to himself what he deserves, ’ says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He'll make it his pleasure.
The contest came back in May when Šadeko erected the 6280 points of the new Estonian record at the Götzian multi competition.
At a high-level competition, he improved his personal top-market with nearly a meter (13.89) and ran a record-to-date time barrier.
Then the multi-player felt that it was not a set of abilities, but that it had been erased was a first-round contest.
Mägi, who's been coaching him for years, says that Sheadeko is a master student.
He's a sportsman, he's good at training.
If something goes wrong or it's wrong, he's gonna say it right now.
He knows his own body and trusts his knowledge.
That's what we need to follow.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Šadeko.
“I’m not the one doing the maximum practice, ” he says, “and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The close bee spirit makes you happy
Good emotions have also served close happiness to Shaadeko.
Both his former training companion Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-player has received support from new air citizens.
“ It’s been interesting, ” says Shaadeko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to brain-tressing.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is a great wine fan in his mouth, that he believes - wine can train his brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather “very active ” in the process of tasteing wine.
By snoring the glass, waving the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and percepting the aftermath, we put our brain into work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperdi, wine molecules don't really contain taste, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain looks, the colors.
“ The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the taste of wine, ” says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, makes sure the wine isn't full of wine.
“ There must be more to function, ” he says.
If you're taking too big a blow, the system's overrun.
The excessive drinking of wine can damage the brain instead of benefit - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental ability.

According to the United Nations, the role of Afghan democracy in politics depends on women's role.
The Head of UN Afghanistan mission said on Wednesday that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play their role.
The United Nations Head of Mission Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three women are candidates for Vice-Presidents and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.

A wide world from the Philippines, or Õlgkot, to the heart of the fashion fans
The bags are a summer classic, which in recent years has become its own hit product, which one true souvenirer has to hang at the end of his hand, and which has been known by the traders, regardless of its modest origin, to be boiled with a price bridge corresponding to the hit.
The bag that has been bitten from the shoulders is probably one of those things that has existed in every single life and that has not caused any particular emotions.
It's just there, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the straw bags have made a real victory and the fashionists have replaced their fine designer bags for summer months, rather than the simple-headed bags.
It's not just a beach bag, it's also popular today as a street bag, and it's even for the bravest women to walk into the office.
However, it is worth making it clear before making it clear whether such a summer line still sits or it pays for the wetland and the laptop to be put in a slightly more formal fog.
However, delusionality has made the women's true love for their women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to do is to see that the Moegurmans, as the first thing to go on holiday trips to the local market and buy some straw bags for which the whole holiday season is true and which comes along with the beach, the market, and the friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand among the readers is so high that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to each other to become a happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because few of these procedures are possible if some of the things that have arisen into the fashion world can be bought for only a fewty euros.
True, plank traders have also discovered a simple opportunity to provide money and thus sell finer luxury brands for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably to keep the richer customers from feeling like one of those cheap bags.
For example, you can buy Dolce & Gabba a handbag that pays more than a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag can be found at EUR 6000.
Unlike most fashioners, the shoulder bags are not derived from some great fashion, but they began far further.
It is said that the straw bags come from far from the Philippines, where they have been carried wide.
There is especially an exorcism and local around them very often not to be seen.
It's allegedly from the 14th century of pollen and it's pretty sad with a normal cortex.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be as hard as a basket, the pattern and other materials that make the bag more personal and more attractive.
For example, in recent times there are particularly trendy bags with coloured blades or leather strips.
However, thank-yous can send in first and foremost to actress Jane Birkin, who had never been seen before.
In fact, he suited the shoulder bag with all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
At the popularity of bags today, however, it does not play a smaller role, but it is also that taking care of them is a dumpster and, unlike all other Sumadans, they do not need to be maintained by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trend cuts, apart from the classic appearance, the brands have come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you want, you can buy yourself a rib or a little shoulder.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes from fashion to shoulder.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of straws that resembles a basket from its style has been considered classic, open and short, as well as straws, sands.

A man who disappeared three days ago on the island was found.
On Wednesday night, Aare left his home in Kärla's suburbs, an unknown direction.

His phone was then empty, and the location of the man was therefore no longer possible.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The Agency is waiting for the cookie manufacturer McVitie's managers to confirm the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future investment of Tollcross.
The factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products works for more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner in Pladis said they've invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
There workers were hired and trade union presidents “are the first to hear, ” if anything changes in the factory’s activities.
By letter sent to the company’s object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie’s company “to give up concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines –
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot find out from the head director of the object about Tollcross’s business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been families of several generations and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people around Glasgow, with the necessary support to ensure proper employment in a region with high unemployment and social loss.
As a result, Glassgow needs the East from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being, as well as Brexiti, the increase in living costs and the growth in production from McVitie's –
The representative of the Pladis said: “The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company is directly responding to it because we value an active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are looking at our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in Tollcross, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as the legacy of the production object, and if there is any change in its activities, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear it.
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in trying to lure Neymar into his lines by offering him an offer of 189 million pounds to buy out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest trip?
This gross approach has opened a summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the world record of over doubles, which was erected during the previous season by Paul Pongba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymarist will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world who will start to get paid by PSG over 500 000 pounds per week.
Barcelona is, of course, angry because of the approach and the break-out of Neymar, although the close source of Catalans confirms that the club has always been the best care in 2013 for a football player since its arrival in Santos.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all clubs who thought about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll go up against them and contact their players, ” said Al-Kheliafi.
\"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to conclude a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences, “
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in the PSG central player Marco Verratt.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian Republic to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could have a return hit as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
“Brexy threatens to seriously hit the race between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland, ” warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“ I can’t imagine who would benefit from it, ” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to move the current free movement of people and goods, said Varadkar.
“This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders, ” he stressed.
According to the thief, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union and, as it cannot be done, to remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's exit smoother would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Commenting on the existence of such an agreement with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could have such an agreement with Great Britain.
An alternative would be to return to customs points that would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
“To trade, prosperity and peace, ” said Irish Prime Minister.
He referred to Brexit as a challenge of our generation and warned that this result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
