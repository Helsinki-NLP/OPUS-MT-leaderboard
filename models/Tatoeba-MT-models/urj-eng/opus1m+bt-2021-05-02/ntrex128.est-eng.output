Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to look like Muppets
Some of the members of the National Assembly have worked hard to make their appointments known as MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun to turn the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
The representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly of the Laborists said that his groupmates are concerned because it is gloomy with the words ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
To explain to readers outside Wales: the word daft in gypsy means napka and pwp means cocoa.
A member of the planet said that the group as a whole was not happy, and has offered other names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his group was “responsibly sensitive to change of name, ” but noted that the word ‘MWP’ was very similar to ‘Muppet’.
To explain: in the dark language, the star w vote is similar to that of the English language of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft law on the amendment of the name, said: “The decision on all the names of the National Assembly members will, of course, be taken by its members.
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public poll on proposals relating to the name, on the basis of which the idea is widely supported to refer the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘Wales Parliamentary Members, WMPs,’ but public poll participants in favour of the most possible option ‘MWP’.
The members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should present a bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform act also covers other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the comitology system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly will remain in the debate of the Members.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether or not to refer to their country as “the Republic of South Macedonia”
The referendum will be held with a view to resolving the dispute with Greece, which has its own province in Macedonia for decades.
Athens has long argued that its name for the North-Eastern Group represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President, Mr Ivanov, against the referendum on name change, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the referees, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the change in name is only a price paid by the State for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's bells are silent because the Church of Harlem is struggling in trouble
“The number of people I've been talking to has said that there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” said Mr Adams.
\"Never is more than
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
“ People today communicate differently, ” he said.
“Bars no longer live in neighbourhoods where people are present every day, ”
However, as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that money from selling assets will not last for as long as the leaders hope, and “the sooner or later they will be back at the beginning, ”
Adams added that churches can be replaced with housing houses full of people who do not pass the hand of the remaining churches in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority who buy apartments in these buildings are white, ” he added, “who therefore accelerates the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of their churches, ”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlemist became a black methropol . Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the St. Martin Church ten years later.
The original White Methodists congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, who had worshiped God nearby, took over the property of the building.
The church of St. Martin, the African-American congregation, with the Prime Minister John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against the 125th Street shoppers on Harlem, when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the fire was severely damaged, but when the members of the Father Johnson congregation planned to restore the building, they introduced a carill, or a watch game.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's church, Reverend David Johnson named carillion with pride “for the bells of the poor. ”
However, another name was given by an expert who played a carion in Junus: ‘cultural value’ and ‘inopportunity’.
The expert from Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world's first carion played by a black musician, Dionio A. Lind, who continued to play a bigger carion in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriweather said that the St. Martin Church did not replace him.
In recent months, the church of St. Martin has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by secular leaders, other bishops.
In July, the head of the congregation, which was composed of secular leaders, was in writing to the bishop, who said that the bishop “is trying to pass on the costs, ” although the president was not even involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the acts of the bishop.
In California, the shark was injured by a boy dived after 13-year-old lobsters.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into California for lobsters on the opening day.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego to KSWB-TV that he had been with friends about a half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy's help and then swimd over to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought that the boy expressed his interest in receiving the lobster, but “You must understand that the boy was screaming, ‘ You know, I was bitten!
I was bitten.
Her entire punishment was revealed, and Hammel described the vision that she saw when she reached the boy.
“ I told everyone that they would come out of the water: ‘ There is shark in them, ” added Hammel.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken on a plane to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego.
The type of shark attacked is not yet known.
At the press conference, the rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that this was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablanca to Swaziland.
Giles added that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered hazardous.
Sainsbury plans to take over UK beauty products
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' chain, creating supermarket-like beauty products, where expert advisors also work.
As part of the significant impact on the UK’s 2,7 billion pounds of beauty market, which is still on the rise in sales of fashion and home goods, a wide range of beauty products across 11 shops is being tested, taking them successfully in other shops next year as well.
They invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the previously separated shelf space for televisions, microwave ovens and domestic goods.
Sainsbury's said that it plans to double the selection of its beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
For existing product choices from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, more space is also given to existing brands as is currently found in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also brings back to the market its series of makeup products Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is the only sales license in two Sainsbury's shops, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other one opened this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Buying in the website and buying small amounts of food daily from local food stores means that supermarkets have to try more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sasbury, Mike Coupe, has said that sales sites are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, since supermarket chains are trying to fight cheap sales chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury has put Argos in hundreds of stores, and the same has been done with Habitits sales, as Sainsbury has bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier attempt on the Supermarket to update its department of beauty and treatment products ended with failure.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a row on how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after the sale of his 281 son from the pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, a total sales chain of Lloyds Pharmacy.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds by adding four stores to the product range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
“We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty products to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on special training workers who are always willing to advise.
Our brand choice meets every need. The attractive environment and comfortable locations mean, however, that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trade, which may change old ways of buying –
Peter Jones's a screw-up because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of a deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left “in the rough – when the TV director Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of a transaction in his life style brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's gonna take a little time for the trade mark Truly.
A couple of business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV show, This Morning, announced that Instagramis had left.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star in the anger of Peter Jones, acting out of their luxury lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was “marivihane, ” when the TV star girl acknowledged at a difficult meeting that took place in Marlows Buckinghamshire on Tuesday at the headquarters of the man’s business empire, that her new contracts worth 1.5 million pounds mean that she no longer have enough time to commit to the brand of household and clothing. Truly.
Business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and it was thought to double Willoughby's estimated 11 million pounds of property.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby reported that he left Truly, Jones left Britain in one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main priority.
It was supposed to ensure his more distant future, so she thought she would do it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left left everything that was involved in the matter to be totally puzzled.
No one could believe it was Tuesday because it was so close to placing a series of products on the market.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods –
Experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid celebrities in Britain can be paid to the company by the head of the TV show “This Morning” because millions of products with the choice of diivanipers and candles to clothing and household clothing have been invested in a high amount of money.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children's mother Willoughby and her wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go together on holiday trips and Jones has a 40% share in the Baldwin teleproduction company.
Willoughby will be a brand member of M&S and he will exchange Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series – I'm A Celebrity –
One of Jones’s close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business, ”
A tough talk “because of what we fell in love ”
Trump joked on the criticism that was directed at him in the news for his comment, which some considered to be ‘ worthy of the President ’ and too much positive about the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his some sort of “renewal ” voice:
\"I haven't given up anything. \"
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear ceasefire of North Korea, interested in the second meeting.
But the negotiations on the ceasefire of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho World leaders on Saturday UN General Assembly said that North Korea did not see a reaction to the United States, the North Korea’s initial disarming steps.
It noted that the US will continue to apply pressure limits to the country.
Trump's incentive call was a lot more enchanted.
“We are doing very well with North Korea, ” he said.
“Norway Korea was about to start a war.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now it’s all very well between us.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results: has completed missile experiments, has been helped to release hostages and has been arranged to bring American servants' remains to their homeland.
He also protected his unusual relationship with Kim.
“It is very easy to be friendly, but instead of allowing 10,000 people to wait outside for access to this fully-fledged stadium, it is better if we have nearly 200 people here, ” said Trump, referring to the crowd in front of us.
The tsunami and the earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
As regards the eradication of the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, no national disaster was reported as a prerequisite for international aid.
“They have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international aid, so that the stories are a little complicated, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children put together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, President of the National Disaster Office, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciate the situation in Palus, in order to decide whether international authorities will be allowed to contribute to the provision of assistance.
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has been surprisingly few prepared to deal with natural resources.
Although Acehi has been built for the tsunami, they are not very common in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given on the tsunami, the absence of the siren of the tsunami probably increased the number of deaths in Palus.
Traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is also quite a challenge in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that stopped to treat victims of the earthquake in Lomboki is headed to Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at the new scene.
President Joko Widodo turned Indonesia into a central part of its electoral campaign to improve divided infrastructure and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, the deficits in the budget threaten Mr Joko's government, as new elections will take place next year.
Mr Jokot, Indonesia, too, is under pressure by the tensions among those who have turned most members of the Muslim community to the older form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fights between the Christian and the Muslim gangs on the streets in which maths, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons were used.

“I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I gave him a little more thoughtless, ”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 was led by the 25th game minutes by the Belgian star Eden Hazardi to the gate.
The blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovac before he turned around in the middle of the field and fed to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic gave fast food on the middle field.
Then he created a beautiful air feed, leading to Hazard's penitentiary.
Hazard got through the defense and created a network in the direction of a mail from Alison Becker, the left foot of the ball.

The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 this morning at Grayson Mewsis John Street.
The police are calling to contact the people in the area who might have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The news is just at the beginning, but I would ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhea and heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.

Mr Cromwell's shape is the last reminder, which is “the reason for the transformation of history.
To eliminate this would be a natural justice for the destruction of so many English cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style, which the followers of the man’s inhuman vultures would do.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as foolish and attempt to rewrote history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's company, said: “In the discussion about removing images, it was impossible to ignore the monument before Oliver Cromwell's Westminster palace.
Cromwell didn't take pictures in the English Civil War himself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man was sacrificed for the works of the previous century by the ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical description of the person who, in the opinion of many people, is still to be respected.
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “A few people prefer to see at the end of the 19th rather than today the external pressure of the Cromwell Parliament and, in this case, of course, the power of the King.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the future development of our people and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as the Master’s Protector also deserve to celebrate and commemorate:
A Chinese farmer snooped with a killer.
According to local media coverage, in Edela-China, a farmer was attacked on the market by a pig who killed a man.
A man who was only identified as a family name, Yuan, was found dead and blood-scene-scrupulously in Liupanshui near the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China newspaper ‘Morning Post’ on Sunday.
Manufacturer's manufacture of pigs in the province of Xingis Qinghai on 30 May 2005 in China.
He had come from Yunnan with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found a cousin dead and discovered that the other side was open.
He said that the crowd had a big, bloody mouth.
The investigation of the case confirmed that the 249,47 kilograms of iron had been strung to death by the farmer according to the report.
“ My cousin’s feet were all bloody and loose, ” said Guiyang Eventing News, “the victim’s words were cousin Wu.
The security camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 04:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
Her body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The Market Manager told Eventing News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't be able to attack anyone else until evidence was collected at the police scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the husband's death.
Although rarely, it has been observed before that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig was attacked by a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, she nailed 294,83 pounds of pig to the tractor by the farmer of Wales until a man's wife scared the animal away.
When in 2012, one of the farmers at Oregon ate their own pigs, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs would not usually attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could be turned off.
\"They're just playful.
They're very curious marakrats whose aim is not to hurt.
It's just that you have to give enough respect to them, ” said the man.
The post-traffic winds of Orcan Rosa produce extensive rain stories in the southwest of the United States

In the meantime, there will be a low-level climate over the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the U.S.., when Rosa is approaching the Baja coast of the tropical storm on Monday, it will start to channel deep tropical moisture towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25,4 centimetres of rain.
The tropical humidity in the south-west of the country will then produce extensive strong rainlights in the coming days.
There are between 2,54 and 10,16 centimetres of dangerous sudden rainfalls, flood water, and possible paint leaks in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall between 5 and about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona strain.

Acute conditions are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly worsening conditions.
Certainly, there should be no movement in the desert where tropical rainfalls are at risk.
A strong rain can cause canoes to become fast-flowed rivers and lightning storms with nodules and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure will lead to acute rainfalls in the southern California coasts.

Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people, Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and a woman who was allegedly accused of sexual violence in the 1980s, were looking at the confessions of Christine Blasay Ford.
At the same time, the political congestion continued, where broadcasters interrupted the last minute of the Friday show: Senator Jeff Flake made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week prosecution investigation.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee that he was absolutely sure Kavanaugh strangled him with his head drunk and tried to tear off his wife's clothes at high school.
Kavanaugh said in his church confession that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 20.4 million people were probably watching the transfer on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has difficulties in calculating the number of people who look at transfers in the authorities.
In comparison, it can be said that this is about the same big audience as the football final tournament or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all nets to an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
ABC 3,26 million viewers stayed on the other side.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest was also great after the trial.
Flake was the middle character of a Friday drama.
After a statement by the moderate Republican bureau that he was voting in favour of Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS hit the man's Friday morning, when he had fallen into a protester's lobby, trying to take the elevator to the Committee on Legal Affairs.
He was on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
“I stand right here, in front of you, ” said one woman.
\"Do you think he's telling the country the truth,
He was told: “You have power, while so many women have been put to power, ”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added that before closing the elevator, he had more to say at the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected the direct transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to send Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said that he only did it in a sense that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake convinced me to have a partial conversation with Senator Chris Coons from a friend of Democrat.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not be able to meet Kavanaugh's votes without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI regarding Kavanaugh's charges.

The voters decided to favour independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the opponents abstained widely.
According to the Katalaan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to hold a vote in front of the polls in the region, which led to violent collisions.
The parties to independence had spent Friday night before the polling stations in order to avoid public police statements of support.
However, the demonstrations took place, but they had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a disfellowshiping demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had the hope of looking at Kataloonia on his own.
“ One of the best moments of our life took place last year.
I saw my parents crying out for a chance to vote, but now we are stuck, “he said.
Despite the significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting the independence of Catalan to maintain their work this year, as a number of more well-known leaders have either gone into exile or have been held in detention and are waiting for judgment over their part in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded a demonstration to support the police with his cell phone, said that the fight was driven by politicians from both sides.
“ This is getting more and more tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Katalans leaders, who have been in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he would participate in the elections of the European Parliament next year.
\"The European Parliament elections are the best way to condemn the restoration of democratic values and the pressure expressed by the Spanish Government,\" he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was scratched by the house
Three men were arrested at 33, 34 and 39 after a car in Londonderry several times at the house.
The case took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. according to British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was made to the gates and buildings.
They could also have let vibunol in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga hits Livingston 1-0 victory in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first gate for Livingston was the victory
Published in Livingston's open Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to the second loss during 18 games when a man has been Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's hit was decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
At this season, Gerrard will win on the first league and will stand with the leading Hearts on the next Sunday, eight points on earth.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Visits on Thursday in Euroliga.
In the meantime Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss from Kenny Miler's replacement last month.
Livingston loses the opportunity for Ninth visitors
The Holt team should have been running long before the gate hit, as their instant playmate caused Rangers any problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts ran out front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to hit Craig Halketti's headline over the gate.
The strangers were calmly letting Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems to the guests in certain places.
And it's also a way of hitting a decisive gate.
Rangers gave up the free shot and Livingston had an opportunity to play with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Men, who took the ball and managed it from the center of the penalty area.
By this time, Rangers mainly held the ball but could not penetrate the defense, so Liam Kelly, the gatekeeper, was mainly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate one time.
The Rangers gatekeeper Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's strike and Lithgow shined brightly in another crew job in Livingston.
The attacks were constantly in the area of Livingston, and they were systematically thrown away from it, and they were also directed at two punishments, one of them for the Halketti Glenn Middleton replacement test and the other for touching the ball.
Fenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium
Fenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder up fully with expectations.
Their game style and players have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt needs to be honored by how he has escaped the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge by organising an excellently organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time in the game on his backs.
But the Rangers got inspired.
Regardless of their good level between them under Gerradi's leadership, it was little of this as set out here.
Their last possession proved to be incomplete: reaching home only once, which could be used as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's conflicting reception in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (29 September) there were smiles and concerns when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is President Erdogan's conflict with the last day of his visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded from issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Köln to open a new giant mose.
The largest Turkish community in the city is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the collection of 25 000 members in front of the mob, but a number of supporters appeared close to it to see their president.
Hundreds against Erdogan, many of whom are deaf, also made their voices heard, condemned both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German Government to host the President of Turkey in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that the attitude of a guest is divided: some of the Turkishs living in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - rule.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: a bicycle was killed by a car crash
In London, a bicycle that had fallen against the car was killed.
The crash took place on a fast road near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street intersection in Deptford, south of the city at 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide ambulances, but the man died at the scene.
A few months after the second bicycle was killed in a crash about two kilometers from Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver on the bike escaped from the scene.
The London police said the authorities are working on identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
The site of birth is closed and the buses are rerouted, and drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartini penitentiary: six prison officials were injured in the calm.
The prison office reported that six prison officials were injured in the unsafe men's prison.
The reliefs broke out in His Majesty Long Lartini's prison at Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 p.m. according to British summer time and not yet finished.
One of the intertwined unrests related to eight prisoners is involved in the handling of experts in mountain police officers.
Prison officials were treated with milder facial injuries at the scene.
He said: “Chairmans with special training have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartini prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, they are transferred to the police and their imprisonment may be extended.
HMP Long Lartini has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden was informed that he was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, we were invited to the prison of the Hümru police to silence serious unrests in which prison officials were attacked with pools.
Oran Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a sudden threat (the Orcan may be useful for the fundamental regions)
The tropical low pressure does not catch Arizona often, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week when the raging orcan Rosa moves across the south-west of the U.S. desert, bringing about a sudden threat.
The National Air Service has already held a sudden follow-up on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to an advance, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfalls.
Phoenix's National Air Service stated that “from 1950 until 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have kept the levels of tropical storm or low pressure from Phoenix at 32,86 km radius!
Katrina (1967) was an Orc, which passed from 64.37 km from the Arizona border.
The latest national orcan centre models predict a rainfall of between 5,08 and 10,16 centimetres, which can reach Arizona Mogollon Rim in restricted areas up to 15,24 centimetres.
In other desert areas of the U.S., including the middle part of the Kaljumäegägi and the Great Witch, the amount of rainfalls is likely to amount to 2,54 to 5,08 centimetres, extending to 10,16 centimetres in restricted areas.
The rainfalls of Rosa may be a blessing to the emerging fields, as the region is struggling with drought.
Although floods are very worrying, such rainfalls are likely to be useful as droughts in South-American America.
According to the U.S. field monitor, at least 40% of Arizona's extreme, or in the second category, reported Weather.com.
First of all, the Ora Rosa Baja California Islands are crossing Mexico's land.
Rosa, which was still on Sunday morning with the largest windshields at 6,43 miles per hour, is now 619,95 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 km north per hour.
The storm is in contact with the chilling waters of the Pacific, and it is therefore a bit depressing.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will reach Mexico’s land with tropical storm strength in Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain areas of Mexico may be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From California to Sonora, rainfalls of between 7.62 and 15.24 centimetres can be expected, reaching up to 25.4 centimetres,” informed Weather.com.
Then Rosa goes north of Mexico's tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday's early morning as a tropical lowlife that moves across Arizona and reaches the south of Utah on Tuesday's late evening.
“The danger followed by Rosa or its consequences is very strong rainfalls in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the United States, ” said the National Orange Centre.
These rain lights can cause life-threatening sudden floodings and flooding in the deserts and paints in mountain areas.

The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths rising
At least 384 people were killed and many threatened when the giants attacked the beach after the strong earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawes' island in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in Palu town, when, at the first time, six feet [6 m] of waves hit the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left on the road.
Tsunami followed the 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their actions, not running away immediately, remaining victims, ” said BNPB’s press conference at the Indonesian disaster relief office in Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
“ Tsunami did not come alone, but took cars, logs, and houses, wipe everything off the earth, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved at a speed of 800 km per hour in the high seas before it reached the shore.
Some people climbed from the tsunami to escape the trees and survived, said he.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 centers.
Air photos published by the Disaster Office showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and congested bridges and water- surrounded moses.
The trails in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Office (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb that was dropped into Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the long and narrow Gulf at the edge of the city may have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “indigenous, ” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rusty parts of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the deaths may be greater than Palust 300 km north of the coast called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggalast “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information, ” said Nugroho.
“ Over 300 000 inhabitants live in the area, ” said Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading towards the affected places.
“ This is already a tragedy that can get even worse, ” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was issued.
The amateur conductors in social media have seen a man on the top floor of a building that warns against a tsunami moving in a panically below the street.
A minute later, the water wall will reach the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major loss of electricity, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has started sending transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to help them, said the authorities, but the evacuationrs still need food and other basic items.
The airport located in the city was reopened for rescue work, leaving the rest closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to Indonesian tsunamis increased by more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although the employees of the World Vision arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the demonstrations of their office, they saw the images that were happening on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
“ They said that they saw a lot of destroyed houses, ” he said.
It's very bad.
Although the relief efforts were strongly started, the workers of foreign aid organisations with great experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rules, foreign funding, stocks and reinforcements can only be sent if an accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It continues to be a disaster at province level, ” said Aulia Arrian, a pressist of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘ Yes, this is a national disaster, ’ we can start to receive international aid, but such status has not yet been declared, ”
When the other night, after the earthquake and tsunami on Fridays, the friends of the lost people and their families were still full of hope that their loved ones are the wonderful cases that ease natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised out of the sewer well.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman trapped under her mother's body for two days.
In Indonesia, a national team of liblangelists coach Gendon Subandano trained two missing slippers for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of us trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added to Mr. Mandagi.
“ I have a personal burden as a archeologist in the Señor, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon was talking about how he was desperate to send messages to Palu's competitors who were at the beach festival after the release of the news from Roa Roa Hotel.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“ I think that means that the messages did not arrive, ” he said.

Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
The rapper Kanye West turns his name Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, a man wrote: “Endine Kanye West,
Of the 41-year-old West, Ye has been called a nickname for a while, and the man also used his name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The amendment will take place before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande, a singer who cancelled his concert “at the hour of feeling, ” said the author.
In addition to the short name of the man who is present, West has previously said that this is a religious word for him.
“ I think that ‘ye’ is one of the most popular words in the Bible, which means “sina, ” said West earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“That is why I am you, I am us, it is us.
I changed my name from Kanyest, which means “one, ” to be called Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
Album is more a reflection of who we are,
Kanye West isn't the only rapper playing with his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that prefers names of Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also used his name with and without the spirit crisis, with large and small letters.
Mexican politician AML promises not to use the military against civilians
At a time when the state approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks against students, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican presidential candidate, has promised never to use the military against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised that ‘ he would never use military forces to control the Mexicans. ’
The army attacked a peaceful demonstration on the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when all of Latin America had to bear left students’ movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public schools.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area, ” said Kai-Fu Lee, a donor and artificial intelligence operator, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements regarding artificial intelligence, although the US does not have a comprehensively formal technology for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, last year, China introduced its plan to be the man who made artificial intelligence reform by 2030.
“The dualisation of the research budget for telecommunications would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the US and we are working for the next artificial intelligence breakthrough, ” said Lee.
The double financing would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would be made in the United States, said Lee CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face+.
In the 1980s he worked with a artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best American Othello player. Later he was the man at Microsoft Research Board and the President of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the technology competitions of the previous U.S. government, such as the U.S. Department of Defence Research Research Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“ U.S. scientists have to work hard to get funding from the government, ” said Lee.
“The Chinese is not the one who takes over the students, but they are companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired great scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy could help the US to support the efforts of artificial intelligence.
“In the field of artificial intelligence, persons who have received a doctorate should automatically be offered a green card, ” said the man.
The Chinese National Council published the next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Research Fund and other government institutions allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a combined artificial intelligence centre aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions.
DARPA announced this month that it started to finance two million dollar initiatives on AI Next.
But the National Research Fund is currently financing over $100 million a year for the research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, there has been no amendment to the US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of national name
On Sunday's referendum, the Macedonians voted on whether to turn the country's name into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would also resolve the tens of decades' dispute with Greece, which has prevented the accession of Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, claims that its name for the North-Eastern is a requirement for that territory and has refused Macedonia to join NATO and the EU.
In June, governments of two countries agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but the opponents of the nationalists claim that the name would harm the national identity of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to take part in the referendum and that the anti-abuse campaign had raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity would achieve the necessary rate of participation of 50% for the referendum.
The referendum asks: “The accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU, in agreement with the agreement with Greece,
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us, ” said Mr Georgijevska, who was 79 years old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament's vote is required for change of name.
The National Electoral Commission said that at 13:00 there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the election activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, and we have a place in Europe, ” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Scopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Duskko gave him a vote on 30 September 2018 in the Macedonian referendum on the modification of the country's name, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage in front of the parliament building in Scopje, raising the chairs for those who would ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of the servants, ” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have the wrong one.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become European-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring over 20 percent unemployment investment in Macedonia.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of name, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO, ” said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said that “Yes-word ” would be“ our assurance of the future, ”
The results of the survey published on Monday in the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies revealed that the referendum intends to take part in 30-43% of voters, which are subject to the necessary electoral activity.
The survey of Macedonia Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would respond, “Yes, yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would constitute a first serious blow to the Western government policy after the government took over the leadership in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes to the gate on behalf of the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense by ensuring Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England.
Aguero made it look like the gate hit by his 65th gamers was ridiculously easy.
Argentina's attacker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the order.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke out another defender before he ran over several players at the Brighton Penal Code.
Then he hit his left with Sterling.
The British attacker used the first strike to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to hit Mathew Ryan with a hit on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with his feet, ” said Manchester City Mountainer Pep Guardiola reporters.
\"We told him he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the gate at that point.
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the original success of the Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on the Brighton territory.
He sent the ball nicely to Leroy Sane on the left side of the air.
Sane got hit a ball a few times before he ran away from Sterling.
Sky Blues created the ball in the net just before it slipped out of the borders.
Manchester City plays Masters in the League Subgroup with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rocky.
When the Nationals left the final tournament games, there was no big reason for the new start.
But Scherzer, who's a fighter, is hoping to do his country on Sunday, Colorado Rockies, but only when Rockys, who runs a game in NL West, is still hoping to get to the final.
On Friday night, Rockies guaranteed that Nationals won at least 5-2 jockeys, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“Even though we don’t play for anything, we can at least try knowing that playing in this audience and another team in the atmosphere in Denver is probably higher than any other game that can wait for me this year.
Why would I not want to compete here?
The Nationals have not yet appointed a Sunday openinger, but are allegedly inclined to the Scherzer feed in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feed, made a warm pan on Thursday and would normally be eaten on Sunday.

Trump's got an incentive call in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the election activity of the Republic in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is a big event I do not apply for, but I actually apply, so I am everywhere to fight for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely extreme group of Democrats. You see this happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power by using any means. You'll see their sisterhood and their dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross for power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give them that.
Democrats are, according to his claim, on a mission designed to “sit and prevent ”
“ And you have seen it in the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “wrecks, wicked ones, naked ones, and false ones.
He referred to Senator Danne Feinstein, who was a Democrat member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, who was screaming out loud among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, wait, it was one of the worst examples of body language, even though the worst body language I have ever seen,
The campist party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable to those who express their opinion
When my local party Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I am the last on the campist list of Members who are told that you are not welcome, and all that for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, became a part of the same treatment, as he was strongly opposed to the anti-Jewish nature.
As far as I am concerned, I was numbered by the judges for non-conspiration with Jeremy Corbyn.
In matters of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are, in principle, similar to those in which Jeremy was also dissatisfaction with previous leaders.
In the Communication of the campers of Nottingham East, it said: “We want the meetings to be accompanied and created.
In most cases, the experience of my eight-year local Labour Member is precisely this way of seeing the meetings of the General Assembly of Friday evenings.
Unfortunately, at today’s time, this will no longer apply to most meetings and the promise to be in politics “slighter and more generous, ” has long been forgotten when it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different points of view are not acceptable in the Leiboristic Party and that, for each opinion, it is assessed which is acceptable for the Party's Bureau.
This started just after Jeremy became the leader. A co-worker with whom I thought I would share similar political views now expected me to change my mind and take my views, which I would never have agreed otherwise, whether it was national security or the single market.
Whenever I come up publicly, no matter what I actually say, it will be condemned in social media, encouraging my return, ignoring party politics and saying that I should not be part of the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my fellow workers, as comments on my side are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those fellow workers who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how abuse levels have become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote tolerance culture.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a large association and that we are no longer so much more limited by any change in the initiative or electoral rules.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years to keep my head down, to speak less, and “it would be fine. ”
But that's not what I came to do in politics.
Ever since I joined the Leiborist Party 32 years ago, as a school student, motivated by the care of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom at the point of literally collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who most need it, acting as a member of the local council and minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East was confused about the areas of non-assistance with my political views or with my local leadership.
For all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But, in fact, it is not the only message that I have, which is meant for Nottingham, but for my parties, whether they belong to the Leiborist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that not one of the threats of return or political considerations will stop me from acting for what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moving to the top
Two late events may have been somewhat cursing, but there is no doubt Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun Tennent first league game.
They are now the only non-attached team in the front end of the table of ten.
After all, this team was a high level of protection and better risk taking, which led to the home team's victory and coach Peter Murchiel is fully entitled to be satisfied.
“We have been tried all the time in the games, and we are still invincible, so of course I am happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “A friend of Ayr, they used their opportunities better than ours, ” said Robyn Christie.
Grant Anderson's 14th act, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri a success, but to Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who gave the Yellow Card to Warrens, an opportunity for Jason Baggot to perform a failed attempt.
Climo increased the interests of Ayr with a penalty just before the end of the half-time, reaching a single half-time in favour of the 17-5 Arii.
But Melrose successfully started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which took over Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
A long delay then took place because of Ruaridh Knotti's serious injury, followed by a man's release on the carrier frame. Ayr's successes continued to increase further thanks to the Stafford McDowall's experiment, which was transmitted by Climo.
The active captain Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but again, Melrose's player paid for the failed transmission of Bruce Colvine after intense pressure.
However, the team playing at home recovered strength again, and when Stuan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advanced Ayrys.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's cast and sent a side guard Gregor Henry to go to the homefield on the fifth test.

There is a memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in the 19th century resource conflict, which is still alive.
These hopes are sometimes the highest of the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision taken by the International Court on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivial is the spirit of momentum, unity and peace, and the state naturally expects the result, ” said Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
The Hulk Bolivers across the country look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will have to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of bitter discussions to give the last independent road to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will be re-elected next year, will have a great deal of weight on Monday's decision.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts think that the Court would probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or, if so, it would become very little.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and have provided that they do not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that a decision by the international court is made only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that it was not “a difficult case, ” said Mr Zarate, expert in international law.
And far removed from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have made the situation worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by current authorities in Bolivia, ” said Zate.
Morales' military beauty speech has lost the benefit of the rest of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was in an unnecessary hurry.
Monday gives Bolivia “a special opportunity to start a new era in the country’s relations with Chile, ” and the opportunity to“ put an end to conflict with mutual benefit for 139 years, ” she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known Presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue to express political error.
“Boliavia never gave up her right to access the Pacific Ocean, ” she added.
“It is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea said there was no nuclear release until the country could trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He invited the United States of America to review the promises that the leaders of the competitors gave to each other during the Singapore Summit.
He comments during the time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo almost seems to be starting nuclear diplomacy again for more than three months after the meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, it is airlocks that the US continues to restrict itself and refuse to end the war with Korea is forced to give up North Korea.
Washington is careful about such a statement when Pyongyang does not take first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the weapon that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim and Trump Summit.
Paris Moejus will bring to the viewer a series of massive headbrows bringing to the buyers on their shopping venues in their neighbourhood
If you want to increase your cybercollect or protect yourself completely from the sun, you will no longer have to look for it.
Disasters Valentino and Thom Browne brought on the stage a series of strange superstitious main streets that blinded Paris' fashion week.
The high and impractical hats are this summer through the Moes Instagram, and these designers have sent their walking works to fashionable.
Valentino's top piece was a model head covered with overpainted beige hat, which was decorated with a resembling wide edge.
Other oversized clothing facilities included scars, wizard hats, and even an ananases, but they do not have to heat up.
It also showed Thom Brown's strange mask selection, doing it exactly at the right time before Halloween.
A large part of the colored masks had their combined mouths, so they reminded Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the work reminded me of the diving costume with the air pipes and glasses, while the other reminded the melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge moorings, you're lucky.
Moeguruuses predict that the super-sized main roofs can also reach the buyers in your vicinity.
The large hats are coming right on the back of La Bomba, which is a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimetres, seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand created by a highly unusual hat in social media sent another big piece of work – a beach bag of straws that is almost as big as that of a bikini model.
The Dark Orange Raffiat, with raffles and white leather, was at the top of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in 2019 at the Paris fashion week.
The famous style Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the next summer. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore demand for huge clothing items.
John Edward: Language skills are important to the citizens of the world.
Scotland's private schools have remained at the top of the academic top level and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, which will strengthen personal and shared success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
The schools where more than 30 000 students study all Scotland and represented by the Scottish private school council (SCIS) are trying to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as citizens of the world.
As a education sector that can design and implement a curriculum adapted to the conditions, we can see that modern languages are still well-known in schools and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it gets into his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will reach his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we see that the front end of the tables is languages with the highest rate of examination among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high result of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scotland's private schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are in private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM educational materials (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
The study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find workers for free jobs, 17% of respondents to lack language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
In so far as more desirable job offers require language skills, this skill is becoming essential in a globalised world.
Notwithstanding the career choice made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of respondents do not speak well enough to talk about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage of teachers was French by 15 percent.
It is therefore important to finance language learning at this time for children today.
Many languages, especially those with developing economies, give children a better opportunity to find a good job.
In Scotland different languages are taught at each school.
Hulk school is more focused on classical modern languages, while other schools are taught languages considered the most important in the UK, such as mandarin or Japanese, in view of 2020.
Notwithstanding the child’s interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a number of languages taught by experts in their field.
Scotland's private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what the future brings to them.
It is no longer possible to deny that languages in a global business environment are essential for the future of the country, and it must therefore also be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should really be considered “a transnational ability to communicate, ”
Private schools continue to offer young Scottishs a choice, diversity and ideality.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the private school council in Scotland.

Trump West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign event series tonight in Wheeling West Virginia.
This is Trump's first campaign event scheduled for the next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennesse and Mississippi.
At the same time as the approval vote is pending, until Trump chooses who will be appointed free of charge to the Supreme Court, he shall endeavour to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, since after the vote in November, the abolition of controls at Congress is threatened by the Republicans.
What time does Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch it on the Internet?
Trump's campaign event in Wheelings West Virginia will take place on Saturday night on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 by East Coast time.
The Trump West Virginia campaign event can be viewed on the Internet through YouTube flow.
It is likely that Trump will speak of the meetings of the candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, this week, which became tense in relation to charges related to sexual abuse, while the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for the week until the FBI investigates the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign event series is to assist the new impetus for Republicans facing complex elections in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign manager said that the purpose of these five events next week is to encourage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Presidents.
“The inspection of Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible in the course of rapid electoral campaigns, ” said Reuters, President Trump’s campaign president, who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight's campaign event scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring in the supporters “Ohiost and Pennsylvania and also become a reflection in the Pittsburg media,” reported West Virginia Metro News.

Trump's trying to help the Western Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's running the charts based on polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to encourage his results, ” said Reuters, a politician from the University of West Virginia, Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is full of nerves for competition, keeping hopes high in front of Sunday alone games
After three unilateral sessions, the games that were held on Saturday afternoon may have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The cumulative turning point on the penel is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this one here.
So where do they think the turning point is now?
“They led by six points that have now become four, so I think I can consider it a turning point in a small way, ” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear that four points will be led and 12 points will be left in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomase, who played together all day, and each one got three points in four.
Spieth has been pedestrian in both the wings and the grin and set an example.
These blows of victory have become more and more pronounced with each circle, protecting the determining pipe that would have led to the fourth match's figment after he and Thomas were on the ground with the two.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's faith that the Americans are not yet out of competition.
“You just have to focus more on your game and worry about your fight, ” said Spieth.
It's the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players who have more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have Ryder Cup in the undisputed stars of Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe's strange but loved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood, ” was the only couple who didn’t hit the boyy on Saturday afternoon, also avoiding the bugs in the morning, Friday afternoon, and back on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into both a steep crowd as it goes back, reinforces the opinion that players with whom they will be fought on Sunday, and that if the sun creates over Le Golf National, there is no possible player known as Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm the victory of Europe.
Both at the same time as different holes.
However, the story of Europe's glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, with the four-ball hero of this morning, a quick job when a man was put with a couple of Alex Noren.
Bogey and two times the first nine dig Spanish and Swedish into a deep hole so far that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out in the hole.
Four balls and pairs of games are extremely attractive to look closely at the interaction between couples, the advice to each other, the unsatisfied advice and the way in which a change may occur.
Europe has played better as a team and has been leading with a strong success for the last day, but this nemesis session showed that the U.S. team has a nerve with some, especially Americans, to fight.
Europe is on the last day of Ryder Cup 10-6
Europe will have a good success on the last day of Ryder Cup, leading the United States 10-6 after Saturdays four-balls and double games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two winning Tiger Woods to raise their current score to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European party, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of a lost cup in Hazeltine, ruled on America's half in the morning in the fourth ball, winning series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the match, winning two games, but they couldn't replace the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points to maintain a single game of 12 single games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who won four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who is called Molliwood after the so-called weekend, they are the second couple who has won four points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth ball, they continued in the same spirit by subjugating Woods and the American early Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random shines, but now he lost his 29 four ball and pair games 19, receiving seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested out for the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a couple of games, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the world's first and third place.
Europe did not succeed, although competition was considered pleasant and windy in the south of Paris.
The three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a firm victory in a four-ball race on 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter, later on, and winning in a match between Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, having lost two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team returned from a four-point deficit, going to individual games, although only a week is needed as owners to preserve Furyk's side of the cup.
While being on the other side of two days, after the Sunday counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that “not in any way, ” they do not force themselves unilaterally because of lack of trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN that the continued restrictions on their infidelity against the United States, and that the country does not intend to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that Korea has taken “a remarkable charity action over the last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile trials, the destruction of the site of nuclear experimentation and the promise of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology not to distribute.
“But we do not see the United States responding, ” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, our state does not have security and under such circumstances, we do not agree in any way to make ourselves unilaterally a first-armed person, ”
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to “preventive ” nuclear-free approach, on the basis of which North Korea was to be rewarded when it took gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear non-refoulement, as Pjongjing had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump for the first time at the summit between the President of the United States of America and the North Korean leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards the North Korea Nuclear Non-Proliferation, and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has requested the opening of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relaxing strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The U.S. requires “to abandon nuclear weapons first, ” and increases the pressure on restrictions to achieve their objective forcefully, even against the declaration of war termination,” said Ri.
“ It is a dream to people who don’t know us at all, ” says the Bible.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions will deepen our infidelity,
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted earlier by the U.S. leader in the UN this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the last five months of the three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae and added: “If one of the parties to the nuclear weapons issue would have been South Korea, not the USA, the issue of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.
However, Ri’s statement quickly differed from last year’s previous year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to approach the North Korean missiles to the U.S. continent after “Mr. Evil President-Trump called Kim’s suicide mission“ as a rocketman.
This year, North Korea accepted the full destruction of Trump in the UN's Kimi sky for his courage to take steps towards disarming, but added that there is still a lot to do and that restrictions must remain in force until the North Korea ceases to nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years or five months - that is not important -
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should pay tribute to the measures taken by Pjongyang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"The enforcement of the restrictions of the Security Council must continue to be forceful and unscrupulous until we can fully and permanently confirm the abolition of nuclear weapons...
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by trying to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga from the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a Jewish meeting with Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made after what North Korea understood in just a few hours after “gangster-like demands ”.
In the meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to destroy missiles and nuclear complexes this month, if the United States of America were to implement \" countermeasures\":
He said that Kim had told him that ‘the measures he had taken were in line with the security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the movement towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to relax enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students have to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture, where they learn to study through the night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the world’s best university academics are often helpless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
According to Professor Charles Czeisler of this course, a sleeper at Harvard Medical School and a professor from Brighem and a female hospital, the first person in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he gave a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“ At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked: ‘ Why do I not know now, in my last year of school?
He said that no one ever told him the importance of sleep, it created me to be a priest, explained to Telegraph.
The course that came first in the curriculum this year explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Head of Health at the University, said that the university decided to take the course's curriculum after it was found that the students were in serious difficulty at work during the week of work.
The hourly course includes a number of counter-action tasks.
In one part, the picture is presented in common storage. The students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports footwear and books, and explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sleeplessness affects the sporting results and the importance of the custom that has developed to go to sleep.
The second part explains how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The map of the University Town Hall, along with the responsive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily fashion.
“We know that this does not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes, ” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the night learning marathons are still being proud, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
“ Ensuring a high-quality sleepwalking should be a student’s “saint weapon ” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, ” he added. “It even helps to rise weight because sleep shortages make your brain hungry, making a person hungry all the time.
The 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to create a course, having participated in one of his classes in the previous year, in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the establishment of a university degree.
As a next step, he would like all students in college to complete a similar study program before joining the competing authority.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a alarm clock for both sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting, because it could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate under the Gerradi Men
The Rangers suffered from another bad visiting game when Dolly Menga hit the side of Steven Gerrard brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox's side was hoping to get his first visit from February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was down, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrad's second loss in 18 games as a leader, with eight points left behind from Ladbrokes Premiership's leader in Hearst.
Menga created his gate seven minutes before the half of the time, and the poor readiness of Rangers could not recover from it.
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth position, and Livingston will rise to the third place, remaining below the Hibern with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problem may not be over, as their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was hit by a object apparently removed.
Gerrad made eight changes to the side which led to the Ayri and Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt went on with the same Liv 11 who took a point last week from Hearts and he would have been pleased how his well-trained boys were choking their opponents every step.
Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate already on the second opening, when Menga's first exchange sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor gate, but the half-creating didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs free shot was then found by Captain Craig Halketti, but this defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to make a wide-ranging shot in the back of the post.
The Rangers did achieve control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third quarter of their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident that he should have had a penalty shot when he bumped into the 15th game minutes with Steven Lawless, Judge Steven Thomson did not respond to the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers managed to target only two hits in the first half of the day, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about the Lasana Coulibaly headline or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Liv's 34th-minute opening could break the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performances.
Once again Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher created a ball for Scott Robinson, who kept peace and chose Men who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard was acting at the intermission, changing to Coulibally Ryan Kent. This exchange nearly paid off when the remote player divided Morelos, but impressive Kelly made her stand stop.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the kind of game that fits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt's side could have promoted its leadership at the end of the day, but McGregor was firmly standing by stopping Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big curve.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again applied for a penalty when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson failed to meet again.
Almakh: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanashi: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day of the birth of a future physicist John Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was an invention which eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger also became a pop culture site, as in the 1950s, where they were apparently unlikely to be cowboy scientists in Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What else is this?
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When wearing these headphones, it is possible to hear an atom out of the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Don’t tell me, but this is just going to go down.
“ The Lord, Geiger, died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” pettur cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” – pettur cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to feel as part of the treatment of pettur cells
The method includes the use of immune cells in the patient and the modification of these cells in the laboratory
These can then be seen as a common protein for many cancers and injected back.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated for the immune system with a vaccine that teaches the detection of pettur cells disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory so that they can “seed” a protein that has spread to different HER2 cancers, and then they are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 - directed at the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to patients taking immune cells and being taught to target cancer cells has been used in the treatment of certain types of leukaemia.

You will receive the Saturday Night Live studio at Kanye West, after his mixed speech in which he approved the President of the United States Donald Trump and announced his application for the same post in 2020.
After that night's third song, which was named Ghost Town and where he wore a hat by letter to Make America Great, he began to play against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I’ve spoken so much to white people who ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he’s a race? ’
“If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago, ” he said.
SNL started a device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate judge's committee on alleged sexual violence against Christine Blasay Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go to the show, West's squeakers were loaded in a comic book in Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to take a look at West's mail.
He also complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes in connection with his hat.
\"They tricked me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there, hat in my head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say that I have drowned in a place, “he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the drowned place? I’m putting on my Superman stick because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to “love ”
His comments triggered the evils of viewers at least two times, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person published: “The studio remained a death wish.
West had been introduced to the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the singer was a former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller was a few days earlier dead.
West was amazed by many songs, “I Love it, ” which he looked like a Perrier bottle at the time of presentation.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA from Candace Turner, who wrote: “To one courageous soul: THE GUARANTEE OF THE GUARANTEES TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE RESTRUCTURINGS,
However, the escort leader Karen Hunter agreed that West was just “the one who he is, and it’s absolutely amazing, ”
“But I decided to reward ME (including my own music or clothing or supporting his “artist, ” someone who, in my opinion, believes and distributes a world view that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the shipment, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the former Kanye West ”
He's not the first singer to change his performer's name following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg has also entered the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly donated music legend Prince, who turned his name into a symbol.

Troon game fame Kit Harington does not approve of masculinity
Kit Harington is well-known for his sword's flashy role in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Troonide game.
However, an actor (31) casts off the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be harsh.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that \"what has gone wrong\" and raised the question of how to solve the masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Troon game with Rose Leslie (31), admitted that he felt “industriously, ” that this problem needed attention.
“ I feel quite personally right now that we have gone wrong somewhere with manhood, ” he said.
“What we have taught men when they grow up, in relation to the problem that we now see, ”
Kit believes that the uprising of the masculinity of the bee is partly responsible for television, because it shows superman-made patterns.
He continued: “What is co-born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be the ones they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the bigger questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something wrong has gone wrong for young men, ”
In the interview he also admitted that, after the end of the series, no Troon game would ever participate in the following summer, saying that he was “on one side with his battle fields and horses. ”
Starting in November, Kit Sam Shepardi participates in revitalizing True West, a story about the filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actor recently announced that he considered meeting his wife Rose the best thing to do about the Troon game.
“ I arrived in this series with my wife, so it gave me my future family and my future life, ” she said.
Rose played with Emmy in the won fantasy series of Ygrtte, Kit's characterist Jon Snow loved.
In June 2018, a couple married Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen to 14%.
Health care professionals say that more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases of sex have occurred, thus changing the past.
HIV was widespread by blood transfusions in some parts of China .
However, in this way the number of people infected with HIV had decreased to almost zero, the Chinese health officials confirmed the conference in the province of Yunnan.
From year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV spread through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was established in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT and LGBT is allegedly high.
Because of the national old-fashioned values, studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many disease transfers are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from the employee GOP senator, saying that it is “risk to lies and to the theory of reconnaissance. ”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a representative of the United States, condemned the claims that his staff had posted personal data from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by ‘ultra-Parmals’ trolls and their websites.
“ Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies, ” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The information published included the address and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham (Lõuna-Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahs).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel in relation to claims of sexual overdraft against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked a little after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the mail, was linked to Waters' office and issued member information from the employee of Waters, Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” continued Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are not in any way liable for this information breach.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie-
Waters' statement was quickly analyzed on the Internet, including the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“ This denial comes from anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has a conscience that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They can't be trotch.
They must not question the motives of the defendant.
They must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare the Waters reaction to the critic's criticism against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the time of Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who is applying for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It was true that it was true, ” he said.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned “the relevant agencies of law enforcement in relation to their false claims, ”
“ We all do so in order to identify criminals, ” he continued, “and that they would legally be responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees, ”
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - A Low-Sustained Rowan Atkinson Spione Paradoid
Today, it is the custom to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films and it seems particularly appropriate for Johnny English's Härulikumõdia parodi series, which began in 2003, with Johnny English, and became consistent with Johnny English reborn in 2011.
Is it a humorous joke about the subject, how obviously stupid are we in the country's new export facility?
In any case, Johnny English, an incompetence with a rubber face, has been allowed to do things again in his crafty way - and that this broad comic creation is designed for non-English-speaking film areas.
Of course, it is a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious smut glamour, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a bit of a character who gave Chariots of Fire to London's opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on a character traveler and an international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten TV commercials at Barclaycard, who only leaves chaos behind.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English helicopter when he was wearing a medieval iron wire and helicopter wingers for a while, he choked on the helmet.
Atkinson's talent is shown to make a physical comedy, but humor seems to be less important and strangely excessive, especially when “truths” spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer a comedy.
It seems that this sense of humor is more meant for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English is not so resourceful and focused as the Atkinson dark movies on Beanina.
Today, there is an eternal assumption that Britain is in serious distress.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the British highly secret spy web network, exposing the personalities of all British secret police officers, making it a great disappointment to the local agent - a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a partyable and in need of a man who suffers from the burden of political un populism: Emma Thompson is doing this perfectly, but there is not much to work on in the manuscript.
His intelligence advisors recommend that, as all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny's English, who now works as a college teacher in one of the fancy institutions, giving secret lessons about how to be a secret agent: here's a couple of good places where English offers a school of Rock spy school.
English flights back to Whitehall for emergency information, and he will be reunited with his former long-time partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service, are once again in action, meeting Olga Kurõlenko's beautiful femme fax to Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls under the hands of a dangerously charismatic technical billionaire, and he claims he can solve all British computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, who is playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough will start with their jantile waiting: they will hide themselves as rapporteurs, put fire on a French restaurant; they will create chaos, contain secret Volta's luxury yacht on board; and English will launch a genuine fit if he tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Old House.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and stormy as it is, the whole thing has children's TV maik.
It's a pretty mid-term stuff.
And as with other Johnny English movies, I was thinking: does the British film industry really have no role to play in his talent?
The working party denies drawing up a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a turning plan that provides that the British are working four days a week, but they are paid five days a week.
The party wishes that the corporate supervisors forward savings received through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers, giving them one additional day off.
That's how the workers would have a three-day weekend, but they'd get the same salary.
Under the heading, this idea would be compatible with the party's economic agenda, and this is how the state intends to rock for workers.
On Thursday's work week, the Trade Union Congress has been approved to take advantage of the changing economy.
The working party’s source told The Sunday Times: “It is said that a review of the draft will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but on Thursday is an effort that is consistent with a party’s approach to balance the economy in favour of both workers and a party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea because the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The president of the Labour Party announced: “The working week of the party is not a party policy or a party to discuss it.
Vice Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to specify his vision of socialist revolutions in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back power from the civil society, from the public leaders, and from the ‘profit service providers’.
The Deputy Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire share, as the Labour Party could make ‘conceptions’ in relation to the perceived dignity.
He confirmed his plan to put workers in company boards and to create ownership funds to give 10% of private sector enterprises equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses up to €561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are speaking in “60 Me, ” whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh might change their mind.
The investigation of charges brought by the FBI against the judge, Brett Kavanaugh, has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's conclusions could have an impact on the termination of support for the Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, you will be asked, “60 Minutes, ” by fellow president, Scott Pelley of the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal something that might make them feel different.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Terribly, ” said Kennedy.
I said, \"I'm going to the interrogation,\" and I said, \"I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he was charged, and I asked him: “Have you done this?
He was decisive, firm and clear.
Graham's voice seems to be on a skull.
“ I am sure of my decision with Brett Kavanaugh and could only be changed in bombing, ” he said.
\"Dr Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett denied it forcefully, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasay Ford.
“And everyone he has appointed could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I can't see anything new coming.
What is the global Civil Festival Global Civil Festival and has contributed to poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, the annual music event will be organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a hugely impressive participation in famous news and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn are seeing the 7th time in Global Citizen Festival, not only enjoying speakers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real objective of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a global poverty project, the extension of the Global Poverty Project. It is an international law group that hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concerters had to carry out a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal in terms of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when 12 years have yet to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to convince them to act or is it just another click button where people feel that they do something important by signing a statement online or by slicing?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million activities of its supporters, trying to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than USD 37 billion of their commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than $225 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group referred to a 390 commitment and a communication that results from their activities and of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The Group appreciates that the funds provided have so far been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership of investors and implementingrs in the United Kingdom The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “to use all the children’s capabilities, ” allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help the country to stop under-doing after receiving more than 4700 calls from Global Cities.
“ With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can turn the under-responsibility into a historical feature of social injustice, ” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, during the London concert in April 2018.
The Group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities, which invited mothers and children to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a FAQ on its website asking, “what makes you think we can stop extreme poverty, ”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-partheid movements, we are sure of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is just a few performers who take up this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use a seafarer to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister of the Interior
According to Washington Examiner, Washington, if necessary, may use its forces to prevent Russia's energy market hit, including in the Middle East, has been published by US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, especially if it is an invitation to a legitimate government, is a pretext for the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to shift energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe, ” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity to make sure that the maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market, ” he added.
Zinke’s statement was turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit company which represents the voice of the US energy user.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and replacement of fuels, ” he said, referring to Russia as a ‘one trick’, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump Administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the ‘ineligible’ project of Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin Moscow into a prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of USD 11 billion, which doubles existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's acute response to the project has been driven by just economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of publishing pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers, ” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak at a meeting in Moscow with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US's attitude has received a feedback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Union (BDI) called on the USA to stay away from EU energy policy and Berlin and the bilateral agreements in Moscow.
“Mulle is a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply, ” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Union, after the recent German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says the Massachusets Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusets said on Saturday that he would seriously consider running for president in the interim elections.
In the Holye Chamber of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the weight of his application.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and it includes the first widow, ” said The Hill.
\"From 6 November, I seriously consider applying for President-
Warren also assessed the activities of President Donald Trump, saying that it would “take the country in the wrong direction. ”
“ I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” he said.
Warren has expressed criticism of Trump and its candidate for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote: “We need the FBI before we get to the vote, ”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren’s own voters do not think that he should be a candidate in 2020.
According to Suffolk University's political research centre/Boston Globe survey, 58% thought it was possible to apply for Massachusets.
32% supported such application.
The survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported possible application and 48% opposed it.
The other high-profile Democratic names discussed in relation to possible 20th anniversary include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would officially decide by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump when he gathers Track Palin PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent the year in Iraq since September recruiting.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with the domestic violence case and charged with charges.
“What my son lives through, what he is experiencing when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who feel the consequences and wounds of PTSD that our soldiers are returning to, ” he told the public at the meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Okoma.
Palin called his son’s arrest in “the living room, ” and said, in connection with his son and other war veterans,“the men come back a little differently, they come back as fugitives, they come back to think of whether there is sufficient respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all other military nations have given to the country, ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the press agent Dan Bennett of the Wasilla Police Department, in domestic violence against women, in the case of domestic violence, in intervention and in the state of drunk possession of the weapon.
The 18 states and the Columbia Region challenge a new asylum policy
The eighteen countries and the Columbia region are supporting the legal challenge for a new US policy that prohibits asylum victims who run from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 countries and regions presented a brief statement of court friends in Washington in order to support a policy on asylum seekers, NBC News.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v Sessions, was not published in August by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The woman said that her associate, and her violent gang members, abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was held in Texas.
Grace's national lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy turned the 2014 appeal Council decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to submit asylum applications.
Mr Karl Racine, General Prosecutor of the Columbia Region, said in a Friday statement that the new policy \"is not going on for decades\" of national, Union and international law.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such a requirement infringes this principle, ” stood in a brief statement by the judges.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also claimed that the ban on the entry of immigrants is damaging the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they will be offered the necessary workforce:
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration courts to no longer give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and violence against gangs.
“The request for asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or political opinion,” said the Sessions in their Communication of 11 June.
The objective of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Memorial rescue operations in Prusus, where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
The situation was more and more threatening for the survivors.
“The situation is very tense, ” said the 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever at the evacuation center of Palu’s city with a baby boy.
“In each minute, new people will arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough clean water.
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the lost things, and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been damaged by a 7.5-magnit-tressing earthquake were overburdened.
Some injured, including crushed back and shoulder arm, were rested outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were still treated due to severe extremities.
The tears filled her eyes when she reminded her of the strong earthquake shattered her fifth floor hotel room she shared with her husband and daughter.
“I had no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in ruins, saying to Haris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming, but then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
The U.S. ambassador blames China for bullying with \"giving commercials\"...
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four daily advertisements under the US daily news regarding the mutual daily benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to disseminate propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the addition paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest tiara magazine - after China was accused of invading US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote advertising trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where import tariffs are adapted.
The anti-dumping measures against China at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to catch the exporters of the States such as Iowa, as they supported the parties of the Republic of Trump, have been explained by the experts from China and the USA.
The U.S. Ambassador in China and the former Governor of Iowa, as well as the Chinese largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and farms.
Branstad wrote in the Sunday Des Moines Register article: “The Chinese have now doubled their temptation by publishing torture ads in our free press.
“In the distribution of the propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s expensive freedom of expression and freedom of the press, putting its paid advertising in Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“On the other hand, there are only limited votes in the streets of Beijing, and there are no real differences in opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is at a certain hand of the Communist Party of China, ” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say what kind of newspaper was going on.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will transfer female candidates before the interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans expect and defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned them that they will see a setback during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding the situation have been in store, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with the vote.
“ These things cannot be taken back, ” said Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell School School of Policy, published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) with regard to the FBI investigation will be sufficient to calm the angry voters down.
“The women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow or November, ” said the Senior Adviser of the Progressive Group MoveO and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors “The November is coming – in their demonstration in the Senate corridor, because the Republicans, who control the judges’ committees, decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidature, despite Dr. Christine Blalayy Ford’s testimony, announced Mickey.
“Dummic ind and internal pollution are getting out of schedule, ” said Stu Rotheenberg, an informal political analyst for the news reports.
People say it's already high, it's true.
However, it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged between 18 and 29 who do not like and often fail to vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts predicted a return when the Republicans went on with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for GOP, ” said Michael Steele NBC News, former Chairman of the National Committee of Republicans at the beginning of last week.
“This does not only concern the vote of the Commission, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was appointed, but it also concerns how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” led the United States of America (a group that helps the democratics to choose) to draw Guy Cecil's attention to the news channel.
However, Americans seem a little divided, who believe in Ford and who are Kavanaugh, but with a little more support from the first.
YouGov's new inquiry showed that 41% of respondents believed or likely Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought it was the same for Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims and at least one of the other charges against Deborah Ramirezi, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford admitted to the Senate Judges Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his family life when they attended a party in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor intends to start a new internet that would put breasts on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a starter to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds up the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In exceptional interviews with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the fact that Inrupt’s goal was to “the world’s rule, ”
“Let’s do it now, ” he said.
\"This is a historic moment...
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own – personal online database – or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to be able to choose who can access this information.
It shall be designated by the undertaking for the purpose of providing its own mandate through data-
According to the CEO of John Bruce, Inrupt is the idea that the company will produce sources, processes and relevant skills to help all of Solid.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, some developers hired to work on a project under a contract, and volunteers' coding community.
From this week on, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to “Facebook and Google whether to introduce a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We do not ask their permission, ”

Bernard Vann: the spiritual monument of Victoria, baptized in World War I, was opened
During the first World War, Victoria’s Christian Church of England celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought out his honor in September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglis and Lehaucourt attack.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper's bullet, and he didn't know he had received the highest British military target.
His two grandsons opened a monument on Saturday at the Northamptonshire in Rushden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “ingeniously symbolic, ” if the stone opened exactly 100 years after the great-grandfather’s prize.
According to London Gazet, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his Battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentini, which led a very thick nebula japjuside and a bullet-pulpulch.
Later, he speeded up the attack line and took it with the “greatest galaxy, ” before he, by himself, speeded up one of the bullets, and created three contrasts.
Lieutenant Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, when only a little more than a month had left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activities were “anything I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful, ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a parade for the great reason led by the brentwood Convenient Youth band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great honour to participate in this parade, ” adding that“ the presence and support of many people shows that a true hero is being appreciated. ”
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 all night long to watch, but they only saw Peppa Peppa in Põrsa.
Imagine that you've been up all night to watch Bellator 206, but that's not a major event for you.
The San Jose match contained 13 battles, including six key cards, and it was shown on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom all night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussis and Rory MacDonald were preparing each other to put their breasts on, the UK viewers had their mouths on fire, because Põrsas Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not inspired by this, especially by those who remained awake until early hours in order to see that fight.
A fan described the switch to children’s comics on Twitter as “a joke of all things, ”
“This is government regulation, that content was no longer suitable and had to be linked to the children’s programme,” explained Dave Schwartz, the Senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
‘Peppa’, ‘Yes,’
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they intend to work on their schedule in order to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the presentation now, I think we can solve this problem in the future, ” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. Sunday morning, we can’t do it until Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back-to-back text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was government rule.
I can promise you, this won't happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show the reference - as we usually do - we tried to offer the fans more and we just went over time.
This is about the situation:
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt depressed about sexuality.
Tom Daley, the Olympic winner, says he grew up in a feeling that he is more inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24 - year - old young man said that he did not realize until high school that “each man is not like him. ”
Parting with Lauren Laverne Radio 4 was sent to Dessert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed his attitude to winning the Olympic Games by giving the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You will receive the usual long-term delivery guide Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up was less valuable than others, because it was not socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
“ Until today, ” he said, “the feelings that I am not worthy and that I feel different have given me power and strength to be successful...
He wanted to prove that he was ‘ worth anything, ’ and he did not disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time pronks Olympic winners have become a highly assessed LGBT campaign leader, using their appearance to the games of the People's Community of this year in Australia to address more countries in order to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky that he could live openly without consequences and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American film artist Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - “I was surprised to see him. ”
Dale was married to an Oscar who was 20 years old last year, but he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
“ When you were so young, ” he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, it was hard to find someone as old as he had experienced similar elevations and swords.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his ‘all prospects’ have changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything had to do with winning the gold medal, ” he said.
“But you know, there are far more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal's Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Dale said his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that “Dad, you can’t sit in the front row, because by then you’re no longer there, ” said he.
“ I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually finished breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daley won the Olympic Games in 2012.
“ I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to dive in front of the population of the Olympic Games, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Heather Small Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still creates chicken skin for him.

Out of the form, Mickelson was removed on Saturday from Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson will record on Sundays when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to fix his form to avoid a miserable milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday match and a four-ball game.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time winners divided their day into two, being a stimulater and working on their game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hiter, not even at the top of his career, is not suitable for 48-year-old especially to play in a narrow Le Golf National Golf course, where the long hard track is constantly punishing the lost impact.
And if the field itself is not quite scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth competition with the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the original Tommy Fleetwood to win all four competitions this week.
If Americans, at the beginning of 12 single games with four points, begin with fire, Mickelson's competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he did not have much more to add.
“He fully understood his part today, sinned me on his shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said that he was ready for tomorrow, ” added Furyk.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I saw more than that, but it went this way, and we had to choose a way like this.
He wants to be out, like everyone else.
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday than most of the Ryder Cup games will be played by the player.
It can celebrate the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losses and seven figs, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team an additional spiritual contribution.
“He’s funny, mocking, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the crew room, ” he explained.
“I think that the younger players had a lot of fun going on against him this week, and it was great to see.
He offers much more than just a game”
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great country of success will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup in the last day can easily become an unpleasant experience at the beginning of individual games.
The Taanlainen went public at the 1997 competition in Valderram, where, together with Captain Seve Ballereros, the Americans held five-point successes, but at the end of the final line it was dramatically reduced, the victory was won only with a result of 141-2 : 131-2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won it very barely, ” said Bjorn, in the picture after Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 Fridays and yesterdays with 10 : 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can repeat.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points.
We have a goal to win the cup, so let's focus on it.
I've been telling you all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who's against us - the best players in the world –
With satisfaction in how his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to do things.
Tomorrow, we are dealing with completely new obstacles.
It's all about personal performances tomorrow, and it's about something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent, if things go well, but if you're there personally, you're being tested as a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to the players - to do your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's got to go and do it himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will act more personally than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of the Brookline victory team before becoming part of the loss of Europe's under-the-Medin miracle.
“I remember every goddamn word, ” he said in response to the question of how in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you need to start with fire like Brookline and like Medinahis.
If the pace goes in one direction, it puts great pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team according to and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel like this will be a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race and is the best match with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the race.
“I set up my boys in this order, because I think we are well covered, ” said Bjorn about the choice of my individual games.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again
The German Navy's latest high-speed sailboat should have come into operation in 2014, replacing the obsolete Cold War's slow warships, but this will not happen until next year due to the cost of flawed systems and snowballs, the local media reported.
The introduction of a new Baden-Wuertemberk class high-speed sailline ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the military press release published in Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four Baden-Wuertemberk class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the obsolete Bremen class of high-speed sails.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some hideout technologies, such as reduction of radar, infrared and listening signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed parcels should be sent out of the port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that high-level warships, which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad, will become an ageing age at the time of entering the service.
In the last year, an inconvenient F125 expressly reported news when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Vossi shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important ‘ hardware and hardware shortages’, which made the warship useless if they had been used in the battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of the older Bremen class high-speed sailboats.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting its capacity to add future innovations.
The 7000 tonnes weighing ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to flawed hardware, the price of the whole project, including crew training, will also become a problem.
It has been said that this amounts to EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest high-speed sails become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy's capacity is decreasing.
At the beginning of the year, Hans- Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Committee on Defence of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy, in fact, had \"excessable ships run out\".
The official said that this theme has grown as a snowball over time, as old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the high-speed sails of Baden-Wuertemberk class could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secrecy of bats.
The purpose of the new study in the mountainous state of Scotland is to reveal how batting mice use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give a new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future protection measures.
The study of Scotland's National Trust scientists will monitor the regular and soprano games in Inverewe, Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-earned and Daubenton bats.
Special recordings shall be placed in the main areas of the area in order to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field studies using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency and species of bats.
A map and a report on habitats will then be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
The NTS Natural Protection Officer Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show what habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of wetlands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom, the body of leather mice has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and chemical treatment of some construction materials, as well as attacks on cats from pet animals.
The skins aren't really dark.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use complex echo-place techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, is very serious about batting.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, surveys, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even created the first and only special bats in the Threave region of Scotland in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten types of leather are living in Scotland.
The Real Estate Manager David Thompson says that this area is the ideal territory for them.
“ In Threave, we have a large area for bats, ” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is much more to discover about bats, so that the work we do here and in other areas will help us to understand what they need.
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance in real estate, as the undesirable destruction of one breeding and breeding site can kill up to 400 mothers and young people and even destroy the entire local population.
The skin mice are protected and the killing, harassment or destruction of them is illegal.
Dr. Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the leather camp, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our batters, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their families feed, ”
Rondodo rejects rape charges while lawyers are planning to sue the German press
The charges of rape against him have been rejected as “selling news, ” saying that people“ want to advertise themselves, ” using their name.
His lawyers are going to sue the charges of the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of rape of the American city of Kathryn Mayor in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid EUR 330 643,10 for women’s money, so that there was no incident, Der Spiegel reported on Fridays.
By turning to Instagram’s direct video on its 142 million monitors for hours after charges, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was “in debt news, ”
No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s talk is in the false news, ” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner of the news.
They want to advertise themselves with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm all right, “I've got a player smiling.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of Rondo are preparing for the appeal before Der Spiegel in relation to “unusual suspicion of privacy”.
Advokat Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “mortal damage, which corresponds to the difficulty of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”
The alleged event took place in the suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After the night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor claimed to have returned to the hotel room of the player, where he was allegedly raped on the basis of the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that, after the alleged case, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he was a ‘99 percent good man, ’ of whom ‘one percent is wrong from the bottom’.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took photos of injuries at the hospital, but later agreed with an out-of-court solution because he was afraid of “the tax on the hands and was concerned ” because he had a public depression.
Now says a 34-year-old woman that she is now trying to reverse the solution, as the alleged case continues her trauma.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid and this summer he moved to the huge Juve 100 million transaction in relation to Italy.
Brexit: The CAP can begin to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom, for all time, lost its standing as the leader of the world’s automotive industry after Brexit, said Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota's CAP had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would be temporarily suspended at the production plant near Derby in Burnaston.
\"Let's make a deal,\" said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the cross-border stops without the Brexit agreement could be paid for jobs.
The Burnstoni plant, which produces vehicles in Tokyo Auri and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“ My opinion is that when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see a stop in its factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, worrying about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honduras, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that he closes the Mini factory in Oxford after a month of Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of an agreement with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works as necessary, where spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement signed on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may cause delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's stock at Derbyshire's factory, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations has been \"fully calibrated to avoid such controls at the border.
“We want the best solution that we want, not only to use the current success, but to make full use of it, ” he said to BBC Radio 4 sites today.
“Things not only on Toyota, but also on other producers indicate that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set –
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, a representative of Unite’s trade union in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From experience we know that when jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government pressman said: “We have presented a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's great contribution to the meeting with Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week, as the fight against the Supreme candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, announced on the Sunday of the White House.
Mr Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, investigating the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possibility of the President's refusal to rule out justice.
Whether Trump triggers the D.A.'s assistant and thus threatens the independence of Mueller, Washington's rumors have been lit up for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of listening tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President through amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, she went to the White House, notifying her she was going to step back.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump, who then visited the United Nations at that time.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate judge's committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, gave both lessons.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh, delayed the Senate vote.
Trump press rep Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday's news channel Fox News.
If he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed for another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let us look at it and keep an eye on the issue of the press, as always,
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Captain Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to the disappointment of the TV writers, although he added: “I do not argue with the fact that they have been disappointed, ”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President is making more questions and answers to the session than any president before him, “He said, without adding any evidence: ‘ We have looked at these numbers.
The information hours will continue, confirmed Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do so a lot and you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks, so it's happening during the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president, perhaps, demonstrated why, before the gathering of journalists, I was on my way and sometimes with a strange appearance.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff in NHS Scotland regarding the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland NHS to express thanks to the country and wishing for their post-Brexit arrival.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when the UK has remained for less than six months.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of an established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the recovery between the UK and the EU, headed towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie passed through the head trauma to the emergency surgery
Tenssie State Tigers Supporter Christion Abercrombie passed an extraordinary episode after Saturday's head injury and defeat 31 : 27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tenssie Mike Organ.
Tenssee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury was just before midterm.
“ He fell out on the side, and he just fell apart, ” said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie an oxygen on the outside before he was placed on the carrier frame for further inspection from the field.
The Tensee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tenssee) that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details on the type of injury/diversification, and the Tennesse State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tenlessee State during her first season after Illinois overturn.
She had five battles on Saturday before she left the game, which made a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign residents must pay higher temple fees when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign residents must pay a higher temp tax if they buy real estate in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will damage Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The customs duty shall be levied on those who do not pay the tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people.
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher temp tax rate if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to help homeless people, Theresa May today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to harm Jeremy Corbyn's desire to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable living space and target high-income people.
The temple tax will tax individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, placing extra money on the government's wish to fight homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this stamp fee, including higher levels, established two years ago for purchases related to the second home and the transfer - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the non-UK residents purchased in London, which will raise prices and make it more difficult for buyers to get their feet down for the first time.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become “murder cities, ” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy will come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked him to reduce the temp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and he called on May to give up allowances for affordable homes in order to improve the shame of the British housing system.
Corbyn has announced the reform of the reflective residential economy, including rent control and the cessation of the exploitation of innocent people.
He also wishes to give councils greater powers in building new homes.
May said: “In the previous year, I promised to devote myself as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies abroad, are as easy to buy homes as the people of Britain who are very busy.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the tough sleep conditions are a normal reality.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to run Scotland,”
The head of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his “last goal, ” is to be head of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-Estonian club, which is currently on the third floor in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved this summer to the stadium Stadium of Light after he had taken St Mirren back to the Scottish Masters League during the previous season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B, and that's what it was, he told Ross BBC Scotlands about Sportsound.
“But with my father, I grew up watching Scotland in Hamburg, and it’s always something that has brought me back.
But this option will only come if I'm in a successful club leadership –
Ross' predecessors as head of Sunderland have been Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear of such great and well-known names, having previously held up in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it’s a success if I can take this club to the League of Masters.
Because of its structure and structures, this club is undoubtedly a member of the Masters League, “he said.
\"It's not easy to get there, but I can only see myself successful if I can get the club back there.\"
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, prior to being Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among the management staff of the Hears.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third level and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the next championship winner.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkkirk, St Mirrenis and Hamilton Academy.
“This was a real crossroad, ” he recalled.
“I really believed that management was more appropriate to me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, I got a reasonable income and enjoyed some peaks.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I'm still experiencing this with the tension and pressure of my job, but the management just seems more right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm more comfortable now than I've ever felt in an adult age.
You can listen to full interviews on Sunday 30 September at Sportsound, Radio Scotland at 12.00-13.00 BST
According to the study, the best time for the surface is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the flow of pubs in the trouble of Britain, but more pressure has arisen on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars went up by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA business consulting company, prepared these figures: “The continued longer participation in the World Championships of sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June when pubs’ turnover grew by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants became even more difficult.
In June, 1.8% of the sales of reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded most successfully and are the least enjoyed by the restaurants.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not so dramaticly as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent –
Paul Newman, an analyst of leisure time and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of the weather and large societal or sporting events remains the greatest factor in sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the fall in sales is 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses and only time would indicate whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August give some vital relief.
The increase in total sales of beans and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing down of brand-related institutions.
The sales monitoring of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants will collect and analyse the performance data of the 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and this is a benchmark for the industry.

A front pump promotion that compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two
A breast pump company has shared the Internet with two camps of advertising, which compares to the breast-feeding mother’s milking cows.
According to the reports, “the world’s first silent breast pump” was published by the technology company Elvie’s ironic music video to present the freedom that this new pump will give to mothers who want to live.
Four real mothers dance with a hay full of cows and sing: “Yes, I will cut myself off, but you will not see me in the tail, and “If you did not notice, these are not the breasts, these are my breasts. ”
Repeats: “Pumpa, pump, feed children, pump, pump, milk, fill my lady’s milk,”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has produced similar online opinions.
77 000 times viewed and thousands of comments on video viewers are in disagreement. Many of them say it illuminates the milk industry's tent members.
‘The use of cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and born for milk production, but the difference is that they steal children from them in the days after birth, ” wrote one.
Elvie bra pump does not stick the breast-feeding bra in the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: “It is quite tragic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these babies to advertise the breast pump of the mothers who have been kept in their care?
Someone added: A completely unbelievably unbelievably prod –
Part of it's for advertising, and a woman thought it was a bit of a glamorous story.
\"Leian, this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself one of those if I still had breast feeding.
The pumping of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's do it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product, ” wrote one.
Another comment was: “This is a fun advertising (in your workplaces or toilets) to pump and to mothers who know themselves as cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry –
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they've all danced into bras with non-occupational pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel cowy.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes and does not look like a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritable presentation.
With women's expression opportunities and the comparison of dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of breasts and all its challenges, while presenting an extraordinary amount of freedom in the entertainment and familiar key that the new pump creates.
It's not the first time the news has reflected Elvie's pump.
In London’s fashion week, the mother of two children who carried Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the scene.
Thousands of migrants' children went quietly to the Texas border tent camp
The number of children of injured migrants has risen sharply, although the monthly cross-border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and are afraid to break their country's possibility of moving forward, so they demand the child's right to care.
The risk increased in June, when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and share data with migrant authorities.
Matthew Albence, an elder officer in immigration and customs organisation, admitted to Congress last week that the Agency arrested a dozen people who did not request financial support for the accompanying minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arresters did not have a criminal past.
“Also 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ households are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are a criminal background.
So we continue to follow them, ” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the arrest.
Many defend their legal content by videoconference before the immigration judge, by getting company records.
The inconvenients for liberalisation shall be sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum staff and the reports of the system published in recent months - the longer the child is under arrest, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which may lead to violent demonstrations or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more recent in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s fall may be missed due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to a tent without having enough time to get used to it or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many are already in difficulty.
Syria requires immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home in the UN General Assembly, although the state is already in war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil were an illegal pretext of terror control and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and without a prescription, he said at the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war against Syria is almost over. Since 2011 more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “enhance in this holy war until we have cleaned up the entire territory of Syria, both from terrorist groups and from any illegal foreign force. ”
The United States of America has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both the deaf and the Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, more than 1,000 troops have been torn from the war.
When speaking about the military, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he accused the unconvinced fears that prevent refugees from coming to spread some of the Western countries.
“We raised the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their face, ” he said.
\"They are politicising something that is simply a humanitarian problem –
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that recovery aid will not be granted until the war is concluded between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates an Idlib buffer at the last rebel base, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turgy agreement prevented a wide range of Syrian forces in Russia supported by three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘ clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military activities would be hit by jihadists, including Nusra Front warriors associated with Al-Qaeda, who would ‘be destroyed’.
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convince the Committee composed of new members of government and opposition to design the post-war Syrian constitution and to pave the way for the election.
Moualem submitted requests for participation by the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the panel’s work could be limited by looking at the articles of the current Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is also selected for second term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020, if the occupation and scandal had not previously been completed by its presidential office, as is probably what its liberal viewers would like.
What should undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the President’s Office”
Currently viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled in CNN to over 1,05 million and almost tripled in MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the top hour. Compared to a four-year member of 1.7 million viewers, the MSNBC will receive the “The Rachel Maddow Show – 3.5 million cable viewers have kept this rating high during the main news.
“This is the tension that we are involved in, as we do not understand it,” said the Head of the ABC Drama “Designated Survivor” on the Secretary of State, who will become President when the attack is destroyed by Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writers and book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys- Club, “The author, has another theory.
He remembers the pre-election of the 2016 elections in Boston.
The leader told him he'd vote for Mr Trump.
“ Why, ” he asked
“ He said that he would make me laugh, ” mentioned Mrs. Scovell to me.
All this chaos has a pleasant value.
Of course, not as the other TV shows, Washington's rumors can become fatal to Roe v. Wade's future and reunite the desired migrant families and the global economy.
Deportation is just the luxury of the viewers in their preference.
However, a six-hour story show of Bob Woodward’s basic background study, for his book ‘Fear’, and for Paul Manafort’s 13 225,73€ of the Janaconnauna plant Bomber (Washington Post said that it was a ‘seriously self-trustful clothing’, and for the purposes of Mr Trump’s anatomy, the viewer is more than a well-trained citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a serious life series, is that he distributes something every night, ” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the director of the series “Pandan Kunsts” – creator of Brent Montgomery Trump’s performance with immediate actors and day-to-day plan of the event (singing with NFL, praiseing Kim Jong-uni).
You can't leave a hole in your eyes or you've been down since.
At Fleissi's place this week, his home was 80 degrees warm on the north shore of Kaai, but he was dressed in the room to look at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to stop watching Brett Kavanaugh act in the Senate Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on his hair.
“I don’t know how we used to make all kinds of crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of the Western civilization, ” said Mr Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right, ”

There's cash flows going to the hotest white house in the middle of the day.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania will receive a cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the Congress Area by receiving two dominant companies on the same site.
This led to the re-election of the first district of the suburbs of Pittsburgh from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the second line of the special elections last spring.
The Lamb counter-proclaimer is Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the previous 12th districts of Pennsylvania, which will be covered by a new 17th section.
The maps were changed after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania in January and therefore the old lines were divided into anti- Constitutional electoral regions by favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have saved the power campaign, where the financial departments of the largest political parties are building up with money - the Congress Committee for Democrats (DCCC) and the Estonian campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after the button won a lot of viewed March in Pennsylvania 18. Congressional districts in extraordinary elections.
This is where the Republican has taken place several decades and President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Politicians have given a small advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, which was a small setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and held the Panama Hotel until the partners threw Trump out the company's administrative team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to return from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to call back the leaders of the diplomatic mission, as the Ministry's pressman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, it was planned to punish El Salvador, who received $ 140 million of aid from America in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and economic impetus.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level consultation aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organise a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in their efforts to prevent relocation to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue their consultations and to end the debate on any of El Salvador's punishments.
According to the diplomats, the vice-president, Mike Pence, will now be numbered, speaking in the middle of October to talk about government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss national discussions at the request of anonymous stay.
Their discussions confirmed a close analyst to the government, who also spoke on the requirement of anonymousness.
Study History
Next, it may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on the possible justice of Trump, for which there are many evidences in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly studying whether Trump's campaign is linked to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress should change the party, Trump will have to give an understanding in this institution as he would go back to the voters and perhaps even his elderly judge.
There are many howevers here, and I do not want to point out that neither Trump nor his European counterparts are inevitable.
We all need to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We hurried, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual killings.
History is going through such turning points and an unloved march of democracy will get closer or delay.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires the D.A.'s Deputy Director, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the boiling water since it was announced that he had made a proposal to save the President's secret last year, and that he was speculating this position of office.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is incomplete.
“How to react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, do we vote for Congress at the central elections if Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will be on long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was strangled by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz who once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a buttonlight on a table with a hammer.

Rangers Graham Dorans is Rapid Vienna's battle before optimistic
Rangers organises Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will win over Australia, which was previously followed by an impressive link from the beginning of that month against Villarreal in Spain, they will place a strong position in order to become a European League of G Group.
The earthquake did not allow the central player Graham Dorrans to play the first season until 2 : 2 weeks of the game against Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumptable to get better results.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent, ” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and leave the game at a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was usually a fair result.
They were better during the first half of the game, and we were back in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people are supporting us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to this, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys truly enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave behind the previous season and be successful,
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he'd talked to his children about it.
“ People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they do not talk about it, ” explained Holly Snyder, the Vice President of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
But that should start.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare for the care of your family unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these options can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your adviser may have a good plan to pay for their expenses.
For example, your funding opportunities for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid financial policy with a financial value to help cover these costs, or early self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in eos.
Make sure you have a health authorisation to determine a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will follow you at the time of your wish if you cannot communicate.
Also consider the trust in your financial support.
Select a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and she's on her way to the hospital.
Are you capable of answering questions related to medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you can be ready if you need to.
“This is not only a financial part but also a matter for those who would be doctors, ” explains Martin.

In NYC, federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed, and this rare punishment has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) claimed to be using the Home Depot rental car to attack the bicycles along the West Side highways on Alam-Manhattan, with both pedestrians and bicycles on their way in October.
According to the notification of the death penalty in the southern New York region, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and also caused serious injuries to the body.
In both cases, there is a possible death penalty based on the case-law.
A few weeks after the attack, federal jurys filed a 22-point charge to Saipov, containing eight murder charges, accompanied by blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal crimes, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was expected to be “a massive planning and a premonition, ” said the prosecutors, describing Saipov’s activities as“attractive, cruel, and remorse. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alessandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” says the intentions.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
The last case of death of the New York South District Court has passed for ten years.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of two drug dealers, but the outcome was that he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, New York in 1953, when the couple was executed after the sentence of a conspiracy to perform spyage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the case-law, there was no doubt in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he had told the detectives that he was happy about what he did.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to perform the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for an ISIS ticket release in his hospital room.
In 22-point charges, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national defenders, said that they have been “seriously disappointed in the judgment of proceedings, ”
“We believe that the death penalty decision will extend the trauma of all those involved, ” said Patton, instead of a life sentence without a possibility of release.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
According to Mr Toy, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the negotiations with Brex.
Mr Farage promised during today's Tory Conference protest \"to mobilize the People's Army\"
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, because one of the members of the House of Theresa May suggested that they lead their negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a conservative lower house, said on the march in Birmingham, that the UK would be out by now, if Mr Farage were Secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May is facing the problem in the reconciliation of his deeply divided lines, which were highlighted by the conservatives in favour of remaining, joining in the city of his anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers' plan on the track in the middle of the Brexit supporters, icers and EU attacks.
The Allied requested that it continue to make a deal with Brussels despite the counterattack and force Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their package and chaos.
Bone said that Leave Means Leave was gathered in Solihull, saying that he wanted to ‘ abandon Chequers’s plan,
He recommended that Farage be a partner and give him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility we'd be out by now,' he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: “I am standing outside for Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers’ plan:
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not compete in world wars to be in subjection.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the vote in 2016: “The fact that British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is not true.
The supporter of Tory Brex, Andrea Jenkyns, was also on the march and told the reporters: “Say only one: Prime Minister, listen to the people.

Please leave Chequers' plan and listen to:

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after a team record gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this moment on, it became clear that Valtter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas started a good start and left Hamilton almost bored when he first two times protected his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to a box stop and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop later and came out after the Vetsi, but Hamilton went side by side after the day when Ferrari's leader had a hard time leaving the interior to pass after the third Kurkul's attempt to protect it with a double swing.
Max Verstappen started a competition from the back row of the grid and was on the seventh floor for his 21-year-old birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving to the end of the rubber violets and passing from Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally drove to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtter worked hard all week and was a real gentleman along with me in the children.
“ The team has done an excellent job to have one of the two, ” said Hamilton.
It was very poor body language
President Donald Trump challenged Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday as an incident that he had not leaked Christine Blasay Ford's letter, which accused the Supreme Court of calling Brett Kavanaugh for sexual harassment.
When speaking about the Western Virginia gathering, the President did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but, instead, commented on what is happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “wit, disgusting and lying. ”
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate in a few days, is that you see angry and angry, wicked, disgusting and false people, ” he said.
“ If you look at press releases and leaks that are said, ‘ Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question: ‘ Did you leak the document? ’
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak... add it to the senator's face.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein on charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill reported: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s charges and leaked his story, ” said the Feinstein Committee.
“He asked me to maintain confidentiality, and according to his request, I also did, ”
However, his denial was not appropriate for the President, who commented on Saturday at the time of the gathering: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.
In continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purpose.
“They have decided to take the power back without choosing the funds.
You see this evil and disgusting thing, they don't care who they're hurting, who they need to drive over to get power and leadership,\" said the President of Mediate.

Military and passenger aircraft offer help and equipment.
The 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “A new sacrifice will be brought every minute of my life.

Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is speeding up to help the survivors, but we can’t tell them what they can find out.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may become even worse.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the state military: “I am going to ask you to work nights and days to fulfil all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready for this? CNN reported.

Micronesia Air Niugin's airline says that one man has disappeared after the lagoon flight accident.
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and their crew were safely evacuated from the flying plane, now claims that the air carrier, who led the Pacific lagoon plane in Micronesia, has fallen, that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon, they couldn't find one male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The air carrier did not immediately answer the passenger details, such as the questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed on Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the air carrier and the United States Marines said that the plane landed far from the lagoon airport.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew over the runway.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was on very low landings.
“That’s very good, ” said Jayes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to handle the floating plane in the belt height until the emergency exit.
He mentioned that cabin crews were panicking and screaming and that he got a little head trauma.
The United States of America's Marines and Marines, working on a nearby mine, also helped save, using full-cleaning boats to bring people to the shore, before the plane went down about 30 meters.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air accidents related to air carriers registered to PNG over the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
The analyst will draw up a timetable for the night she was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor terminated the case for a review man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the United States Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert reviewer in the analysis of intelligence data.
He brought out to the jury how he used mobile phone calls extracts to re-establish the movements of Jessica Chambers, the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, when she died.
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier statements of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis “sounded because my car was in Nashville...
Another discomfort was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers before the girl died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that the women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted the messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
“He erased her from her life, ” said Hale.
The defense is about to make a trial on Sunday.
The judge said that he thought the case would go to the jury in a later part of the same day.
The High Breed: What is aware of hiphop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, British, claims that hiphop has removed its political messages and social problems from the beginnings.
They want to go back to the hiphop roots and make the aware hiphop again popular.
The bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently repatriated popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
The New York babysitter will sue a couple for a racist message.
The New York nurse complains of discriminatory dismissal in court for a couple of messages that she accidentally received from her family, where her mother was deaf that the nanny was “ordinarily black. ”
Couples deny that they're racist, compared to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed his dissatisfaction when he learned that their new laser service provider Giselle Maurice was black when he came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband, saying: “IIIIIIIII, MUSTANAHALINE MUSTANAHALINE –
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to New York Post, an uncomfortable-sensing Plasco-Flaxman, after understanding his Prophet, claimed that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice appeals to a couple of courts to obtain compensation for dismissal, which she wishes to receive on a daily basis in a sum of USD 350 for the next six months, and the same work that she was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
“ I want to show them to see that it is done, ” said The Post, adding: “I know it’s discriminatory.
A couple have rejected the claim that they were racist, saying that ending a relationship with Maurice was a reasonable thing because they were afraid that after they were offended by a woman, they couldn't trust him anymore.
“My wife sent her something she did not think of.
He's not a racer.
“We are not racist, ” said the Post, a wife’s wife, Joel Plasco’s newspaper.
“How would you give your children to keep the person you have been rude to even if it was impossible?
Your newborn?
Come on.
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “in a very difficult situation, ”
\"Can you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice now, but it added an investment banker.
Although there is still a case, the public opinion has quickly condemned the social media, where they are highly estimated because of their behaviour and thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not interact with the talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bondi, who was born immediately after the book was adopted, said: “It is difficult to put herself in human shoes, who read it for the first time before publication.
It is very fun now to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.
He said that his father could be inspired to write a children's book of small toys, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was the death of his father in the last year.
As a “very important member of our family, ” he added, his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“ He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man, ” he said.
“But since Paddton was so real to him, it was as if your child achieved something: you are proud of them, although it is not your achievement directly.
I believe he looked at the success of Pgyington in this way.
Although doing so was his work and imagination, he always recognized Pgyton himself,
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the ground, his daughter was quickly transferred to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They regularly called, to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive, ” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nadil, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep beating his heart were beginning to disappear quietly and leave his body.
He was a little dead before that, and now the work of all the systems started to stop.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what happened.
I couldn't scream, scream, cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourning his daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who didn't know anything about his experiences.
“No one knew that, ” he said.
“I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible sympathy for Nadia on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her,
A grieving woman's postcards prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have taped the Wales Bridge maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day, ” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
\"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile made the room shine,
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because “he was in a very bad place with his own people, ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said: “I constantly worry about having a domino effect.
Ms. Davis created these maps “to let people know there are people to turn to and talk to, even with a friend.
Don't shut up – you need to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who's been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, with his 15-year-old partner not long after his mother died.
“ He did not say that he felt bad or was depressed or anything, ” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas holiday – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
Ms. Humphreys said that the husband’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “This tears the wound in the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must go ahead and continue fighting:

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair while the FBI starts the investigation
“I believed that if we actually had something that he wanted – a limited period of time and scope – we might be able to achieve unity, ” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would ‘convene’ in the middle of a permanent partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their perseverance was due to the timing.
The election is only in five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans do not go well as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their intentions to become the most wanted man in the world’s highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators, making a call to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
The vote will take place in a Senate of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is not yet clear at the moment whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and to be confirmed by Mr Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea’s troops is going to go away. Under Kim’s government.
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea's troops in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citeing the data of the Ministry of Harmonisation in South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 power streams (2706), their number has decreased in the previous year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea's citizenship has been offered to a large number of North-Western rivers.
According to the newspaper Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have since the end of the Korean War to cross the border illegally in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest borders with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised area between Korea.
China prefers to take power drinks as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often sends them back to the country with force.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in the war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons that have failed.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally allowed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho USA accused the US of not making progress due to sanctions.
“Without confidence in the United States of America, our state lacks security, and in such circumstances, we do not agree in any way to make ourselves unilaterally the first armed person, ” said Mr Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\", and said that he was unfit to judge the Supreme Court.
The President of the Board of Governors, Nancy Pelos, appointed the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh as ‘hysterial’, and said that he was not temperically fit to work as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered an opinion on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I certainly realized that if a woman had happened in this way, she would have been referred to as hysterical, ” said Pelos about her reaction to the testimony to the Senate’s Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he was sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasay Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, describing his family and high school years, and he was often almost screaming and he was not speaking at all.
He also expressly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, stating that he had been accused of the loss of presidential elections in Hillary Clinton in 2016 as an organised \"grotesx and a coordinated reputation\" of angry liberals.
According to Pelos, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is not a judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he has been strangled against the Democrats.
“I find that he disqualified himself with their statements and by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats, ” he said.
The games remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw him if Kavanaugh confirmed him if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Governors.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he does not fit in the court where he is currently working, ” said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is now Judge of the Columbia District Appeal Court.
The games added that as a Democrat he is concerned about decisions against Kavanaugh possible Affordable Care Act (health law – translator’s note) or Roe v. Wade (abort’s legal case-law – translator’s note) because the man is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would withdraw some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a time for a hysterical baptized person to become a judge and wait for us to say that it is not great, ” said Pelos.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, moons and years of gross anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Ms. Steinem, 45 years later.
“I do not think it is unusual, nor ‘
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she also cried when she became angry, but she developed a method that stood by the fact that when she became angry and cried, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ You might think I was crying because I was sad.
I'm angry.
And he just kept on.
And I thought it was brilliant...
The tears are partially accepted as a output of rage, as they are interpreted as fundamentally wrong.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early jobs of most men in the office where I once found myself in an inexplicable rage crying when one of the older women – a strict leader I had always been afraid of – grabbed me and carried me to the staircase.
“Don’t ever show them how to cry, ” he told me.
\"They don't know you're raccoon.
They think you're sad and it's satisfying for them.
Patricia Schroeder, a ultificate Democratic Party Congressman from Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart for the male presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart caught up with an extramarital love story on the basis of a hunting name for Mickey Business and the campaign ended, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“ This was not a well - thought - out decision, ” he said, “as he laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was to join someone else, ”
Someone said that it was like, “Lum white and seven thumb boys, ”
Since the campaign had ended, he was late to raise money, and he promised not to apply if he could not meet two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 gave him $250.
“Do they think I’m going to get an advantage, ” he thought.
When he gave a speech, where he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, his feelings were received – thanks to the people who supported him, the excitement of the system that made it difficult for him to turn to the voters and the voters, and the anger against sexism – he was so powerless that he had a tear on his throat.
“ You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalled Schroeder’s reaction to the press against him.
“I could have thought that Kleinex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my tombstone.

How the US-China Trade War can be useful for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were cursing, and although the battle is far from over, experts say that the gap between countries can be useful for Beijing in the long term.
This year, President Donald Trump of the United States issued the first alert, introducing taxes on significant Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs of USD 200 million (150 ml) per item, essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods arriving from China to the US.
Beijing has always answered the same thing by downloading the last $60 ml of the five to ten percent tariffs to the American goods.
China has promised the US to respond by mistake, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to be blinking as soon as possible.
The withdrawal of Washington would be a denial of demands, but publicly before the United States worship would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that, if Beijing's own cards go correctly, a trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing its inter-economic dependency.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to the loss of control in another country is actually much more dangerous than those who have previously admitted to it, ” said a researcher, Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia’s research at a think tanks Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready to volunteer for refugees and is asking for more than seven years after the war to rebuild the country.
Speaking with the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country will improve.
“The situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government will continue to restore the normality of the destroyed areas of terrorists.
All the conditions now exist that refugees who have left the country, who have been left for terrorism and have been affected by everyday life and living on the basis of unilateral economic measures, could voluntarily return to the country.
According to the UN forecast, 5,5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to receive aid for the construction of a corrupt country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state did not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe took the victory of Ryder in Paris.
The European team won 2018 Ryder's cup competitions, leading in France near Paris at Le Golf National Golf Course with the final result of the U.S. team at 16.5 vs 10.5.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on the European surface and has not won Ryder in Europe since 1993.

“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t keep myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the cup back.
It is a team spirit, and I am glad to be able to help, said emotional Garcia for Europe's victory.
He's giving the tart to J.R.M. Rahm, who won in a single game on Sunday in a US golf course at Tiger Woods 2&1.
“ I feel particularly proud that I won the Tiger Woods – I grew up looking up, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now he has a career in Ryder's cup contest results 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who've won 14 major competition titles, leaving just Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a whole weekend with finding fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team was disappointed, “I’m proud of the guys, they were syllable.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought with them.
He hit me in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PBA and our Ryder cup team and move on.
I love them 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We're gonna have to get the hat up.
We were better played.
