Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves in Muppet Show
Some of the members of the National Assembly were surprised by the proposal that their address would change to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm came to the conclusion that the National Assembly (Assembly) should be called the Wales Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
Now, the various political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title will make them laugh.
According to one working party, his group is concerned that their new name will be marked with the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\".
For the sake of our readers in Wales, the twp is one and the pwp means cocoa.
According to one of the members of the Plaid Party, the whole group is “unsatisfied ” and therefore proposes alternatives.
One conservative representative said that his group was \"opened\" to change the name, however he noted that from MWP only one jumper was \"Muppet\".
It is worth noting here that in the Italian language, the letter ‘w’ is similar to ‘u’ in the English yrkshire, i.e. ‘map’,
The National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law on nominal change is as follows: \"The final decision, of course, is in the hands of the Members of the Assembly. \"
The Law of 2017 governing the administration of Wales allowed the National Assembly in Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the name of the Wales Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the title of the Members, the Commission favours the title of Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Wales Parliament) and its shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation supported the alternative of MWP.
There are new and new alternatives for Members, however, the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to present the draft law on nominal changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly at other points, including the discretion of Members and the Commission's structures.
In the matter of their own title, Members will be able to make their final comments during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, citizens will be voting on whether the country's name is changed to the Republic of Mexico.
The aim of the referendum is to set a point at the end of a decade debate with a neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that, in essence, the name of its northern neighbor has raised a territorial need and has repeatedly challenged its application for EU and NATO take-offs.
The President of Gjorge Ivanov Macedón himself opposes the referendum on the name change and so does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that must be made for their EU- NATO accession.
The bells of the temples of the Harlems, the St. Martins, were silent in a difficult situation.
“In fact, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” Adams says.
- Today, none of them have.
As you say, the absence of bars would be understandable.
“ People are getting involved differently these days, ” she says.
– Bars are no longer the social days for which people go down daily,
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the sale of the church property will not replace the expectations of the leaders, “and in time they will hold again where they started. ”
And the place of the churches will be – it will be – residential buildings whose community is also not helping the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy housing in these buildings will be white leather – they will continue to rush the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those moving into these apartments would join the faith community.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem grew up in the black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out of the temple in the thirty years,
then held in a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the honorary guest of the shopping street, 125th Street, is not to use blacks or sell black products from its business owners.
In 1939 a fire was caused by serious damage in the building, but during the renovation, the bell game was built to order the honorary Johnson community.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Plébania, proudly “the bells of the poor ” mentioned the bell play.
According to an expert in July, this bell game is a cultural heritage, an unremarkable and historical instrument,
The expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell game in the world, which was spoken by a black musician, Diosio A. Lind, who had been involved in a larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Meriweather, the St. Martin didn't sign up for anyone.
In St. Martin over the past few months, a complicated situation has broken down with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs who are partly involved in the secular leadership of the church, partly with the bishop's office.
In July, the head body of Parokia, the Council of the Civil Society, called in writing to the Bishop's Office, arguing that the Office would “take the costs ” to the council, where the Council did not participate in the election of the architects and entrepreneurs who were registered by the Office.
Some members of the faith community complain about the lack of transparency on the premises of the Office.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California while he was fishing for cancer
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while fishing for cancer on the opening day of the shrimp season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7:00 in the Beacon's Beach Coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego told me that he and his friends in the Saturday morning had a dived about half an hour before he was aware that a boy was crying for help, and then he was eating it by himself to help him climb out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the boy was excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “He bit me!
♪ I'm bitten ♪
“ With his key bone, he was ripping his shoulders apart, ” said Hammel, “what he saw when he arrived at the boy.
– I began to urge everyone to get out of the water: “Captain is in the water,” he added.
The boy was transported with an airman to the children's hospital in San Diego where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The tree of the shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Larry Giles told the press, sharks were detected a few weeks earlier in the area, but they found that they were not one of the species that were dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
For the time and security of the investigation, the authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours.
Giles says there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand on the British beauty market.
The Sainsbury's expert would take up the competition with sales and large-scale pipers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
The decline in sales of fashion and household articles is also a part of the expansion of the British beauty market of € 2.8 billion, which is being tested in 11 stores across the chain, and will appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the pipe line is due to the fact that the stores try to fill the previously operated shelf surfaces of televisions, microwave ovens and household articles in different ways.
The Sainsbury's told me that he's doubled his offer to 3000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now the first to offer.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in larger areas on brand-based stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The trade chain also restarts Boutique's family, in which most products are now looking for a growing number of young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which is in Croydon, the south of London, and the other year is opened in the Selly Oak of Birmingham.
With the spread of online purchases and the transfer of food shopping habits to small local trades, large stores should make greater efforts to lure customers.
According to the Director General of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to the mixed trades, as the trade chain is trying to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and other products than food.
Since the two chains were bought two years ago, several hundred stores in the Sainsbury's opened Argos classes and some of the Habit classes, this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain of the store failed in its previous experiment to fill the beauty and pharmaceutical classes.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, however, the debate on the distribution of revenues from the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born after the Sainsbury's sold its drug business to Celesio, operating in 281 business three years ago for 125 million pounds.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider list of luxury leather care products in four stores, with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of the Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by modifying our appearance.
We also hired skilled staff to help interested people with advice.
Our brand offers all the needs, an attractive environment and a convenient location to reach, and it provides an attractive force that increases your shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones, after Holly Willoughby stopped the 11 million-dollar agreement
Dragons’ star, Peter Jones, has left in the attic after Holly Willoughby’s television programmer stopped from 11 million important agreements on the way in which life products are marketed to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand selling home wears and accessories.
The business of the two celebrities was compared with the brand Goop, registered by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old director of This Morning announced that he was out on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby carefully pulled the match out at the Dragons' Star, Peter Jones, when he got out of their promising lifestyle-selling business at the last minute, to focus on his own very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones “stombolt”, when his TV holiday on Tuesday, announced during a busy meeting of their business company Jones (Buckinghamshire) that, due to its new contracts worth a total of 1.5 million pounds, he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to Truly.
The two famous companies were compared with the Goop brands recorded earlier by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets for 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby reported on Instagram to leave Truly, Jones moved from the island to one of his houses.
According to a source: “The Truly was far from the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long term, and that gives him his survival in the next few decades.
The way he got out, it was a surprise for everyone.
I'm surprised everyone that happened on Tuesday was so close to leaving.
In Marlow's office, the warehouse is full of the goods for sale –
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars of This Morning, one in Britain, could cost the company millions of thousands of teats from pillows and candles to clothing and domestic wear and possible slips.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-girl programmer and husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Capp started Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples have a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said: “We do not want to comment on the business of [Jones], ”
“ We may have fallen in love, ” said hard words.
He was joking about the criticisms he would get from the press about the release that some might view as “invertible ” and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“ Why did Trump let so much?
– asked Trump’s funny “seroles ” sound.
- I didn't let him.
As noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after his first trial in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed him as a huge step towards nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have been penalized.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, a member of North Korea, informed the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, the United States did not provide an adequate response to the early ceasefire steps of North Korea.
Instead, according to his statement, the United States continues to maintain sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump said it was more optimistic in a campaign talk.
“ Things are going well with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were going to fight them.
Millions of people would've lost.
But the relationship between us is very good now.
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim were positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he was speaking in this unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“ It is not difficult to act properly, but now there is no 10,000 people out there trying to get in, only about two hundred standing before me, ” said Trump, pointing to the group before.
In Indonesia, hundreds of dead men have the island-floating tsunami and earthquakes
Indonesia has also rejected the aid of international aid organisations after the earthquake in Lomboki.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombs had to be installed, no disaster has been reported at national level and this would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“In more than a number of cases it was very clear that there was no need for international aid, so it is a bit difficult for us to cope with,” said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the setting up of a Palicoable Emergency Team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will really be able to participate in on-site rescues.
According to Sutopo, the National Disaster Agency, the Indonesian agencies are currently carrying out an assessment of the call situation in order to see whether it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is facing the destructive power of nature extremely unprepared.
Although tsunamis were built in Aceh Province, it is not common in other coastal areas.
The manifest lack of the tsunami-signature system in Palu has also contributed to the development of a human life-threatening disaster.
In the Indonesian islands, even at the best time, transport can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombs is on its way to Palu, but for at least three more days before it reaches the affected zone.
President Joko Widodo placed in the centre of his election campaign the development of the Copenhagen infrastructure of Indonesia and did not pay the costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is facing deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the President has to face the ongoing tensions of the parties in Indonesia, since the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had to be killed, and tens of thousands of people had to be put out because of the confusions during which Christian and Muslim gangs had to fall in the streets with moulds, bows, arrows, and other spoiled weapons.

The Parliament Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-recast fever
The exile of the statue could perhaps be a poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and church heritage by the followers of Cromwell and the fanatical puritan.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is “stolerance, ” a “storage of history, ”
According to the President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith: “It was inevitable that, in the current discussions on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace would eventually become a target table.
During the English civil war, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell could be victimized for the record of his previous century chief Thomas's actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell version reflects the opinion of the 19th century and makes a memory of a historical area that has to be celebrated even today.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many people still consider it the protector of external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy in his case.
The fact that this image is indeed accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict that broke out in the middle of the 16th century had an impact on the further development of our nation's fate, and Cromwell is a identifiable person representing one of the sides of this conflict.
And we should celebrate and remember the results that have been achieved as a Lordprotor.
A Chinese farmer for the death of a murdered pig
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in the southwest of China.
On his last name, only a man identified as Yuan was found covered with blood and high blood levels of the pig's market for the town of Liupanshui in Kúcsu Province, reported the case on Sunday by South China Morning Post.
A pig breeding host is preparing to inject pigs in a farm on 30 May 2005 in the province of Xining, China, Province of Csinghai.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jünnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, she found her cousin on the body of a man and discovered that the door to the neighboring pig was open.
It was said that the mouth of the giant candle in the pig's pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found out that it was really the 250-pound pig marta that killed the farmer.
“ My cousin’s feet were bloody, and they were scattered, ” said Guiyang Eventing News only on his last name as Wu.
According to the security cameras, Yuan entered the pigol at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
He was found dead about an hour later.
The animal killing the man wasn't owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The leader of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked away from harming others, while the police were investigating the trails on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities report that the compensation for man's death is currently being negotiated.
Although it does not occur often, pigs have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachustsi and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales put a farmer on his tractor until the man's wife had been strung.
After an oregoni farmer was raised in his own pigs in 2012, a manitobian host spoke about the fact that pigs are not usually prone to attack, but may become aggressive of the taste of blood.
“Very players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt me.
All you have to do is respect them, ” she said.

More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
On the six television channels, over 20 million viewers were interested in the testimonys of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who was accused of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasay Ford.
Meanwhile, the political scene has not been dissolved, and the broadcasters had to cancel the regular program course because of the Friday screw at the last minute: Senator Jeff Flake has managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that he was 100% sure that at a high school party, Kavanaugh took him and tried to get him out.
Kavanaugh's passionate testimony told me that up to 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
The statements from Nielsen over 20.4 million probably saw more viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculates the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPA and Fox Business Network numbers, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is hard to measure the number of people who watch shows at work.
For the purposes of comparison, all the viewers of football players or Oscar payees are used to be.
According to Nielsen, from all the channels, Fox News Channel, who carried out experts for Kavanaugh's appointment, was the highest viewer with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day's hearing.
In the second place, the ABC stands with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3,1, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2.52 million, as reported by Nielsen.
The interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of the moderate Republican senator issued a statement that Senator Kavanaugh would take the Voksa off, the CNN and CBS were seen on Friday morning as the loud mass of the protestors bets, as soon as they were on the elevator to the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
He was looking at the scene while the crowd was suffocating, and CNN broadcasted the scene lively.
\"I'm standing here before you,\" said a woman to the senator.
“ You really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country’s public awareness, ”
Others yelled at him: “You have the power to do things that are not for so many women.
Flake just said that his office had issued a statement and that before the elevator was closed, he would add that he would share what he had to say at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting channels were seen in live hours later, as the committee was voting on whether Kavanaugh's appointment was to be voted on by the whole Senate.
However, Flake said that he was willing to do so only if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate the next week, as the Democrats in the minority called for it.
Flake's discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, have convinced him of this need.
Flake decided on the basis of discussions with Coons and later with other senators.
He exercised his power in accordance with the decision of the Flake, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.

Vulkan will flood Mexico City with ash
The ash shot out of the volcano by Popocatepet reached the southern districts of the capital city of Mexico.
After the volcano activity increased in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash shootings occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre requested the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The centre also observed several moorings and reefs.
The pictures on the Community portal are covered by thin harelets of cars in certain districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.

“We do not forget, we did not forgive, ” the group of slogen scandalous independence groups and the unitary protestors “in front of the life of Spain ” stood against each other for hours.
According to the reports of the local press, 14 people were seen with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
The tension continues to fall in the region of independence as declared illegal by Madrid, but due to the referendum on 1 October celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The voters voted with a large majority in favour of the sale, although the participation rate was rather low, as most of the Unionists have bogged the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people have suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in the polling stations through aggressive conflicts.
The independent party groups were on the street all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent it, the demonstration did not end up on the normal route.
According to Narcis Termes 68-year-old electrician in separatist protests, there is no chance of Katalonia winning independence.
“ One of the best times of our lives is wrong.
I saw my parents take pleasure in voting for us, but by now our cause was painful,” she said.
Although the regional elections last December have succeeded in reaching a significant victory, even if there is a narrow victory, the parties in the Catalan Party of Independence have been able to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have taken a voluntary exile, or are expected to be arrested for the court's judgment on the organisation of referendums and the role played in the post-opportunity cry.
According to the 42-year-old car manager Joan Puig, who recorded a police protest with his phone, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“ The situation is increasingly tense, ” she says.
One of the Catalan leaders who had been waiting for the negotiations since last year, Oriol Junqueras announced that it would start next year in the European Parliament elections.
\"I can thus choose the disparity of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish Government when I take part as candidates in European elections\" said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men driving their cars into a house
The police arrested a 33, 34 and 39-year-old man who used to drive their cars to a house more than once in London.
The case occurred at Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 a.m. summer time.
Detective Bob Blemmings says the gate and the building itself is damaged.
You may have even been shot at the car at a given moment with a number of times.
With Menga's goal, he beat Livingston's Rangers team to 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal is to secure Livingston's victory.
In the first class, Livingston's team recently surprised the Rangers by getting Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working as coach of the ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal meant the real difference because Gary Holt's team got into a dead race with the Hibernian team in the second place.
So the Gerrards continued to remain without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish league, and next Sunday they are facing the first-place Hearts team, with eight points left over.
However, there is still a match for Rangers in the European League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston's six-to-six series of divisios, which means that Kenny Millert's replacement Hol has not yet been awarded with the team last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against the impotently playing guest team
Holt's team could've got the lead right before the only goal of the game, as their attack games have caused little trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the same enemy's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt was wide-ranging after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball in front of the line.
The home team let Rangers play their own game, as they were sure that they could disturb the guests in fixed toys.
The fateful goal was born of exactly one of these situations.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who found it in the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game Rangers led to the same ball management, but domestic protection remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued during the second half of the game, apart from a single situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt at the Rangers' gate, Allan McGregor's on foot, and Lithgow's lost his way out of a new release from Livingston.
There were continuous cross-way balls in Livingston's twelfth, but the defenders were sent every time. Two criminals were not received by the attack team: one Halkett was joined as an exchanger against Glenn Middleton, and the other because of security.
\"Fenomenal – Game from Livingston – Game Analysis
Tony Macaron's Alasdair Lamont, a professor of BBC Scotland
Livingston provided phenomenal performance, and he took off the beans.
Players were one-on-one excellent and have gone beyond expectations.
The team's members and game style have barely changed since they returned to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve a serious recognition, because the coach's training has been very busy with the team since he arrived.
Several players have brought the finest form.
The Haket team captain has created a great deal with the protection of his organization, and Menga was properly shocked by Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they were sometimes under Gerrard's leadership, they just couldn't make that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – otherwise only once did they break down the domestic protection – so Rangers must quickly get themselves together, as they have slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdouan found a mixed reception in Köln
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a pleasure to have a meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, divided by Erdoęn, to improve relations between NATO Member States.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries on issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoęn then traveled to Köln, a newly built ceremony opening a huge match.
The city of Köln provides home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
On the basis of security reasons, the police banned the assembly of the 25 000 people before the show, but many of the President's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Prime Minister.
In addition, hundreds of protestors against Erdoñan, including several Kurds, expressed their rejection of the policy of Erdoñan and the German government's decision to receive the Prime Minister.
The two opposing protests set an excellent example of the proviso of President's policy, which is celebrated as a hero by certain German citizens of Turkish origin, while others see the Autokrat.

Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards were injured during a disturbance
Six prison guards were injured during a man's deep-guarded disturbance in prison, reported to the prison director.
The alarms started at 09:30 on Sunday morning at the Long Lartin penthouse in Worcestershire, and they couldn't be frozen yet.

In Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners are held in prison, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, reports say that the head of prison had to be treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In October last year, there was also a need to help the special development to overcome a serious disturbance, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation of the areas affected by drought may improve)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depression, but it is expected that this is exactly what the state will have to calculate at the beginning of the next week when the residue of the hurricane crosses the name of Rosa crosses the deserted southwest, increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding for Mondays and Tuesdays up to the southern and eastern parts of the Western Arizona and the southern parts of California and Utah; the preparations also affect the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa says you'll go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where you're expected to arrive Monday night and bring great rains with you.
The meteorological service of the phoenix published the following message on Twitter: “From 1950 onwards, ten tropical cycles have arrived in the form of tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile radius ofPhonenix!
The hurricane Katrina, for example, approached the border of Az 40 miles in 1967.
The latest models of the National Hurritcan Centre provide 50 to 100 mm waste, which can also reach 150 mm in extreme cases, for example in the area of Mogolllon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southern desert areas (medium areas of the ski resort, Great Basin etc.), between 25 and 50 mm can be counted as a rainfall, but 100 mm may fall in some places.
The rain brought by Rosa to the areas that have not been threatened by lightning water can reduce, as it is currently affected by severe drought.
Despite the serious danger of flooding, some of the rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the south-west landscapes of the airport.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, over 40% of the territory of Arizona is affected by the minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category, is in the Weather.com report.
The hurricane Rosa will first land on the island of Also-Kalifornia in Mexico.
He continues to be hurricaneed and bringing up to 137 km/h on Sunday morning, about 600 km south of the Mexican Pound Eugenia Earth language, and he will be heading at an equivalent rate of 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
So it is expected that Mexico's shores will be reached again as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or during the evening hours.
It can be counted on raining in certain areas of Mexico, which significantly increases the chances of developing floods.
“The rainfalls can lead to an average drop of 70 to 50 mm from Also-Kalifornia to the north-west of Sonora, where 250 mm of rain can also fall,” says the Weather.com report.
Rosa then goes north of Mexico as a tropical storm before she reached Arizona at Tuesday morning hours, in the form of tropical depression, to travel through Arizona, Tuesday night to the southern areas of Utah.
“The greatest threat caused by Rosa and its remains in Alsó-Kalifornia, Northwest Sonora, and the extraordinary rainfall expected in the desert areas of the southwest of the United States will be,” said the National Hurrikan Centre.
The rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning water and to cause spillages in desert areas, and in mountain areas, it should be kept from earthquakes.

Hundreds of people died in an airfight caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, the number of dead is rising.
A lot of people have lost their lives, and at least 384 people have lost their lives when giant waves have reached the shore. The disaster has caused a strong earthquake and escape on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported on Saturday by local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered together at the festival held in Palu on Friday, when the high waves of nearly six meters (18 feet) were suburbed, many went down, and all that was destroyed in their path.
The escape route was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the escape warning was voiced yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not escape from one side, so the waves became a victim, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB) at the Jakartai press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come in you, cars, cabins, houses, and all the other people were drifting from the beach, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was at 800 km/h in the open sea before it reached the beach.
Some of them climbed from the price to the top of the trees, and they escaped, he said.
About 16 700 people have been evacuated for 24 shelters, please.
At the air shots published by the Agency from disaster, several destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a water-cracked case.
On Saturday, further exorcisms were struck by the coastal city.
The earthquakes could be detected in an area of around 2.4 million people live in.
According to the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) declaration, 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the atom bomb that was dropped to Hirosima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical characteristics could confirm the impact of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was “representable, ” thousands of homes were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were collapsing.
Several victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and he added that the number of injured persons was up to 540, and they were looking for 29 more.
Nugroho’s statement says that in the coastal region of Palu 300 km (190 miles), the number of injured people in the area known as Dongela could be even higher, as it was closer to the epicentrum of the earthquake.
Communication “has been completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained from Donggala,” said Nugroho.
“ Over 30,000 people live there, ” says the Red Cross in which they announced that the experts and volunteers of the organization are already on their way to the disaster area.
“ The situation is already tragic, but even worse, ” they added.
The Agency received many criticisms on Saturday about the fact that he did not inform the public about the fire storm in Palut, but the board said that the waves had already reached the shore while the alarm was being issued.
In an amateur recording on social sites, you can see a man who tries to warn people on the street with desperate calls from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes there will be a huge waterfall on the coast, driving cars and buildings.
The Reuters News Office has not been able to prove the authentication of the recording yet.
The earthquake and the escape price caused a loss of power, unsatisfied communication in Palu, so the authorities are also making it harder to coordinate rescue work.
The military transport of air cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential needs articles.
The city airport was opened only in order to facilitate aid work and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian fountain exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team safely arrived from Donggala to Palu, where employees found shelter under the tents set up in the courtyard of the office, but they met the tracks of terrible destruction during their journey, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed, ” he added.
- It's a very bad situation.
While aid teams included the preparation of disaster response work, some complained that foreign professionals with great experience in this area could not travel.
According to Indonesian regulations, aid, aid and staff from all sea borders can only be allowed into the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared a disaster-related area at national level.
That didn't happen until then.
“The case continues to be treated as a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arrian, one of the spokespersons of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– As the government acknowledges, it is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services, but there has been no announcements yet.
On the second night after Friday's uprising and escape, I ask the friends and family members of the missing ones to continue to hope that they will also be loved by those whose escape of the miracle is a little light on natural disasters.
On Saturday, rescue work, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, workers managed to get rid of a woman who had to spend two days next to her mother's body under the ruins.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parasitic team, prepared two competitions for Asian games that were completed at the beginning of the month, which were held this time in Indonesia.
Apart from the missing ones, there were other disciples in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“ As a watering umbrella, what happened to me was a great spiritual burden, ” she said.
Gendon recalled that when the news from the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread between the paratroopers, he was desperate for hours to reach the contestants at WhatsApp who were just participating in the beach festival.
In addition to the messages, only one gray pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered, ” he said.

So it's you and me, and we're all one.
Kanye means it's the only one and only Ye, which represents the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album would rather reflect who we are, in fact, “
Ye is one of the famous rappers who will change their names in advance.
Sean Combs, for example, has been running under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that Love and Brother Love are now promoting names.

The US should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the support for such research, reported Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and adapter of artificial intelligence solutions that previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He then said that the United States Government had announced artificial intelligence, even though the US did not have official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
\"The double-out of the MI cost framework would be an appropriate start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US, and the next breakthrough in MI territory – said Lee.
By doubled the possibility that the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence could be taken by the United States, said CNBC in the interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month in Houghton Mufflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies in China with MI, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on a MI system that managed to defeat the best U.S. Othello player and later acted as a member of Microsoft Research and as president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the technological competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the results of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when such an event would be organised, because it would be possible to explore new futures.
researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the state aid needed for their research, said Lee.
“ China does not cut off scientific leaders, but large companies, ” he added.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have over the past few years signed up for several major university skulls to work in MI.
According to Lee, the amendment to immigration policy could also help the US's aspirations in artificial intelligence.
“I think that you should receive a green card automatically for those who have a doctorate degree in the field of artificial intelligence, ” he said.
The Chinese Council of State announced in July 2017 its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science base provides support to academic institutions in a similar way, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the Department of Defence established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI centre, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently makes $100 million a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America, which planned to set up a National Security MI committee, has not taken any further steps for the purpose of this case for months.
There is a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name
The population of Macedonia, in the Sunday referendum, was wondering whether the country's name would be changed to ‘the Republic of Mexico’, with this step moving on to solve a decade-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the acceptance of the country's EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, one of its provinces, was called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is a need for a Greek area called the same, and so far it has protected the NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments have negotiated the new name of the state, but according to national emotional opponents, the ethnic identity of the majority of the population in Macedonia would be subject to nominal change.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the launch of the bojkotkampány, he doubted whether there would be a 50% participation rate for the current referendum.
The question on voting parties is as follows: ‘Does the country support NATO and EU membership and whether it adopts the agreement with Greece’.
The supporters of the roll-over, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for in order to be one of the countries raised in the ruins of Macedonia, the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country so that Macedonia’s young people can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska (79).
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, sufficient Members have announced that they are bound by the outcome of the vote.
We need two thirds of the majority in Parliament to change names.
According to the State Elections Committee, no statement of irregularities has been received by 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% so far. This value was 34% for 2016 parliamentary elections (which was finally 66% for registered voters).
“ For the sake of my children, I came to vote because of our place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who gave up his vote in Scopa, the capital city.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and son, Duskko, have taken over their Voks in Strumica, the referendum of 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO bonds.
In the synagogue before the Parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and set chairs and tents for the referendums.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but proudly, we want to join up with a raised head and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, you can also turn to China or Russia as part of the European integration: \"
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO can be counted with investments in Macedonia that the country with higher unemployment than 20% needs.
“I think that the majority will support our case, as more than 80% of the country’s population is essentially in favour of EU and NATO membership,” said Zaev, after voting.
He also added that the \"yes\" vote means \"the guarantee of the future of the country\".
According to a survey published last seven Monday by the political research institute in Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the necessary participation rate.
Based on another survey made by Macedón Telma TV, 57% of the participation rate is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% of them said they'd be able to do yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least one vote by more than 50%.
The validity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government, which was taken over in May last year.

Scherzer wants to make the Rockies difficult.
Since the Nationals team missed the possibility of getting into the retirement season, they had no reason to really push on.
However, Scherzer, the always competitive spirit, is looking forward to standing on Sundays against Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play the game.
The Rockies have assured you at least one place of comfort by winning the 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first address in Division is still waiting for you.
“Even though we no longer have a chance, we can argue against them that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be on the roof of the year.
Of course, I'm in the mood to stand on track like this.
The Nationals team still needs to select the beginner by Sunday, but news says Scherzer will be the drummer in this situation.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The president is also covering the situation surrounding the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done so far is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of our most important choices in life.
This is one of the greats, and I am not going in person, but I am actually leaving, so I am going everywhere to support the best candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “All of you can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can take any means to regain power, see evil and humility.
It doesn't matter who they're hurting, who they're going to take to control, they have power, that's what they want, governance and power, but we don't leave ourselves.
According to the president, the Democrats are putting in place the 'prevention and obstruction'.
“They could have seen all this in the last four days, ” he said, “begined and evil - minded and low - and lying, calling the Democrats.
According to the name, she mentioned Senator Danne Feinstein's Democrat, a member of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, which was declared to be the voice of the assembled mass.
“Do you remember what he answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, uh, no, wait, wait, all this with a very bad body talk, that was the worst body talk I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It's not tolerated by those who speak freely what they think.
I wasn't surprised when the activists of Momentum in my party decided on my censorship.
Finally, I am only the last in the long line of worker representatives who have been informed that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has been treated like this because he was unsatisfied against anti-semitism.
In my case, I didn't like the fact that I didn't understand one with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the invitation of the working party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, they said that they would like to have “a spirit and productive meeting. ”
In most of my eight years as local representatives of the Labour Party, these meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, however, there has been a change of voice, and the promise of a more polite, policy has come to an end if it has ever been achieved.
It is even more noticeable that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether the party's leadership is acceptable.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude have been waiting for them to turn their backs on my individual opinion, and I would also take a position with which I would never agree, on national security matters or on the single European market.
After all my public speeches, whether I actually said what I said, they're going to start kissing on social issues, they're going to demand my resignation, criticise me for the policy that leads to the middle, and they're telling me that I shouldn't even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the contributions I have received are usually focused on politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to attack sexual and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of our politics is that attacks at this level have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to support the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have abandoned the diversity and all the “non-trust” initiatives and all the changes to the electoral rules are increasingly narrowed in the party.
Over the past few years, many have advised me not to be so synonymous, and then “it will be all right ”
But that's not why I took a political course.
32 years ago, even as a student, I joined the Labour Party because the Thatcher government was so desperate for schools that our classroom was almost choked and then I fought for a better approach to the most deprived of both local counsellor and government minister.
I've never hidden my political views under the word, and I didn't do anything else during the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was quite clear to all of us what political positions I represent and which I disagree with current leadership.
For those who have supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation when the country goes towards a Brex which is not only for families, but for companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy on my question of loyalty to the Head of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not about the members of Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, regardless of whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that there will be no change or political threat of any kind because of my own judgment and of everyone's interests.
Chris Leslie, representative of Nottingham East
Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr is uncomplicated at the top
Two late attempts have slightly changed in the same outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worthy of victory at the most amusing match of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently on top of the table, one of the ten teams is the only one without a beating.
Thanks to their unsatisfied defence and modest situation, they have won, so they have every reason to be satisfied with the natives and coach Peter Murchie.
“We had to meet a huge challenge during our games, but we are still invincible, so I have every reason to be happy, ” she said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made a much better use of his situation than we have.
With Grant Anderson's experiment in 14 minutes, from which Frazier Climo did the point, Ayr got to the advantage. Thanks to the yellow card from the Warriors, which led to the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, Melrose could have towered the difference, but Jason Baggot did not get a point.
Climo had a penalized defense of Ayr, just in half-time, and then obtained a single-person trial, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results in Ayr's favor.
Melrose started the second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagget, reducing the group's disadvantage to five points.
The game stood for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to take it off the track, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose beans had been hit with Climo's work.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also got a yellow card, and Melrose was able to stop Bruce Colvine's experiment in a homicide, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to close again, and when Stuan Hutchinson got a yellow card for putting Clilo down, MacPherson, from the penalty line, he introduced a touch down behind the Ayr assault team.
Climo sold what he repeated almost immediately after the re-start, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry a shot at the fifth attempt at home.
The main role of Still Game started a new career in the catering industry
It appears that one of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it was discovered that a restaurant was led by a company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis is playing in the popular BBC series, which is written together and where he's working with his old commist Greg Hemphhill.
The couple announced that the next nine will be your final year, and it seems Kiernan's already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he became Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from the fishy catering industry of Glasgow.
“The sea is ours,” says Bolivia, without the beach, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific.
Marines are patrolling the sailing station around La Paz.
The ocean flags in the midlands are sinking.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon advertise the following myth: “We are on the way to the sea.
It is our duty to recover
In Bolivia without a beach, the memories of the lost coast are still alive, taken by Chile in a blood conflict of the 19th century for resources, and the desire to re-establish the Pacific waves is strong.
These hopes may have been the most powerful thing for decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the first five years of the October judgment of the International Court of Justice to be closed.
“There is a ball at your brother’s house that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, who are in a positive mood, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat in Bolivia.
A large number of Bolivians are following the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that it will stand by Bolivia, and Chile will be required to sit at a negotiating table after several decades of rapsodistic attitudes to get Bolivia to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a conflicting fight to continue for the next year's re-election, can lose much by Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” announced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and that would not change a lot if its decision was positive for Bolivia.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands has no right to judge the Chilean territories and has also foreseen that it will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about just six months after the final statements, indicates that the case was “not complicated, ” said Paz Zárte, an expert in international law.
In addition, for the past four years, he hasn't helped Bolivia, but he even put it back.
“The issue of the exit of the sea has been addressed by the current government of Bolivia for its own purposes,” said Zate.
“ Due to the hostile rhetoric of Morales, the rest of the Chileans have taken off, ”
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue after what has happened.
Since 1962, both countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, Member of Bolivia, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually rapid.
Monday for Bolivia, it gives us a \"excessive opportunity to open a new chapter in the relations with Chile,\" and the chance to come out of “of the end of the conflict of 135 years, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to bring about a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” added.
“ The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond what has happened in the past, ”
North Korea: No nuclear disposal until they can trust America
According to the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho, the country will not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to observe the promises made to the leaders of the two rival countries at the summit in Singapore.
The comment was made when it seemed that Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, was able to re-start the failed nuclear negotiations for more than three months after the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Dzongun.
According to Ri, “I urge you to believe that the US inhibition of continuous sanctions and a declaration closing the Korean war will never be enough to force North Korea on your knees.
Washington is changing from acceptance of the statement if Phenjan doesn't take any significant steps towards disposing.
All Kim Jsongun and the American President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, wide-ranging skepticism calls for Phenjan's commitment to the removal of the arsenal, which is likely to be the sole key to the country's safety.
Pompeo is planning a phenjani visit for the next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
In Paris fashion shows, there's the huge head cover that'll soon appear in top-class shops.
If you want to expand your hat collection or you want to fully cover the day, you don't have to look for it anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headfloors as part of their Spring/Sunning Collection in 2019, which was accepted by the stylish audience in Paris with great enthusiasm.
No practical hats were identified as sensations on Instagram during the summer, and the above fashion designers also set their attention to the project.
Valentino's most impressive piece was a oversized beige hat, which is penile, wide karma decorated and almost completely swallowed the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements, the greasy Greek dunes, a magic hat, and even an ananas, which were not really designed to keep the man's head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a bizarr mask choice, even just in time before Halloween.
Some of the colored masks had their mouth sewn together, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than the haute country.
One of these was like a diver mask with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting cane ice cream.
If you have these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The style parameters can predict that the huge hats are on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path “La Bomba”, a large-scale cardboard of 60 cm wide from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the social sides showed another piece of the runway: a beach bag made of apples, almost as much as the bathrobe that holds it.
The dark orange rape bag – which is decorated by raps, and on top of it there is a white leather coat – one of the outstanding pieces of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus in spring/Sunday 2019 was on the Paris fashion week.
The star's stlist, Luke Armitage, declared to FEMAIL: “I expect that by the summer of the year, huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top-class clothing shops.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The situation did not change to 2018, which is further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other Community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students are already studying such institutions as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are seeking to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, it gets to your head.
But if you speak in his tongue, it gets to his heart.
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations and trust with other countries.
The research results this year show that students from independent schools have brought the best results from foreign languages throughout the country.
68 percent of all students studying foreign languages reached a higher level A (more than 85 percent result).
Based on the data collected from SCIS 74 member schools, 72 percent of students received a higher degree from Mandarin, and 72 percent of German students, 69 French and 63 percent of Spanish students reached Level A.
These results also support the fact that Scotland's independent schools consider foreign languages as an essential knowledge of which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as elected objects have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other types of schools.
The 2014 survey of the UK Committee on Employment and Vocational Training revealed that 17 percent of employers say that the filling of empty positions is difficult due to the lack of language knowledge.
We can also see that learning language becomes increasingly necessary to enable young people to pursue a successful career.
As learning foreign languages is becoming more and more jobs, language knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he has learned foreign language, he will gain a lifelong knowledge of which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities provides an automatic competitive advantage to those who speak in several languages.
According to the survey of YouGov, which asked 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not well enough in any foreign language to speak to others, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15%).
Therefore, it is important that we focus on teaching the children the language.
In several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, it can be a tool for children with a better chance of finding important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, all schools will have other languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarins or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance for the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the interest of the child, you can learn more optional languages at independent schools, and you will be trained by teachers who are experts in your field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares them and provides them with the skills they need to succeed, to keep anything to the future.
It is not difficult to note that languages are still vital for the future of a country in the global business environment, and that education must also reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools offer the option of choice, diversity and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – that's how it must be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron performs in San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
You don't have to wait much longer for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James in the colors of Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play the premiere Sunday opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna spend on the field, that's a questionable one.
“ More than one and less than 48, ” wrote Walton on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers scientist, Mike Trudell, said that James would probably only play for a limited amount of time.
After a couple of days of training, James was asked what his plans were with Lakers in the six-mix season.
“I don’t have to play at this point in my career in the early season to be ready, ” she replied.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia and YouTube's channel
Donald Trump Wheeling, West Virginia, starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be Trump's first, including stops such as Tenssee and Mississippi, coming from his five-weekly events next week.
Now that the vote to confirm the candidate for the seat of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to collect supporters for the next half-time elections on the line, as there is a danger that the Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump start today's Western Virginia event, and where can you follow online?
The speech by Trump Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) begins today at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can also be monitored online through YouTube's live mediation.
Trump is likely to be involved in the hearing of the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh this week, which proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote was suspended for not more than one week until the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the sudden breeding events is to help the Republicans' situation before the November elections.
According to Trump’s campaign advisor, next week’s five events serve the activation of voters and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that are currently held in the Senate and the House of Representatives, says Reuters.
“In order to be able to control Congress in his hand, the president is so critical of his political plans to visit as many states as possible. We look at it as a busy campaign period,” he reported to Reuters a campaign speaker asking for his name.
The Wheeling Wesbanco Arena planned this evening event “Ohio and Pennsylvania states can bring support and even be included in the media reports in Pittsburgh,” states West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for the West Virginia Republic, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the surveys, is not in a good position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey to be personally involved in the surveys, ” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team has a full range of struggle before Sunday individuals to keep their hope alive
After three unilateral attempts on Saturday afternoon four matches, Ryder needed much.
The shirt of luck and moment here is a sport concept obtained from a rather air, yet all players believe in it, mostly during competitions such as Ryder Cup.
So, who's got the ball?
“ They had a six-point drive, and there are only four of them, so we can say that we have the ball, ” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, four points are still Europe's leading, and it can still be obtained by twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they've finally got a little back wind, and they can encourage more than anything, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both got three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The cry of Öblös victory has become more and more loud, as he went forward with the circle, hit a critical turn and settled in the fourth game, so that after two he and Thomas were in double disadvantages.
The swinging of the game resulted in a similar exhilaration to the 15th hole, a kind that can believe that the American team has not lost everything yet.
“ You just have to dig deep in yourself, and only take care of your own game, ” she said.
That's exactly what's waiting for players.
18 holes for a chance to leave a trail.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the best partner in Ryder Cup, could get more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's odd but worshipable couple made four out of four, and it seems they can't make mistakes.
“Moliwood, ” was the only couple who did not perform the parade on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning in the last nine stages of similar performance.
Thanks to the dynamics of this series and amongst them and among them, they became the poison by Sunday, and no one expects the sun to guarantee Europe's victory on the Le Golf National Course as Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing to do would be a win at a single, different holes.
However, it is still early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning, when Alex played with Noren.
Once with one and two blows above the bar, the Spanish and Swedish were filled with the first nine holes, which put them in a wave valley, where they had no chance to climb.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your pit.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are extremely entertaining, thanks to the interaction of the couple. You can look out for what advice you will not give and how the strategy can change during a glance.
Europe has played a better team and has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section 4 has shown that the American team has the need for the fight, while many of them, especially from the American side.
Europe begins its last day of Ryder with a 10-6 advance
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup by closing the match on Saturday with four balls and four matches with 10-6 results against the United States.
The speedy Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the bow, two winnings against the vulnerable Tiger Woods, thereby raising the difference at four points on the Le Golf National Course.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to get back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US team that is constantly failing during the four-ball fights in the morning, winning 3-1-.
America has shown greater resistance during the Fouries, bringing two games, but they couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the Sunday 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who, after a sensational weekend, only speak “Melliwood” as the second couple of the history of the Ryder Cup, who gained four points in four opening matches.
After they beat the Woods-Patrick Reed in four battles, they beat the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. novel, Bryson Dechambeau's twins to a decisive 5 out of 7 out of 4.
Woods, who attracted himself to two games on Saturday, he sometimes made up his talent, but from 29 games he lost 19 of four balls and fours, seven of them in turn.
Justin Rose, who rested during the fourballs of the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours he defeated the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third position of the World Bank.
However, Europe has not succeeded in all of this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time address guard Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturday's two points showed the Americans how to do this.
A two-to-one victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter pair was won in four battles, and later they returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in fours after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder-kupa's history, only twice a team managed to come back from a four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's address team has enough to keep a trophy.
However, after being only the second best for two days, one Sunday counterattack seems to be unrealistic.
‘It is not possible for North Korea to fall unilaterally if they do not trust its negotiating partner.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister announced that maintaining sanctions only increased the lack of confidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho told us at the annual Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken significant and high-level steps in the last year, for example, to stop nuclear and missile experiments, to close nuclear trials, and promised not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“ However, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in America, we feel that the safety of our nation is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances it is impossible to be unilaterally and first set off, ”
Although Ri once again expressed the disappointment of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to the idea of \"serious\" nuclear disposal, which, according to the scenario, would receive North Korea's reward for the actions that had been taken so far, its statement seemed important, because it did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disposal as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint declaration made by Kim Dzongun and Donald Trump at the first summit between a dominant American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, and in which Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disposal of the Korean peninsula” until Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to make an official point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but according to the United States of America, Phenjan needs to give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not allow strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“American insists that we start nuclear deportation and increase the pressure by sanctions to force our will, and also protest against the declaration of war closure,” said Ri.
– The idea of imposing sanctions on us is a desire for people who do not know us.
The problem is that non-serious sanctions only increase our suspicion –
Ri did not mention that it would be planned for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, the President of the United Nations gave a separate speech at the beginning of the week.
Rather, the minister pointed out that there were three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Dzsein in the last five months and said: “If the country involved in nuclear disposal were South Korea, not the United States of America, the nuclear disposal of the Korean peninsula would not have occurred in such a situation,”
However, Ri’s speech was dramaticly different from last year’s time when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the aim of the North American continent was inevitable with North Korea’s missiles, after Trump, “the evil President, Kim, a rocket man, ” called himself a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with total destruction last year, threatened with praise that he has the courage to take steps towards decomposition, but also noted that there was still a lot of work to be done, and sanctions will remain until North Korea has completed nuclear disposal.
On Wednesday Trump said that they did not impose a time limit, i.e. “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter, ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
In contrast, U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday at the UN Security Council: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be complied with unsatisfied until we have reached the actual, final, proven nuclear deportation –
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ríl at the end of the UN General Assembly, and then said he was going back to Pyongan to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, however, North Korea later accused him of “ghectronic claims” being raised.
In the framework of the meeting with Munn this month, North Korea promised to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility, if the United States is to take sufficient steps to:
According to Mun, the steps mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump has announced in Singapore or steps that could lead to normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
The Harvard students are taught to rest enough
This year, the Harvard University had a new study of students with more sleep, fighting against the culture of the cat that won space through caffeine.
A academic came to the conclusion that students of the world's first university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, according to which the first such training was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler in the United States, who taught sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College, is a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He encouraged the course to draw up a presentation earlier on the impact of sleeping on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked: ‘Why do I only face this as a senior?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised him, “He told Telegraph. ”
During the first course this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep habits on their educational and sports performance, not only on their general public but also on their positive impact.
According to Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and Director at the University's Health Service, the university decided to launch the course because during the week students found it extremely unscrupulous.
The one-hour course also includes a number of interactive tasks.
For example, one example shows a picture of a college room where students can click on the coffee cup, curtains, gymnastics and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, by the effect of sport performance on incompetence, and why it is important for the rest of the world.
In another part, it is reported to participants how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present a map of interactive icon in the university's territory to allow participants to think about the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change students’ behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to these knowledge, as they have the right to know the health effects of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which performance is meant to go through one night said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students is constantly increasing, resulting in increased sleepiness.
Sufficient and high-quality sleep protects students from “scientific weapons ” in the fight of stress, fatigue and anxiety, even obesity, as sleep loss forces them to hunger in the brain and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop his course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysical, and last year Harvardon took one of the professor's courses.
He said that the people who heard him opened his eyes and encouraged him to sword him while he was starting a university training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training programme before they are located in the competition area.
Professor Czeisler suggested that the students set a warning to bed, a alarm to wake up and to learn about the harmful effects of electric screens and LED light sources, which could easily reduce them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult for them to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and he's got a go.
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb Steven Gerrard slipped his team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxs tried to get their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory in February, St. Johnstone, but Gerrard's second defeat was taken from Gary Holt's team in 18 games as manager, so that there will be eight points left from the first position of the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish championship), the Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before midtime, and Rangers' unmotivated team wasn't even close to the equation.
While Rangers fell to sixth place, Livingston got caught up in the third place, just missing from Hibernia because of the difference.
Rangers may face further difficulties after a medical treatment due to the head injuries of Calum Spence is required due to the presence of an object dropped from the sight of the guests.
Gerrard turned eight points on the team that came into the premiere of Ayr.
Holt got into the field with the same 11 people from Livingston who picked up a point from Hearts last week and would certainly have looked happy, just like his set team had shattered his opponent's game where he could find it.
Although Rangers led the ball, Livingston took it to more than what he got.
The first two minutes they could have obtained a goth when Menga launched Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor, but the middle court couldn't sell the bag.
Keaghan Jacobs' low release landed at Craig Halkett's team captain, but his protector Alan Lithgow only found the side of the gate.
Rangers took control of it, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he was worthy of a penitentiary at the 15th minute when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson was able to overcome his claims in Colombia.
The Rangers had only two first-time capura shots, but the former ibrox gate, Liam Kelly, had hardly caused a problem with Lassana Coulibally's head and the weak shooting of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute faced the game until then, no one can deny that they deserve the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers has re-suspensioned a mule forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who found Menga well for easy ending.
Gerrard decided at the break, Coulibally replaced Ryan Kentre, and this almost immediately revealed his influence on the game when the extreme Morelost was jumping, but the impressive form of Kelly was blocked in time.
Livingston continued to get to play a game that was good for him, and Lithgow and Halkett were sneaking up the long balls.
Holt's team could have had a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good hold of the net and hit Jacobs before Lithgow was in a corner.
The Glenn Middleton, acting as the Rangers exchange, tried to fight another eleven when he got into trouble with Jacobs, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
One detail, “day of the morning, morning, ” from our almanach: September 30, 1882, right now, just 136 years... is the day when the later physics, John Wilhelm-Hans, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that could have been created by a tool known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counting has been one of the basics of science, and thanks to the 1950s, strange cowboys, Roy Rogerst and Dale Evanst film, \"Bells of Coronado\" (Coronado bells) has become part of the pop culture:
Man: “What is this?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be found.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: “Hold on, it's a bit of a sin,”
“Hans – Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he lives on the invention of a woman who wears a name.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be obtained from the patient and then changed to a laboratory.
Thus, they can “see ” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immune cells are repressed into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect abnormal cells could have had a say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the recovery of immune cells from the patient; it is modified in the laboratory to ‘see ’ the protein called HER2, which is a frequent accompanying agent for multiple cancers; then reinstate the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the National Institute for Cancer (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting and teaching immune cells is the way they can attack cancer cells, previously used to treat one of the types of leukaemia.
The Kanye West SNL role of the MAGA-sapka has been at the summit of a Trumpot-sponsored tirad.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye Westet was bathed in the Saturn Night Live studio after an inconsistent revelation of the American President Donald Trump, and he announced that he would apply for the president's post in 2020.
After she played her third song on the titled hat of Make America Great Again that night, Ghost Town, she began to speak against the Democrats and again stressed Trumpot was in favour of it.
“Sometimes, when I speak to someone who is white, asks the question: ‘How do you like Trumpot, as racist?’
If you were interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, ” she said.
Matt Damon's SNL program was opened with a parodia, in which Brett Kavanaugh, the Hollywood star, who had a confession before the Senate Justice Committee, was in charge of the sexual harassment charges of Christine Blasay Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video from West was uploaded by Chris Rock's humorist to social sites.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to drive us from West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was behind the scenes because of his hat.
\"They were scared behind the scenes.
They said: “Do not go out in that hat.”
They scared me!
And they said that I was in the sunken place, ” said Washington Eximiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a place that's inside? I'm wearing my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His manifestations were at least twice haunted by the audience, and the members of the SNL were apparently embarrassed by one of the eyewitness witnesses to Variety: “The whole studio was mute in silence, ”
They called Westet Ariana Grande instead of her singer at the last moment, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller rapper died a few days before.
In other words, West asked questions when he made his song I Love it dressed as Perrier glasses.
Westet, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, provided support for Candace Turner in a chat: “One of the bravest spirits: THE COURSE OF THE HOUSE OF THE COURSE
Karen Hunter, the host of a conversation program, said that West was simply “a man, and this was great. ”
“But I chose not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashion articles or the support of his “artist”), who I believe is a ideology that is harmful to the community that I belong to.
He's free.
But we, too, have done so.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West, ”
He's not the first artist who changed his name, and that's why he put me in the prints of Diddy, who we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg, also picked up the name of Snoop Lion, and of course his late legend, Prince also changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
He's charged with a human murder attempt at the Belgian restaurant.
A 45-year-old man is charged with a human murder attempt after a man was found in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the case was in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the City Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the D.A.
Kit Harington, the star of the Trorns fighting, finds excessive maleity harmful.
Kit Harington is mostly known as Jon Snow, and in the fantasy series of HBO, which is full of violence, you are often stuck in sword.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke against the stereotipic cat heroes, highlighting that, as such heroes see, little boys often feel that hard action is necessary to overcome respect.
Kit stated in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he ‘ had gone wrong ’ and asked the question of how the problem of the harmful effects of over-manhood in the #MeToo era could be addressed.
The star who recently married her 31-year-old, serial colleague, Rose Leslie, said she thought it would be very important to treat the problem.
“I personally am deeply affected by this matter, how has this manhood been distorted? ” asked the actor.
– What have we taught men in their childhood about the problem we are facing?
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of manhood, as the shows often feature very Masculine characters.
He continued to add: “What is what we are born with, and what is what we learn?
What does the street and TV tell young boys that they feel they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions that we are dealing with – and how we can change this.
Because it's obvious that something isn't right with young men.
Who in the interview said that after the summer season in the series, the Trorns will not be included in the Harca history series or operations because “he has the spirit of battles and horses ”
From November to the reprocessing of his film Sam Shepard True West, he will play a major role in the reprocessing of a producer and his prisoner's lifestyle.
The actor told me that the best thing he's ever had to fight the throne was his wife, Rose, who he knew during the show.
“I met my wife at the shooting, so I thanked my future family and my life ahead of me for the show, ” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was the character of Kit, Jon Snow had his love for the Emmy Award fantasy series.
The couple married Leslie's family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: In China, the number of new patients increased by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14% in the country.
Health officials say that this represents more than 820 000 people.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared to earlier, a significant number of newly infected people are sexually infected.
The disease previously spread rapidly in some parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in the Province of Jünna said that the number of such cases has been almost zero since then.
Nevertheless, the number of HIV and AIDS people in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Transfer of HIV sexually is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong since then.
On the basis of estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men finally marry women because of the conservative value order of the country.
In many cases, the disease spreads due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his crew would have leaked Republican senators' data and condemned “serious lies, ” and“ conspiracy theory. ”
On Saturday, U.S. MP Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal data on the website of the senators’ Wikipedia.
According to the representative of the Los Angeles Democrat, the claims in question were distributed by experts and websites.
“ Lying, lying, and more sleepy lies, ” wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to include the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch utah.
The information has been published on Thursday. Your disclosure person is unknown, but it is certain that they were published on the Capitol domb during the Senate hearing on the sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh's supreme legal candidate.
The leak wasn't long after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, according to Gateway Pundit and RedState, can be linked to the Waters office of the IP address identified as source, and have also reported information about one of the members of Waters' staff, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying,” continued Waters.
My staff has no responsibility for leaking information. However, his right to anonymism, personal data protection and security has been injured as a result of fraud and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and I obviously lie.
Waters' statements on the Internet were quickly criticised, including Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial – written by Fleischer.
– On this basis, Waters does not have a blood temperature required for the representative's office.
If someone gets upset with something he didn't commit, he can't respond angry.
You can't act like shit.
You can't question the defendant's motive.
You need to stay calm and calm.
Waters' reaction to the reaction of Fleischer apparently compared the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to party criticisms, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the role of Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“ If true, it is serious, ” he wrote.
Waters in his communication said that his office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies in the matter of false charges.
“We look forward to the identification of the perpetrators, who continued Waters, and to be legally liable for all acts that endanger or damage any member of the staff, ”
Johnny English will strike again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralysing spy game
Today, we are looking for references to Brexit in every British film, and there can be no exception to this category of action games/paródia, the first part of which, the second part of Johnny English 2003 and the second part of Johnny English reloaded in 2011.
Will the British nation become a new export product for the sarcastic, paradorating satirs in which we are living on our own, obvious paralytics?
So much as it is clear that the trash was an incompetent Johnny English with enough ammunition to return – it is already from its name that this commic character was created to make the world's population of non-English national cinemas laugh on it.
Johnny English, of course, is a hidden secret agent who thinks he's a winner of the bizarr's moor, so he reminds a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Beanre, and, at the same time, at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics with a single button printing.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV, once since then, and left chaos everywhere.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English film.
I loved it, like Johnny English, dressed in a medieval armor, nearing a helicopter, and then, for a few moments, the rotors knocked on his helmet.
Akinson's commic vein is well in practice in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it also affects itself, because nowadays, such as James Bond movies or the Mission Imposible series are firmly touched by the humor device.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English's smart, left-handed adventures do not reach the level of idealism and genius that Akinson brings in the silent scenes of Mr. Bean's series.
The starting point of the film is hereditary: Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber criminal broke into the super secret network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest horror of the client agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, only had a small role in the film.
This may be the last angle to the coffin of the Prime Minister, whose political popularity is still in ruins: Emma Thompson practically transforms Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poor-written character.
The intelligence advisors advise him that, as all active agents have been exposed, he must set up a restful agent for work.
This restless agent, of course, is no different from the two-headed Johnny English who has worked as a teacher at a pre-school since his withdrawal, but he teaches children to spy differently from the study material – there are, of course, funny scenes here, while he describes the basics of spying in English as a \"Rocksuli\" mode.
English is quickly delivered to Whitehall, where the emergency briefing meets again with his former, much-deprived weapons carrier, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and married the captain of a submarine, whose mouth is always open, the captain of Vicki Pepperdine, who called for much better roles.
So his Majesty’s national security service will return to action by two-headed “Batman and Robin ” and face Ophelia Bulletov, who is made by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a true woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is becoming increasingly involved in the charismatic IT billionaire, who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Great Britain: his name is Jason Volta and Jake Lacy is developing.
English and Bough will begin their clown mission: they will fire a naked French restaurant by disguised as a waiter, and then in the middle of an amazing turn they will smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English will actually release the hell when you try to get to know Volta's apartment using a VRhead.
These stations need us to get to the end of this development, but they have managed to make any fun and turn around, and maybe they're making a little too much impression of a child movie.
The outcome is quite medium.
As with all the other Johnny English film, I have a question: couldn't the British film industry finally play a giftable role for Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party denies it to introduce a four-day work week job while paying the British for a five-day job
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft: four-day working week, all of which would be working for five-day wages.
The party is supposed to want workers to also benefit from the benefits of the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution in order to provide workers with an extra day of leave thanks to increased income.
Based on the draft, workers would have a three-day weekend while taking me home the same as before.
According to the sources, the idea of a party would be an economic programme aimed at reducing the country's balance language to the side of the workers.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Congress of Trade Organisations, so that workers can profit from the changing economy.
One of the leading officials in the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to the next, the working week of the four days is an idea that fits the party's programme, which would move the balance language towards the workers in the economy, including the party's comprehensive industrial strategy.
It would not be the first working party to support such an idea, the Green Party was already campaigned at the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
However, the idea does not enjoy supporting the Labour Party as a whole.
He said: “The four-day working week work week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the question is not even on the agenda.
At the last week's Labour Party conference, Mr John McDonnell, Minister for Foreign Affairs, presented his idea of socialist revolution on the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to fight to regain power from “the unscrupulous directors ” and from“ the beneficiaries of the regime ”
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of water supply companies would not be able to recover their total profits, since a Labour Party government would \"takes\" as a punishment for the harmful activities that it has suffered.
McDonnell also confirmed that, according to his plans, he would also be a member of the Board of Directors and would create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, thus providing an important dividend of 500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced on the “60 Minutes” show whether the FBI print on Kavanaugh could change their opinion
As a result of the FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of Mr Kavanaugh to the Supreme Judge will be held at least one week after the original date. Ask whether the outcome of the investigation may unconfirmed the Republican representatives so much that Kavanaugh will not be supported.
In his interview with Scott Pelley, journalist John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham Republican senators asked if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed less committed than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I understand, of course,” said Kennedy.
– That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the case broke up, and I asked him, \"Did you do it?\"
His answer was firm and clear.
However, Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I need very serious accusations to change my mind,” Graham said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett has thoroughly denied the claims – he added Graham, Christine Blasay Ford.
- And none of the people named by Dr. Ford proved the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new is going to happen.
What is the Global Civil Festival, and has it been able to reduce poverty?
Saturday begins in New York, the annual music event, the Global Civil Festival. World stars take place at the festival to stand for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Civil Festival is now organized seven times, and it is expected that more than tens of thousands will be spent on Central Park's Great Pasis, where participants will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes' performance, but also pay attention to the real purpose of the event: the elimination of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival was first organised as part of the Global Poverty Project in 2012. The project is run by an international interest team, which aims to eliminate poverty by bringing more and more people into an active fight against poverty.
The concert can be free of charge for those (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or actions, such as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, a telephone call, or any other relevant activity that may draw attention to the project's objective: poverty eradication.
But how successful has the global citizen in the last 12 years been to achieve the goals set?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts in order to convince others of the importance of action, or is this just another form of called ‘clinkivism’ when people feel worthy of contributing to a case by signing or writing an online petition on Twitter?
Since 2011, more than 19 million ‘citizens’ have been involved in the project, which has served a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to making the world’s leaders 37 billion dollars separate from poverty policies and commitments that can affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements were derived from their actions, of which $10 billion have already been paid out or collected during the collection of donations.
The group estimates that the money collected was directly involved in the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, with a view to helping children achieve the potential of living in them, to promote the eradication of Rwanda promised $35 million after having received more than 4700 Twitter messages from \"global citizens\".
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can condemn social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes of history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also claims that, after more than 5,000 actions, the United Kingdom has been requested to improve the food supply of mothers and children, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food supply of 5 million women and children.
One of the many questions published on the Global Civil Society website is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated? ”
According to a global citizen’s response, “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fail and sometimes fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we also achieve our goal because we are stronger together.
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will take part in this New York event, and the programme managers will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Interior: U.S. Navy-Bloods, would apply to prevent Russian energy exports
“If necessary, Washington would even introduce the Navy against the market for Russian energy carriers, such as the Middle East, Russia’s energy, quoted Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, Washington Examner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's active presence in Syria, particularly as regards Russian operations with the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is only an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” said Zinke.
And according to the Minister of Interior, there are methods to prevent the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure that marine routes are open and that they can be brought under its block if necessary, so it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, the nonprofit group, however, defines itself as ‘energy consumers’ in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way as the use of existing energy carriers and the introduction of new ones,” said Zinke, while calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy, ” pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export fluorescent natural gas to Europe, thereby reducing Russia from the market that offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump government, including the President themselves, will convince Germany to back down the \"no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-one\" project, which, if carried out, will make Germany a Moscow hostage.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the existing capacity is doubled, with a capacity increase of 110 billion cubic metres, the North Stream 2 pipelines of USD 11 billion are exclusively an economic project.
According to the Kreml, Washington is opposed to such a project for economic reasons, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercises and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely,” said Alexander Novak Russian Minister of Energy after a September meeting with the American Minister for Energy, Rick Perry.
The US's efforts to convince people went backwards, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI) called on the USA not to intervene in the EU's energy policy, as it should be kept away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Angela Merkel and Vlagyir Putin, President of the German Industry Association (BDI) after his last meeting.

18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new American asylum policy, which means that they cannot get asylum from those who run from gangs or from domestic violence.
Expert letter from 18 different Member States and from Washington D.C. has been written on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker in court, reports NBC News.
In August, the full name of Grace vs. Sessions’ defendant, initiated against federal policy, was not made public.
According to the applicant, he was assaulted by his partner and “sons of violent crime, ” but American officials refused asylum on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The prosecutors of the States supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum requests to the United States come from, because in these countries there is a constant problem of violence by criminal gangs and within the family.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn a decision taken by the Committee on the appeal of immigrants in 2014 (Board of Immgrant Appeals, BIA), which allows non-documented immigrants to apply for asylum when they are fleeing from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s attorney in a Friday's communication said that the new policy \"outsides tens of decades of state, federal and international law\"
“All asylum applications under federal law must be assessed in accordance with the facts and circumstances in the case, and such an obstacle infringes this principle,” says the expert letter.
In addition, the prosecutors explained in the letter that the anti-immigrant policy would harm the US economy, as immigrants would become more likely to become entrepreneurs, and that “the lowest level of jobs will be added to it. ”
In June, General Jeff Sessions instructed the asylum judges not to give asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“The right to asylum leaves your country because of racial, religious, national origin, belonging to a specific social group or a legitimate fear of political conviction or persecution,” said Sessions on 11 June when the policy was announced.
The right to asylum has not been found to solve all the problems that people face today in the world – they are of any serious nature.

I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of facing the country with propaganda advertisements
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. It was a week after a official Chinese newspaper reported a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that highlighted the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
On Wednesday, last year, President Donald Trump referred to his announcement in China Daily Des Moines Register, the largest copy of Iowa's newspaper, while accused China of trying to intervene in the American Congress elections of 6 November.
Trump's accusation is that Beijing is trying to intervene in American elections, according to some U.S. officials reporting to Reuters, is a new stage in a growing effort against Washington China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is an increasingly intensive trade war between Beijing and Washington, which imposes new and new duties on each other's import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the commercial war, the Chinese customs duties sought to target exporters from the countries in which Trump and the Republican Party were popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador of the United States and former governor of Iowa for several cycles said that Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses, because Iowa is exporting a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his Sunday opinion in Des Moines Register that “Kina continues to ruble our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press. ”
“The Chinese government exploits the great American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a peking press, we hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not reflect the different views of Chinese people, which differ from one another, about the growing prospects for growth in the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad added: “One of the most famous newspapers in China refused to bring down his article, but he did not name the paper.
According to the speakers, the Republicans can move women's voters to the Kavanaugh scandal before the mid-term elections.
It seems to me that many high-level Republican politicians will be able to defend Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate for sexual harassment charges, in particular, losing support for women's voters before half-time elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be withdrawn – says Grant Reeher, a politician at Maxwell School at the University of Szirrakúz, reports the Saturday article of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the FBI investigation by the Senator Jeff Flake Republican, Arizona, at the last minute, will be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Prime Minister and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, Washington, D.C., on Friday.
According to Mickey's report, on Friday morning, some of the protestors in the Senate's corridor scandaled that, “It is the November, ” because, despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford's testimony, the Committee on Legal Affairs, under the Republic, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's appointment.
\"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be amazingly popular,\" said Stu Rotheenberg, an independent political analyst.
“ Many people say that it has already been very high, and that is true.
But it may even be even higher, especially among cityless female voters and young people (18-29 years of age) who, although not enthusiastic for the president, often do not go to vote.
The analysts have already assumed that they could go back to the Republicans if they continue to stand by the mark of Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in detail in his statement why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrongly wrongly on the ground, ” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Commission at the beginning of the last week.
“It is not only about the Commission vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and, as Mr Ford has behaved, the President of the United States of America, Mr Guy Cecil, who has helped the election of the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite divided in whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
Based on the new survey of YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony in full or rather, and 35% of respondents at Kavanaugh gave the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh was likely to lie in his statement, while only 30% of respondents believed in Ford.
The Flake's motion is currently being examined by the FBI for the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with Kavanaugh's other defendant, Deborah Ramirez's claims, says the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford swore to the Senate Justice Committee that he was a drunk in Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his sexual organs at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the world network would launch a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the first inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform for Berners-Lee, Solidra.
Solid and your users can choose where to store your data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that the intention behind Inrupt was to “prove the power over the world, ”
“Now we have to do it,” he said about the startup.
- It's a historic moment.
With Solid technology, the application allows people to create their own “personal online database” and a POD.
This may include lists, works lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available at the same time.
In the personal online database, it is unique that the user can decide fully who has access to his data.
The company states that “the exercise of the right to self-determination of individuals”
According to John Bruce, Director General Inrupt, the company's task is to ensure resources, processes and adequate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the contract developers involved in the project and a community of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers in the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask \"Facebook and Google to introduce the complete change technology, which, from one day to the other, would place the business models of companies on top of the other, as a whole.
“We do not ask permission from them, ”
In the Medium on Saturday’s post Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s transmission of commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solidra-based network
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusets University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has participated as an important point of opinion in the discussions on internet neutrality in recent months.
Despite the launch of the Inrup, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am an extremely optimistic person for the next era of the world network, ” added Berners-Lee.
The disciple Bernard Vann Viktória was celebrated in World War I
The only Victoria Cross is celebrated by Anglican clergyman, his hometown, 100 years after he performed his heroin in World War I.
Bernard Vann was respected and underprivileged during the attack on Bellengise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed, so he never knew he deserved the highest honor of British armed forces.
His two grandkids of the Memorial were shot at the Saturday celebration at the Northamptonshire county in Rushden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “sympathetic, ” that the memorial was transferred exactly after the act of his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gatzet, Bernard Vann was respected and was led by the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel on 29 September 1918 by a narrow fog and a thin bed and machine-sucking platform in the middle of the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel.
Later, he was rushing into the faceline, and “with exceptional heroism, ” he stood at the head of the flag, and then all of it was taken by a camper’s bed, and three of his members were disharmed.
Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
“ I know I can never reach what my grandfather performed, and it taught me humility, ” said 72 - year - old Michael Vann.
After the launch by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also been shattered by the monument.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was an honor to play a part at the ceremony, and he added: “The vision of a true hero is demonstrated by how many people are later expressing their respect.
The MMA raiders have been up all night looking at the Bellator 206 transmission instead of the Peppa malaco.
Imagine that all night long she was up all night so she could watch the exciting Bellator 206, and this transmission is missing.
In San José's show, 13 battles were played, six of which were broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 live as part of the main competition show.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were just about to fight each other, England's viewers didn't have a small surprise for the game instead of Peppa Malac.
A lot of people were making it difficult for them to stay up until dawn because of this conflict.
Instead of the MMA match, one of the fans “a kind of sick joke, ” titled a child cartoon on Twitter.
“In accordance with state law, such content should no longer be transmitted at 6 a.m. in the morning, and therefore they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Head of the Office for Communication and Marketing, Bellator.
- Yeah, it's Peppa, the time of the pig...
Scott Coker, President of Bellator's company, promised that in the future, the schedule of the programme would be revised to include viewers in the United Kingdom.
“I think we can solve this by repeating it,” Coker said.
– However, since it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, which is already Monday, we can't cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show was turned on, there were a lot of messages, and the majority of them were not exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that wasn't what we were talking about, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of the six, there will be only five matches in the program – we really wanted to make the viewers happy, but we're counting on ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual orientation with minority complex
Tom Daley's artificial Olympics said that in his young age, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but this led him to the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him. ”
In his Radio 4 Desert Island Discs radio show, Lauren Laverne told the director that he was up for gay rights to give others a “responsibility. ”
He added that since he was a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
Long-term programme manager Kirsty Young, has been out for months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, “as a shipwrecker, ” said Daley, as a young person, felt “less than anyone else, ” because“ she had not been accepted for being loved by boys and girls, ”
He said: “To this day, the feelings of lower order and secondness are the things that I hold back and the strength to reach my success.
He wanted to prove that he too is worth “in order not to disappoint everyone when it turns out to be sexual. ”
The two-legged Olympic Archbishop became a public representative of the LGBT community and requested the world's governments to degrade homosexuality by taking advantage of its role in the national community in Australia this year.
He said that he was talking about the matter because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and that he wanted to give others a “restraint. ”
The three-time world champion said that “the situation was entirely surprised, ” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, the American filmmaker, who first met him in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning scriptwriter were married last year, and according to his claim that age difference never reported a problem among them.
“ If you go through so many things when you were young, ” she said, “and your father died three years later in cancer, ” and you find someone like him who had experienced extreme experiences in your age class.
The couple in June adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“If you put this question to me last year, I would have said that the most important thing was to win my gold coin, ” she said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold force.
My Olympic gold coin is Robbie.
The child's name was Robert after Daley's father died at 40 years of age in 2011.
According to Daley's statement, his father didn't want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I had no choice answering to him that “papa, you will no longer be there in the first row,” quoted.
“ I stopped breathing, but until that moment, I could not accept that my father was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and acquired my booking.
“I was thrilled that this is what I have dreamt of all my life: jumping in front of an audience at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling than that,” she announced.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Büske) helped him to prepare for the Olympics, and until today he will be slippery when he hears.
Desert Island Discs starts on Sunday, local time at 11:15 on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson can record a record by participating in the 47th cup of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he doesn't want to keep it as an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays a record for 12 times a year on the two-year-old event, but he sent the team captain Jim Furyk to the bench because of the performance of the four-ball and four-game games on Saturday.
Instead of having five winners in the big competitions at the centre of events, as many times as the United States had to fight for victory, it is now in one half of the day that spends its team on the track with training, and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken its game.
The 48-year-old player was never at the top of his career, so Le Golf National is not really a narrow track, where the high grass has to pay a very high price for the flawed hits.
And if the track itself wasn't quite scary enough, Mickelson is facing the exactly playing Francesco Molinari English champions on Sunday, who won all four games this week in the start-up Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans starting with a four-point background before 12 individual matches begin hard, Mickelson's game can be of crucial importance.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“ You are fully aware of the role you played in today’s development. You beat my back, you scratched me, and you promised to be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- She's extremely confident.
He's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I didn't mean him two fights basically.
I've planned more, but in this situation, we've decided that's the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else.
With Mickelson's Sunday role, he's gonna make a deal about Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played any more games on Ryder's cup.
This will allow you to close a series of Ryder Cups that are far from the performance of the player individually.
Mickelson's 18 winners, 20 defeats and seven tie-ups, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of a veteran player has no tangible benefits for the team.
“Very, sarcastic, spiritous, he likes to joke with others, a great team member,” he explained.
– I think younger players also enjoyed playing games against him, and it's good to see it.
His presence is beyond the strict sense of the game.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, who holds individual matches, he can easily turn his back on luck.
The Danish player was first introduced in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the Seve Ballesteros team gained a five-point advantage against the Americans and, at the end of the game, they managed to keep a hairlined advantage for victory with a ratio of 141-2 to 31-2.
“We must always remind ourselves that, in spite of our great advantage in Valderrama, we have won only one hairline, and we have also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn, in the picture, after the 2018 class 5-3 Friday and yesterday victory, which will lead to 10-6 on Le Golf National.
– We are thinking about competitions in previous years, and already everyone sees that the game is not over.
You'll have to play full power tomorrow.
So come on and do all you need to win.
We can't relax until the points get on the board.
We've got our goal, which is nothing but winning this trophy, and now we're just focusing on it.
As I said before, I deal with 12 players of our team most, but we also need to listen to the other side, who are, by all means, one of the biggest players in the world.
The team’s performance on the hard track was proud of Bjørn said: “I would like to welcome you in such a situation.
The day tomorrow is a whole different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from the team game.
It's a great feeling to play with a couple when things go well, but when you're on your own, it all turns out, in every way, what golfer really is.
That's what you have to understand with the players to get the best out of the field tomorrow.
They need to break up with their partner, who will also have to make the best of their ways.
Unlike Bjørn and Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team expressly trusts that his players will do more individually than in a couple, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have obtained three points from the four.
Furyk personally has already experienced both sides of the last-day resurrection: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then the loser was on the side of the European team as a “Medinah miracle” after his mentioned bravour performance.
“I remember all the damn words, ” he replied when he was asked, “as he encouraged the players before the last day by the team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we are doing the best we can in Brookline, as we have seen in Medinah.
If one of the teams is really falling into this, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle games.
Accordingly, we set the order, and we prepared our players to do real wonders tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of standing at the top of the job-returns, and Rory McIlroy is playing against the first game, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are following the first half of the European team.
“I also decided on the order, because I believe that this is how the picture has been assembled from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added to the individual attitude.
Once again, the transfer of the new German warship has been postponed
The latest fleet of German Navy should have been in service in 2014 to replace the emerging Cold War vessels, but because of various system failures and the rising cost of the exponentially increasing waiting period.
The flagship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg class was postponed to the first half of 2019 by the opening-up of the Rheiinland-Pfalz, who wrote the diet Zeit weekly as one of the military spokespersons.
According to the initial plans, the ship should have joined the military bond in 2014, but the ongoing delays made it very difficult to make the fate of the major project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg ships to replace the Brémia-class fregates.
We understand that it will be equipped with high-fired cannons and various anti-air and water-water missiles and cover-up technologies, including a sign-reflecting device that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signs of the ship.
Another important feature is that you need maintenance in a tighter way, which in practice means that these latest frenzys can be placed away from the mother-in-laws for up to two years.
However, because of the continuing slide of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they were finally in service, noted Die Zeit.
The heavy fate F125 was placed on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to open the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss factory in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship delivered to the manufacturer.
The reasons for the return were not much information that came to light, but the German media has a number of critical \"soft and hardware errors\", which make the warship unusable on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors on Baden-Württemberg class ships will be served, which is half the crew of the old Brémia class fregates.
It is also clear that the ship is extremely overweighted, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further amendments.
The 7,000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are supposed to be twice as difficult as those of German ships of a similar class set up by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from flawed components, the increase in the overall cost of the project, apart from training the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project's cost has already reached the estimated EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) amount, while the initial draft was estimated at EUR 2.2 billion.
In light of the particular importance of the new fleet problems, it is warned that Germany's presence in the sea is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, has recently acknowledged that the Navy has started to lose out of the vulnerable warships.
According to the civil servant, the problem has sometimes become a self-destructive process, as old ships have to be removed, but there are no more ships to replace the fallouts.
He expressed concern about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg classes could join the Navy bond.
National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a scotch-floor property designed to find out how bats use the landscape during hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which may also benefit from future protection initiatives.
Scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behaviour of common and soprano dwarfs, and of brown long-term bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
In the appropriate points of the area, special means are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will make mobile data collection with manual detectors.
In a detailed analysis of the sound of the recordings, the frequency of deneumatic sounds can be determined, or what species is doing.
The researchers are also preparing a habitat map and report to determine in detail how the behaviour of the animals depends on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation advisor hopes that the results will reveal what are the most important habitats for bats and how they are used.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of living work, such as the development of insects, and how forest areas can best be preserved for bats and other relevant species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has fallen significantly over the last century.
Buildings and territorial development work interfere with the animal’s sleeping areas and reduce their living space.
The wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with settled leopards, certain chemical procedures used for construction materials, as well as the attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really completely blind.
However, because of us at night, the predators are more dependent on their hearing when they are hunting for the bride and not on their vision.
Their sophisticated technique based on the reverse of the ultrasound can determine the exact position of insects and of the spaces in their path.
The NTS, which has over 270 historical buildings, is responsible for maintaining 38 gardens and 76 000 acres of land, takes the question of bats very seriously.
Ten skilled professionals are working on a regular basis to conduct studies and bedside studies and sometimes participate in rescue work.
The organization has created the first and only dedicated bats of Scotland on the Threve-birds located in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, which provides eight of the ten denetary species of Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here inThreave they have a great place for bats,” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else needed for a good living space.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel fine.
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that there are bats living there before the renovation of buildings, since the destruction of a single establishment could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the death of the entire local population.
The bats of protected animals, their destruction, their harassment and their habitats are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Swiss representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also requested help from the population.
He said: “There are still many things we do not know about bats, and we do not have much information about the situation of most domestic species.
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, lawyers are suing against German magazine
Cristiano Rondodo’s news, “I have found charges of rape against him, ” says others who are trying to use his name to ‘ get public knowledge. ’
The football attorneys are ready to sue a German weekly named Der Spiegel who brought the charges.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Battle of Juventus was accused of rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375 000 to listen to the case, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo reported a few hours after the prosecutions were released in an Instagram Live video with a fan camp of 142 million, that the news was “a lie. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they've been putting together about me today is all a lie,\" said the camera the five-fold goldball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
That's what happens.
They want to be famous for my name, this is the life of the public.
I am a happy man, and I have a good life, ” added the player with a smile.
Because of the claims that are “inadmissible, infringing privacy, ” Ronnie's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz's statement, the player will submit a claim for damages, to an extent appropriate for the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.
The case was reported to have taken place in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the sports suite where the man had an anal assault on the woman, standing in the papers submitted to the district attorney of Clark County in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo was on his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent good, ” except for“ one percent alone. ”
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronald admitted that he had a sexual relationship with the woman, but he believed that all this had been done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police, and a hospital had prepared a visit on his injuries, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because “he was afraid of the distortion, and also of“ public humiliation. ”
The 34-year-old woman would now like to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to weaken her life.
At the time of the alleged attack, Mr Rondo was just before the verification (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) and this summer, the giant Italian player was bought for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will treat it forever – the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will treat you forever, if you lose your world leader's manufacturing position after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added: “It is worrying, ” said the UK, ‘that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, it will be forced to temporarily stop production at the factory near Derby.
“There is a need for an agreement, ” said Clark.
According to the Japanese car manufacturing company, jobs may be lost in the case of an agreementless Brexit due to cross-border delays.
Toyota Auris and Avensis were manufactured last year by a company of 150 000 cars, which exported 90% of them to other EU Member States.
“I see that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, it will take place in the factory –” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota Burnostoni.
Other car manufacturers operating in the United Kingdom (including Honduras, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concern about the likelihood that the country would leave the EU without agreement on the operation of trade beyond borders.
For example, BMW stated that after Brexit, he would close Minik's production plant in Oxford for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that there are risks in the supply chain in the case of an agreementless Brex.
The Toyota production line operates on the basis of “in-time” parts come from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States for 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, cross-border disruptions may lead to production delays and partial shortages, according to industry's representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough spare parts for more than one day in Derbyshire's plant, which should stop production.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was set up to avoid delays at the border.
“We have a need for an agreement, and we want an agreement under the best possible conditions, which is not only a fruit of our current success, but also a new opportunity,” said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only is Toyota, but also other producers can confirm that we still need to keep our highly successful supply chain –
Toyota could not tell us how long production would take, but it warned us that the cost of the colludant could undermine the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which could ultimately lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked 24 years at the Burnastoni plant and is currently active in the representation of the Union trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that we will never be able to get back jobs that end at this time. ”
One government speaker said: “We have developed a comprehensive and feasible plan for future EU relations –
Once again, you can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting, said the White House.
“A week later, they may postpone the meeting of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate about the supreme court candidate is still ongoing, published on Sunday in the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence on elections, possibly the relations between Trump's advisors and the Russian government, as well as the possible obstruction of the justice service Trump.
In Washington, for months, they have found that Trump is finally losing his deputy attorney, thereby endangering Mueller's independence.
According to the New York Times, this month's announcement, Rosenstein considered that he would come to a meeting in order to confirm his conversation with the President, and the question also raised the possibility of replacing Trump on the basis of the 25th constitutional amendment.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
Last seven Monday, however, he visited the White House and spoke to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trumpp, whose presence was in New York City on Thursday, was announced.
Trump said that “not welcome, ” he would go to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not meet the hearing of the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-on-year FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, which made the final Senate vote even worse.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: “We do not have a appointed date yet, or this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court I see a chance for another one-week delay.
I'll soon find out, and as always, I'll let the press know.
However, some journalists expressed doubts about this statement: Mr Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace also asked about this reason.
Sanders replied that the reason for the rareness of the press reporters was not the cause for the behavior of the television reporters, the “saint of sensational behavior, ” but added: “I do not debate the fact that they are indeed sensational practitioners, ”
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the media would take place more often.
“The president asks you more questions than any former president,” he said. He added, even without supporting the claim, “We have looked at the numbers.
Press releases will continue, said Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to put its questions directly to the President of the United States, the light years would be better than if they were talking to me.
We often try to find a series of things, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so you can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House Press Providers.
Trump will respond regularly to reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or public events, perhaps taking part in press conferences.
Press conferences alone, however, are quite rare.
Why, it may be concluded that what happened this week, when the president, in New York, had a major role to play in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the healthcare wallet sent a letter to NHS Scotland’s EU staff about concerns about Brexit
The head of the health wallet expressed the country's gratitude by letter to the workers from the countries of the European Union, and highlighted that they hope to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of the application for residence of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote: “The negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer, as a result of which a decision is expected to be taken in the fall.
The UK Government has also agreed to prepare a scenario without any agreement.
I am aware of the worrying period that this may be for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.
Workers from different EU Member States and from other countries will help with valuable experience and expertise in the work of the health wallet, which will also have a positive impact on patients and our communities.
Scotland is also your home, and we would very much like them to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie was in an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
The Tenssee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, was in an emergency operation after he had a head injury in a fight against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27, reported by Mike Organ Tenssee.
The head of the Tenssee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury was shortly before halftime.
“ He walked out to the coast, and he just fell apart, ” said Reed.
The members of the training team and health personnel first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track and then put it on a barrel and took it for further examinations.
One of the authorities of Tenssee State in Nashville, Tenssee, said Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no further details about the type and extent of injury can be found at the same time, ” while the Tennesse State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-long second-year student, spends his first season on the Tenssee State team to which he was certified as Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful equipment before leaving the track, so he's already at 18.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the United Kingdom
On the basis of the new plan of Toryk, foreign customers will have to pay higher taxes after the properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and the additional purchase will support the homeless.
By this step, I would neutralize the success of Corbyn among young voters
The increase in taxes is aimed at those who do not tax in the United Kingdom
According to the State Treasury's calculations, this would represent 120 million pounds per year, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and this extra income will be used to support homeless people and will be announced at Theresa May today's press conference.
The aim of this step is probably to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which has achieved a more affordable promise of housing and measures aimed at high incomes.
The increase of the levy will concern individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom and will use this extra revenue to combat homeless people.
The additional premium to be paid to the current tax, which may exceed three per cent of the higher tax on the second apartments two years ago or the property purchased for the purposes of the issue.
The State Registry is calculated on the basis of the measure as revenue of EUR 120 million per year.
According to estimates, 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by nationals outside the United Kingdom, resulting in a significant price increase, which makes it increasingly difficult to see the situation of the first housing buyers.
Many of the rich districts of the country became “steel cities ” especially in the capital, as many foreign customers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees to help young people who were waiting for their first home.
According to his person, large construction companies are held responsible for keeping the real estate prices high, whose custom has become the purchase of areas and the abandonment of parlagon.
Corbyn has also presented remarkable proposals on the number of housing reforms, including housing control and the elimination of well-founded housing.
In addition, it would provide advice for building new houses.
May said: “I said that I would like to devote my Prime Minister to restoring the English dream and that life is getting better for every generation.
This requires a real estate market situation.
Britain continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live here, to work and to set up a family.
However, it is not right that individuals outside the country, as well as companies of foreign interest, can easily buy properties as hard-working English citizens.
Dreams from their own home became almost untapped for too many, and the insatiable condition of homelessness became too accessible.
Jack Ross: “I want to be the manager of the Scottish team, ”
Jack Ross, according to the Sunderland coach's statement, \"a major desire,\" is to be the manager of the Scottish national team once.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take up the challenges of the North-East club, which is currently in the third place of the first-class league, with only three points remaining from the first position.
He then moved his seat to a stadium baptized to the Stadium of Light after he successfully returned his team of St. Mirren to the first-class Scottish football competition.
“I wanted to play as a friend for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get in among the spare people – said Ross on the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“ When I was a child, I watched a lot of Scottish team games in Hamburg with my father, and something always pulled me back to them.
Now, however, I only have the chance to succeed as a club manager –
There's Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio on the front of the Sunderland manager.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not concerned about the need for such great names to be printed and has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“The success is being assessed at this moment as to whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it will undoubtedly be the place in the first-class league, he said.
– It will not be easy to get back, but more than likely, I will only be able to see my activities here as a success if you succeed in getting the club back –
Ross' management career started just three years ago, after working as an assistant coach at Dumbarton's team for a while, and spent 15 months at the Hearts Coach' Guard.
Then Aolla helped to get on the back floor after the team fell back to third grade, and St. Mirren and St. Mirren, who was on the edge of the fall, got the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross claims that he's feeling much more confident now than he's ever seen in his career as the Clyde, either the Hartlepool, the Falkir, St. Mirren or the Hamilton Academic team.
“It was a very decisive moment, ” quoted the period spent as a Coach of Alloa.
– I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done a good job of my life, and I've had a few truly remembered moments.
However, the lives of players are sometimes very hard.
A lot of things have to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the job, but I have management tasks.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've tasted it all my life, I feel the best thing about my skin.
The full interview will be broadcast from 12:00 to 13:00 on the Radio Scotland channel, on Sunday's 30 September, at local time.
According to a study, the beer's best at 5:30 p.m.
During the summer heat wave, the circulation of the inglican pubs in difficulty increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under very much pressure.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of the CGA, bringing together the statistics, said: “The trend of the previous month continued in July, when the pubs experienced a 2.8% increase, the difference between the fact that the decline in restaurants was even greater than it was expected to be observed.
The decline in the revenue of restaurants in June has worsened further in July.
Bars and pubs, which mainly sell alcohol, have been the best performers who have produced more growth than those found in restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also unpleasantly affected by long-term sunshine, although not nearly as dramatic as the restaurants’ operators.
It seems people prefer to drink at this time.
The income of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the income from food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a free-time and catering RSM analyst said: “These results follow the trend that has been drawing since the end of April.
The weather and major Community and sporting events remain the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and the annual income loss of 4.8% may become particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
There could not have been a worse time for long, hot summer for restaurants to operate, and it will only be time to see whether the reduced weather experienced in August also brings some relief in this area.
The total revenue increase in pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, with the exception of newly opened places, reflecting the slow pace of introducing new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK catering sector (Pubs, bars and restaurants) and represents a widely accepted industrial focus, collects and analyses the performance data of an operator group of over $9 billion, consisting of 47 members.
Of five, a child has social media fiction that is kept away from his parents.
According to a survey, one out of five has (even at 11 years of age) social media sons that are kept away from their parents and teachers.

One out of five creates a child (even at 11 years of age) a social media account that is kept away from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of Insta students is very much higher, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students replied that they have an unmagulated “head ” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally found her on the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, found her teenage profile, on which she said: “Restrict yourselves, ”
According to the research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the directors and directors of independent schools, Headmasters’ and Heads’ Conference (HMC), 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% acknowledged that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them, ” said HMC leader, Mike Buchanan.
Eilith Doyle will be the voice of the “porters – the Scottish Alliance of Atlétics
Eilith Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Atlétics Association at the annual meeting of the Management Board.
The most successful presence of Doyle Scotland, and the President of the Board, Ian Beattie, says that the decision-makers in sport will be invaluable aid for the extensive international experience gained over the past decade.

He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.

Thank you for all the encouraging messages.
A breast cancer similar to cows divides the online community
Heves made an online debate about a company producing breast-sucks, which compared mammals to head-sleeks.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first silent, portable breast-suit ” and the appearance of their products in a musical video of himself, an ironic commercial, showing what freedom the device gave to the mothers who had their milk.
The four real mothers dance in a cow stand full of apples, while the song that draws the following lines in the background can be heard: “Yes, I have my head, I don’t even have my tail, and “if I haven’t noticed, these are not breasts, but my breasts, ”
And the rephrenic reads: “I am pumping, that the child eats big ones, pumps, pumps, heads the girls, ”
The advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has soon become a cross-fertilizer for online disputes.
The video received 77 000 views and received hundreds of combined reception comments. Many believe that the advertising gút is from the dairy industry’s “borsals”
“The product is widely advertised with unflavoured cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth to their offspring, but their wines are taken away from them within days, ” reminds one of them.
Elvie breast-feeding can be placed on a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
According to another comment, “Yes, it is terrible for the mother and the young.
But why not use them to give breast-sucks to mothers who can keep their children?
Someone else added: “A total insensitivity ad“
Others came to protect advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “seriously funny, ”
\"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would've bought it one by one if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it again.
The product is brilliant – – it is written.
According to another commenter, “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who feel like “the cow” at their workplace or in a toilet.
It is not the milk industry that boasts or condemns:
At the end of the video, women show that during the dance they had the discreet bra in their bra.
The campaign is building up the feeling that women who use breast-suck sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, is silent, does not use wires and pipes, can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move freely, hold their children or even move during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and communication director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing to the parallel between women with milk, we were trying to draw attention to the challenges of breast-feeding and to find it funny to see what the sense of freedom our breast-sucker gives in comparison with this,
Elvie's breast-suck didn't come into the news for the first time.
On the London Fashion Week, a two - child mother, Marta Jakubowski, entered the runway while using the product.
Hundreds of juvenile migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of child-age migrants in custody, while the number of border crossings in the month did not change much. This is partly explained by the fact that the gross rhetoric of Trump administration and its measures have made it harder for them to find host homes.
Intruders typically are illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they will ruin their chances of staying in the country if children are admitted.
This threat continued to increase in June when it was announced that parents and adults living with them in the household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Bureau of Immmigrants and Customs Enforcement (Emigration and Customs Office) acknowledged in his statement before Congress that several dozen were arrested for the reception of minors who arrived without escort.
The Office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were impunity.
“80% of immigrants and those living in a household are illegally staying in the country and a large part of them are convicted of criminal activity.
Therefore, we continue to search for such individuals,” said Albence.
In order to speed up the process for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of being arrested, instead of 60 days before the court, the social workers are ordered.
Many people report to the court through videoconference calls, instead of personal appearances, to apply for residence permits.
If the judge doesn't provide legal protection, the immigrant will be taken out quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer the detention, the more nervous and depressive the children, and the increased chance of violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
According to law enforcement, these risks are only increased by a larger facility such as their towers, where it is difficult to locate those who need psychological care due to the number of children.
They added that if they did not provide enough time for children to prepare or say goodbye to friends before moving them to such an establishment, they would make them even more trauma.
Syria has called for immediate exit to the American, French and Turkish-traffic forces:
Before the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem requested Syrian refugees to return to their country for eight years.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Moualem, also claimed that foreign forces were illegally entering the Syrian area for the fight against terrorism, and that they would be treated as “as such. ”
“They have to withdraw without such a condition, ” said the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that “the war against terrorism will soon end in Syria, where more than 360 000 have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He announced that Damascus will continue his sacred struggle to clean the entire territory of Syria from terrorist groups and from “an illegal foreign presence”
The United States of America's 2000 soldiers are in Syria, the majority of them are trained and as advisors to assist the Kurd forces and the Persian Arab militias.
France has sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country of war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that conditions are appropriate for their return, and only “one Western countries ” have the advantage of “irradial fears, ” causing the refugees to flee from their return.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help return to the population,” announced.
– A policy has been made out of a purely humanitarian issue:
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement was reached between the Lord and his opposition on the closure of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a conflict zone in the last great cloud of the ascenders, around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-gypsy deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from attacking a wide range of three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement was defined by ‘light deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed only against jihadists, including An-Nustra Front linked to Al-Kaiida, which had to be ‘researched’.
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that there will soon be a meeting of a committee composed of representatives of the government and opposition, whose task is to draw up the post-war constitution and prepare elections.
Moualem considers that the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, such as the revision of some articles of the current Constitution, is acceptable and protects all external actors from the ongoing intervention.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trumpot.
Following this logic, Trumpot will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless there are many liberal viewers' hopes, and it will not bring an end to its Presidency before a period of responsibility or a scandal.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic president’s bill of all time, ”
But for now, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, close to doubles, CNN's main-time view increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC tripled its view, to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main programme instead of 1,7 million people four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show – is the most viewed cable show with its 3.5 million audience, which comes in the evenings of the major news.
“It attracts us like a fire, because it is something we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of the ABC-The appointed survivor. In this series, the office is sitting in the chair of the president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
The author of Nell Scovell's veteran, “Just the Funny Parts: And the Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, stands differently.
As a result, a taxi from Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why, ” asked Scovell.
“Because he named me, ” said the driver.
This is the entertainment of chaos.
In contrast to television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases similar to Roe vs. Wade-precedents so that they can reunite immigrant families and the stability of the global economy.
It's just a very narrow layer to make sure you don't mind these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsibility for information when we have been staring at a series of arguments in which the authenticity of the anonymous background talks used in Bob Woodward's book, or Paul Manafort's 15 thousand dollar strike jacket jackets, according to the wording of the Washington Post, is concerned, or the consequences of the description of Stormy Daniels Trump, anatomy, anatomy.
What was right for me, I'll always think of Super Mario.
“A little feeling like you are looking at a reality show where you get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the author of the “Crazy Stares. In Trump’s show, the participants are constantly changing and new turns are coming daily (for N.F.L., to praise Kim Dzongunt).
If you miss one part, you'll be gone right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant 26-degree, sunny time in Kaiain, he still choked on the MSNBC in his house while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't break off from TV, as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing started in the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court was.
“I remember, when we made those crazy shows, many said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, he quoted Fleiss.
“ I thought they were kidding, but they seem to have been right, ”

Both parties are pouring money into the toughest competitions in the half-time congress election
No one was surprised that in the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, both parties were going to spend their money uncalculated after the two active representatives were redesigned for the same chair.
One of the competitions for the recently re-designed suburban district of Pittsburgh is the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won a mandate last spring at an interim election.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of the former presidential district of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17 district.
The map had to be redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania found in January that the previous district limits were manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties were financed by the Democrat Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC) were almost intertwined during the campaign.
Lamb's name was then known in Pennsylvania that he won a close competition at the inter-ministerial election in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade, his seat was for the Republicans, and Donald Trump won the district with 20 exact advantages.
According to the political experts, the Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The United States's sanctions against El Salvador were considered in support of China, and then it stopped the plan.
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on Beijing's side, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump was in a good mood in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called back U.S. colleagues from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their recent decision that they did not support Taiwan, reported earlier by Heather Nauert, the minister of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about 140 million US aid in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed meetings continued, North and Central America’s competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year and was the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In the middle of September, high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not wish to punish El Salvador.
It has been announced that at the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence, who says that the diplomats have a clear indication of the importance of the event.
Three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue criminal statements and did not take criminal measures.
John Bolton's white spokesperson refused to declare the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by three American officials, including two diplomats.
These reports were also supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next strike may be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who will examine whether Trump has somehow prevented justice.....to a large number of public facts indicate that.
Mueller's investigation also allegedly covers whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats get into most of the Congress, they will certainly try to take responsibility for Trumpot, who, after the voters, may also have to face the conviction of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as it is for its European partners.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how long the fight will go.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to push Hitler. They were just waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechs in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
It is at historical points like this that the inevitable development of democracy is speeding up or slowed down.
Today, we can identify several such turning points in America.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires the Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who's in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been smoking since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, it recommended to record talks with the president and to call on Trump to complete his unsolicited office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times reported the events in an inaccurate way.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation initiated against Brett Kavanaugh is caught or not complete, and despite a false charges of sexual harassment, is appointed as member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is: are we voting in the interim election for a congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trumpot?
If we fail at these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I trust it won't be like this, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovakians, a Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by my Nazi regime, the same regime that was once in my ambassador's home building.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on a table wearing the sign of the Slovaks at the time of Sabbath.
With this cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

The Graham Dorrans playing at the Rangers before the Rapid Vienna game.
The Rangers will be receiving Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and the Austrian victory against the Spanish Villarreal may guarantee them participation in the Group of the European League G.
Because of Graham Dorrans' knee injury, he couldn't go on the course until the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he feels that he can set himself the most ambitious goals built on this result.
“The point was a great team against Villarreal, ” said 31-year-old player.
– We believed we were able to get a point, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled another gol at the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
In the first half of the time, they were better, and we connected in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were good enough for the previous game, but we'll definitely have the power behind our backs to win.
Last year was hard enough, I got hit, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
It's a good team, boys enjoy the game, the training goes well.
I hope that if we give in, we can leave the previous season behind us and achieve good results.
A lot of women are worried about not saving enough time.
Students in the survey had accurate ideas about what kind of old-age care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about this with family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them responded to talking about this with their children.
“All of us want a member of the family to take care of them, but they do not always raise the subject,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Company.
The following should be done.
First discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take good care of you if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with his adviser and his family, choose where and what kind of care they want; these decisions have a significant impact on future costs.
Take in a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas about how to pay for the planned supply.
Financing may take place with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care or with a hybrid savings, which can cover expenditure or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: So they will cut out the possibility of later sues.
Trust a representative, a trusted person on your behalf in health matters, supervise medical care and ensure that everything happens according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with his finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and ensure that accounts are paid when you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the little details: Let's assume that your elderly parent has been in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medicines and your allergies?
Such data shall be recorded in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It is not only the financial questions that need to be clarified, neither does it matter who his doctor is, ” added Martin.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned in advance.

Earthquakes and fountains in Indonesia
They lost their lives on at least 384 when a large earthquake on Friday, and then a fountain hit the city of Palu in Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims could grow further.
The communication network of the region has also been damaged, so no news has yet been received from the government of Dongala north of Palu, where it was the headquarters of the 7.5 earthquakes.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on Celebesz Island:

Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York.
New York federal prosecutors are asking for a death sentence on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the eight terrorist attacks in New York City since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov, accused of driving a truck rented from Home Depot in October on a bicycle road on the streets of Alsó-Manhattan West Side Highway, run several pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov was guilty of killing eight victims, and “he was guilty of injury, ” standing in the case of a lawyer in the southern district of New York.
According to the document submitted, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-order blackmail murders, which were used almost exclusively for organised crime and for the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for significant planning and premeditated intentions, the prosecutors claim, and Saipov put it into practice in a “serious, cruel, inhuman way. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alessandro Damian Pagnucco – in the submission.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The New York South District last decade asked for a death penalty for a defendant.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to a life sentence.
In the New York Federal case, the last death sentence was executed in 1953, in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in a electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the Court’s evidence, Saipov, born in Fübgegian, proved no harm in the days and months after the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was happy to complete the act.
Saipov said that the ISIS tapes on his phone gave him the idea of the attack were in the defendant's office.
According to the police, they asked me to put an ISIS out in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, he confessed to himself as innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovo, said that they were “indiscretionably disappointed, ” because of the decision of the prosecutors.
“It is our belief that the actual loss of life in prison for a confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty would only prolong the sufferings of all the parties involved,” says Patton.
Saipov's defenders have asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty for their protection.
According to a representative of Tory, NIGEL FAAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, at a demonstration held during the Tory Conference, declared that “the army of the people was called into battle, ”
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics after one of the parties in Theresa May called on Farage to be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, who has not served any office, told the participants in the Birmingham Assembly that the United Kingdom, which had already left, had Farage been Minister for Brexit.
It is well characterised by the pressure within the Parish that mayre, that the remains of Toryk have spoken in the city on another anti-Brexit demonstration.
May is trying to implement the provisions of the Chequers Plan, which requires constant licensing between the Brexit and the Permanent Party and the EU.
According to allies, despite the negative reactions, Brussels is trying to reach an agreement so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only be chosen from their package or “full chaos”.
Bone at the Solihull Leave Means Leave (the exit means we're leaving,) said in a demonstration that we had to calculate with the \"Chequers-alku,\"
He suggested that Farage be brought into the House of Lords and that negotiations with Brussels be entrusted to him.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have gone out, ” announced.
He added: “I will remain with Brex, but the Chequers initiative will have to be counted.
He criticised the EU: “We did not fight in World Wars to be servants of others.
We want to bring about the laws of our own country.
Bone rejected the assumption that the public voice had changed since the vote in 2016: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to remain, ”
Andrea Jenkyns, the representative of the Brexit Party Tory, also attended the meeting and said to journalists: “It is just what I ask: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers Initiative rejects the public opinion, the opposition will not vote, it will not be popular, and especially among the activists who are working on the field, and they helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers Initiative and listen to us.
He added to May as a sacrificial message: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his chair, who keeps his word, ”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “ensure the pressure, ” that they should not dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now the stake.
– They want to sell Brexite, and today we are gathered together to send a message, and we do not allow it to be done.
With these words, he turned to the enthusiastic crowd: “I would love to hear the pressure from our politicians who are preparing to betray Brex.
We call on the people's army to win with Brex, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom a new independent, independent, proud country.
During this time, the remaining couples took up Birmingham, and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Some activists took place this weekend, “Toryk against Brex, ” said the flag of the movement.
The Lord Adonis of the Labour Party was on the conservatives because of the security mistakes that took place at the opening of the conference.
“These people have said that they have the IT background for an agreement on Canada’s plus plus agreement, without a border crossing and an agreement on free trade with Ireland, without borders.
- They're just talking to me.
There is simply no good Brex, he stressed.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the World Championship after he won before Sebastian Vettel, thanks to the team orders.
Once Valtter Bottas qualified himself to a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the Mercedes team's instructions will play a major role in my race.
Bottas, who started out of position, started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble, because the first two around protected his position, which enabled him to attack his teammate.
At first Vettel stood up in the box and let Hamilton get stuck behind the middle field, which should have proved decisive.
Mercedes stood a circle later, and came out behind Vettel, but it came out after a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot was released, after moving twice as a defense in the third hemisphere.
Max Verstapsen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the track, and at the end of the first round, he was the seventh.
He then led most of the race, since he did not exchange rubbers so that he could get to the target quickly and avoid Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, he stood around the 44th round of the box, but he couldn't increase his pace in the remaining eight circles, so the fourth place was Räikköne.
“It was a day, because Valtter had a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team achieved exceptional work to get the first two seats – said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, as the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasay Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, a new member of the Supreme Court, of sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony, which was made before the Senate's Justice Committee, just noted, the things in the Senate prove that people are “creatives, haters and liars. ”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days, when they see anger when they see that people are angry, cramped, hated and lying, ” he said.
“If we look at statements and leaks, they say, ‘ Oh, well, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you leaking?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak.’
Well, let's stop for a second.
We leaked?...No, we didn't leak, he did it, michaeling the senator.
He sent a letter of detail to Feinstein on the charges against Kavanaugh in July and leaked the letter at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak would have been his office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims, and I did not leak his story, ” said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill report.
“He asked me to deal with it confidentially and, in accordance with his request, I also dealt with it confidentially,”
However, it seems that the President, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting, did not accept his denial: “I will tell you what the situation is: the body talk was very bad.
He may not leak, but this was the worst body talk I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, that the Democrats were using the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“ They decided to have any means, but they will regain power.
You can see the belief, the hatred, they don't care who's being hurt, who's to be run over to get power and control – quoted the words of the President at Mediaite.

According to Air Niugini's press release, a man cannot give an account of a passenger on Sunday afternoon.
According to the airline, they're working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to any further information on the passenger, such as questions concerning the age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and personnel after flying into the air while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials on Friday reported that seven people were delivered to the hospital.
According to the airline, there are six passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, we're all stable.
The cause of misfortune and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing path.
According to some witnesses, the plane took off the runway.
A U.S. passenger, Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed very low.
“This is a very good thing, ” commented Jayes.
Jaynes told me that with others, he was able to gas me in the water until the flying plane's emergency.
According to his statement, the air escorts panicd and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, in the vicinity of a rocket repairing sailors, they helped save them, and they delivered people to the coast with a blow-up boat, before the plane went down 30 metres of water.

He was familiar with the jury how he put together the mobile phone records, using the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
According to Rowlett, he received multiple phone data, based on which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford made a statement on Saturday that said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was “hearing because my truck was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis told me that she knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
Based on the cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that, after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls and contacts from her phone.

Another black one?
New York was suing a party after a “rassist ” message
A young man in New York started a case because of the dismissal of a couple of discriminations, after the mother complained that ‘ we were able to apply a black one again in a message sent to him.
The couple deny that they're racist and similar to the Persian blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when she saw that she was black when she arrived in 2016.
“SEWARE OF ME, I HAVE AWARE OF YOU,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message from her husband.
But instead of her husband, she sent her message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after a wake-up bactus, Plasco-Flaxman, who was “indistinctly abstinctly, ” had abandoned Ms. Maurice, claiming that the leaving dog, who was African-American, did a bad job, and it was more like a philippino.
Ms. Maurice was paid one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation, and she is asking for 350 dollars a daily compensation for the inward work for the six-month period for which she was originally hired, even though without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the journey, that cannot be done,” said the Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice’s application because they were afraid they could not trust him after he was violated.
\"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist, ” said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But would you trust your children with someone who, by chance, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on.
According to the comparative Plasco, his wife had only born the baby two months ago, and “he was in a very difficult situation. ”
“ Would anyone attack such a thing?
It is not a very nice thing to do, ” added the investment banker.
While the legal procedure is taking place, the public opinion court has already quickly condemned the party in the community media, harming their behaviour and logic.

He said that his father, who worked as an operator of the BBC, before being inspired to write a child book from a little toy machine, would not have made it any pain if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a success after his father's death last year.
She called it a very important member of their family, adding that her father was very proud of his final success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and he had no idea at all, ” he said.
“ But since Pgyston was almost real to him, he was like a child who would bring something to him: we are proud of him even if it wasn’t really ours.
I think that's how you saw the success of Paddton.
Although he created it, and he escaped from his imagination, he always attributed himself to the merit of Paddton,
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.

I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.

Cards for grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from throwing away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting out postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a walkes bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and then committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel the same thing I feel every day, ” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and he was stuck with everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that his smile would throw up any place.
However, before he died, he gave up his work because he was “in a very bad state”“
Tyler was found by his 11-year-old brother, who ended his life by himself.
Ms. Davis said: “I was worried that this would produce some kind of dominant effect. ”
Ms. David made postcards with the aim of finding out that there are people who can be sought and spoken to them, even if it was just a friend.
Do not sit quietly – you need to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who's been friends of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was a partner for 15 years, not long after the man's mother died.

“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his attitude.
She was completely under her own Christmas day: when the children opened up their gifts, she did not look in their eyes, and they were like: “

Questioning about Brett Kavanaugh's future, as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if he succeeded in achieving what he requested, a limited time-limited investigation, perhaps with agreement, he said on Saturday, adding that the committee held the party’s decisionless decisionlessness on the matter.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican have been opposed to the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be known as timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their people into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, and he'd be lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and he'd also known his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports his report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the vice-president, Mike Pence to decide to enter Mr. Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court.
No. of North Korea dissidents under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has been reduced since Kim Dzongun took over seven years ago, and he declared a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Bjongok quoted the data of the South Association Department and said that the last year there were 1127 dissidents compared to 2011 when this number was 2706.
Park said that the closer border guard between North Korea and China and the higher punishments for human smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
Most of the North dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have gone through the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run towards China, which has the longest border for North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between Korea.
The dissidents as Chinese illegal immigrants and they do not accept them as refugees and often send them back violently.
Practically, the relationship between North and South still in war has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyjan, with a focus of their discussion on the ongoing nuclear disposal negotiations.
This was the historic meeting in June between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Dzongun in Singapore, where they agreed to further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Mr Ri Jongho, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, accused American sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible to unilaterally disarm our weapons, ” said Ri in his speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh as a state-of-the-art, said he was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
The President of the Parliament, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, appointed the Supreme Court as “historic” and claimed that his conduct did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, Texas Austin.
“ I was concerned that if a woman behaved like this at any time, I would call it “historic ”, she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Committee on Justice of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh was protesting against rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasay Fordot in their teens.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he yelled, and his voice was screwed when he spoke of his family and years spent in high school.
In addition, he specifically condemned the Democrats of the Committee, who were accused of being ‘grotesc and co-ordinated character murder’, as well as the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by angry liberals.
Pelosi told me that he thought Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not fit for work at the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was caught up in opposition to the Democrats.
“I believe that he has ruled out what he said and the behavior he proved against the Clintons and Democrats, ” he said.
Pelosi was hesitateing when they asked if Kavanaugh would try to take responsibility, in case it filled the post, and if the Democrats would get the majority in the Parliamentary House.
“I say that if you do not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it is not only the Supreme Court, but not the court where it is right now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the capital Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that he was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh as a Democrat for the purposes of the Remuneration Act or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he excluded the questions that were asked if he would copy the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ There is no time for a hysterical, captured person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to tear ourselves apart from joy, ” announced Pelosi.
And women have to keep it in hand.
It's a legitimate run-out, it's been up for months and years, and he can't give up anger without crying.
“ We know when we’re angry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think this is so rare, do you?
“I had a great help with a woman who worked somewhere in a leadership position,” she continued. “ She told me that in her anger she was crying, but she developed a technique according to which, when she started crying in anger, she said to her conversation partner: ‘You may think I’m sad because I cry.
But I am angry.”
And then he continued.
And I thought that was a great idea.
Partly, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they were essentially misinterpreted.
One of my most alive memories of an early job, a man's office, where I once started crying in an angry inertia, that she grabbed an older woman in my neck – a cool manager I always was afraid of – and he took me to the stairwell.
“ So let them cry, ” he told me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they're upset.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democrat Congressman from Colorado, Gary Harttal worked on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an extra-marital reflector named Monkey Business, he came out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he realized that there was no reason why he couldn't start for the presidency himself.
“ There was no well - thought - out decision, ” she said to me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the contest, and the next candidate was wanted in the middle of their back.
Someone named it “The Whites and the Week’s Smurfs, ”
Since the campaign's been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, so he's agreed he won't compete unless he picks up $2 million.
Eleve was a defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave men $1,000, but he only got $ 250.
“ They thought I was going to get a discount, ” he meditated.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, the emotions were so wasted because of the thanks to the people who supported him and the frustration of collecting money and making voters more difficult to reach, and the rage of sexism, that the throat was broken.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” mentioned Ms. Schroeder, the press’s reaction.
\"They believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone?
“Sert””
How can the US-China Trade War be good for Beijing?
The opening fire of the trade war between the US and China was almost ear-to-mouth, and the same battle was not close to the end, according to experts, the break-up between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warnings at the beginning of the year by imposing a tax on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scenario this week was since the new duties are already product worth USD 200 billion, with virtually taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
Beijing has, in all cases, reduced its customs duties between five and ten percent to 60 billion US products.
China has accepted that it will be cut back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not succeed in the near future.
If you want to convince Washington to conquer, it would mean that you have to give the debate before the demands, but the public bending towards the US would be too embarrassing for Hssi Chin-ping, President of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing is well-tacted, the US's commercial war pressure could well come to China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing that could put any economy on the market is far more serious than that recognised by the observers,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant from Asia at the New American Security Department.
Syria, ready to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that he is ready to volunteer for refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the lost country in war for over seven years.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid Moallam claimed that the state of the country is getting better.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue the stability of the areas destroyed by terrorists, with the return of normal conditions.
We now have all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to escape from the economic measures that led to terrorism and self-determination, which affected their daily lives and their survival.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallam said that the Syrian state would be happy to accept all the help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that countries do not accept conditional assistance or co-operation that supported the uprising.
Europe got the Ryder Cup in Paris

I'm so happy I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the whole team, and I am happy to help, ” he said, following the victory of Garcia, who is struggling with emotions in Europe.
The staphetabot will be handed over to Jon Rahm, who beat the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, on Sundays 2&1.
“ I feel tremendous pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
