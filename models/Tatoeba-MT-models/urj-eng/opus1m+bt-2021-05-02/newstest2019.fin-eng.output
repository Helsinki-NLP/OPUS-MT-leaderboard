Eemel Kouki led Hurrika in the opening of his home profit... to Savo Volley, another victory.
After seven times in a row in the Mestarusliiga medals of the male volleyball, Hurritani-Loima started the season 2018-19 when Raision Lomu fell on Saturday 3-0.
From Romania to Finland, the most powerful player Eemeli Kouki was 22 points.
There were some vibrations abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there came a call from Loamaa.
Well, pretty soon we got the job settled, Kouki said.
Like Loumus, Tomi Rumpune's support for Koukia was also played at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo's 17-point match-specific agreement.
It's always important to win the opening game.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought an extra degree to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal tube is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective rotting
Miro Määtänen was 18 points as Savo Volley's most effective when the team dropped down to Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was very depressing, especially at the head of attack, but fortunately we got a broken victory.
At least I had no knowledge of a different download when I played against my former team, Mätänen said.
At the next Airport in the 3rd Series period 2000-01, Antti Siltala, who started his career, made 12 points.
Chief coach Jukka Tuivinen was pleased with many things.
Hall was a small, or tunnel in the ceiling all the time.
Well, that's a good file from home.
Miro was the king, and he played a good game too, so he said.
The last blind season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at the Pielaveden Sammo while he was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
The Star of Aka-Voley
In the period 2012-13, the winning Joni Mikkonen has also started this season strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Voley took up his season's opening profit after he poured the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well in its own place.
Today, there was a loss close, because we had a fourth drop in 17-21.
Some misdemeanor was dug, and the fifth lot came in, and Mikkonen said.
A few months ago, the most effective of the tigers in the finals was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buvids.
Landman Alexanders Kudrjashovs supported at 17 points.
We didn't get much of a shot at the guy's pickup, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital world chapter 1
Finland is at the top of the world’s human capital comparison, reports Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was one of the statistics.
In 2016, the peak was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed Finland.
Later, the Netherlands invested one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found in the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was made between Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the education level of the population, access to education, skills and health will be examined.
The World Bank has focused on economic growth in relation to human capital.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico in session, the local game ended without painting
The real Madrid goalner Thibaut Courtois stretched into the great towers, and the local game of the Madridian team ended with an unmanned tie-up late on Saturday at the Spanish football league.
Atletico of Madrid was the closest goal, but the Belgian captain, Courtois, was able to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times in a loan fight while he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation Fifa chose him as a goalkeeper for the year.
In Real, the best goal was Gareth Bale, but his shot was over at the end of the goal opening party.
After the break, Bale left the exchange because of the injury suffered by the passenger.
According to ESPN, the disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the painted Cristiano Ronaldo who moved to Juvenile.
The United States is now under attack against abortion law - A powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected candidate Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive voice of Kavanaugh could be reversed by a decision known as Roe Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has come over the years.
Incredible as it seems, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has made public work against safe abortion and received support from the majority of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas will be met, who has become the only doctor in the state of Missour because of legal blackmail.
An armed guard at the clinic tells us he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran churchmen’s association led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but it is not even necessary, a photograph of the woman who died of abortion itself.
The death rate was about 5,000 years in the U.S.
The legalisation of abortions was supported by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later on, in his presidential campaign in 1980, Reagan began to confuse religion with political constituents in order to hug.
His abortion stock also passed out to his successor George Bush's parents.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
The deeper core of the case is to gain the root cause of abortion politics.
When tax freedom was denied from religious organizations that supported racial separation, they became politically active.
A abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes of politics.
In writing this in the United States, there is a situation where a sec of sexual harassment has been shattered, but the President, who has taken the vote of religious justice on abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate, which several women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may have the right to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the status of electoral status.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, with great demonstrations at the border.
Some 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has attacked protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gazan border zone, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
There are two children among those killed by the Palestinian Ministry of Health: 12 and 14-year-olds.
According to the Ministry, 505 people are wounded.
89 of these were wounded from the bullets.
The army of Israel has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw up the troops of Israel with stones and explosions.
The army says that they have started using force, that the protesters do not break the border fence or seek it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza demonstrations since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
The wounded are 12 000 according to the UN Human Rights Commissioner.
The protesters called for access to the Palestinian families, from which the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
The Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions from the Palestinian side and helium balls have set fire to forest areas and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Santa won't be able to shoot himself.
Wigan's top couple, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have taken him down with a fight in the penalty zone.
The First Judge, Gavin Ward, let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tattoo was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left in the middle of a separatist Ward who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick of 85 minutes after Santa was poured out.
Ward looked like a punishing cloud, and Mario Vrancic blew up 1-0 in a win-win paint.
The Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Master's Series.
Last Saturday, QPR was born in style with breast muscles.
Work was good again for Puk.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended them without being tired.
Norwich's match was five in two weeks.
The team's moving on too much.
There's five winning pipes back.
Pedophilic assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 experiences of interest to children in Finland
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small part of women are experiencing at least some sexual interest in premieres.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Children or young sexually interested persons have so far been difficult to get help.
The SeriE project together with the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in spring, an e-mail tour was started in Sexpo to provide advice and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preferences against children cause shame for many.
Most of the pedophilic feelings in themselves have not taken place in their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, pleasure is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress them and depress them.
They are also challenging normal life, says Ylele's sexual therapy with Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child saves sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Leaders of the Coreos or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange suddenly, but Trump is one of the most popular prizes based on betting factors.
The background is the role of Trump in obtaining North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear terrorism.
Based on the reports of the greatest popular winners of peace, the South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korea, Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming between the baskets is significant, as last year the gap was good.
Yet, for years, the reward of Kim, which leads to nuclear threats and ironism, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be released from Monday, and Friday is the most attentionable, or peace prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have participated in the diplomatic process in Korea, there is one of the top candidates for the Congolese doctor, Denise Mukwege.
A respected Gynaecologist has been treating thousands of women victims of mass rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become leading experts in the world.
Mukwege has focused his work on sexual violence, which is a bitter by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been held by the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has stated that there are 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel got hurt.
In May, the reporter asked him in the White House whether he felt he deserves a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said I was smiling.
I want this to be done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea negotiations.
However, there are some things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Committee, which decides on the salary, has often recognised individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and multifaceted world order, is the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded by three US politicians, all of which have been democratic: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So it would take the Nobel Committee to reward Trump for an ideological full-time turn.
Fire report in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like warriors and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that happened in the North Pole happened on September 8th.
Due to the notice of the tunnel traffic, both Turku and Helsinki were cut off.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department sought to make transport normal.
But it didn't work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said that it could not be opened, because there are drivers in the pig blind, and they're driving how it happens, and then Pasi Kääriinen told his fresh-up to STT.
At that time, the motorway was driven in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, some others often follow, the traffic security contact manager, Tapio Heiskanen, is amazed.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop as for a forced reason.
Transport security reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, transport cannot be put at risk by degraded solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be provided with the greatest possible obstacle.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as is the adoption and withdrawal of the U translation.
The same prohibitions shall also apply in tunnels, which shall always be connected to the light on.
It is also prohibited to stop, as of course, parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, Heiskanen says in the Communication on Transport Security.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the lakebed
The Ilves fans of the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to remain on board to continue the prize party, even though the ship had remained on the lake floor, says Juho Syrja, the master of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on the way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove off the road late on Saturday night and stayed on the ground on the Oldwater Akaka.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was hurt in buddies.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party in the ship until morning, but it was certainly more reasonable to send them to the port and bus, Syrja said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the battle between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the Sire, Saturday's buddy was due to the water surface of the Oldwater being about a half-foot below normal.
According to Syrj, the nearest marker was also made difficult to see, therefore, its reflectors were not normally seen in the dark light.
No more mention of the collision
A fellow took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalm, shortly after the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
Greater drama was not associated with the case according to Syrja, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the bottom caused a more significant impact.
According to the surgeon, catching up on the bottom has not caused leaks or presses on the ship and the cruises on the ship will continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check out the ship's condition before the ship was driven off the mat.
For the sake of certainty, we are still going to the yard to check that this did not cause any damage, Syrja says.
Syrja believes that the next cruise of M/S Tampere, which is due to end next weekend, can be arranged.
The cruise period of the ship continues with him until the day of independence.
Not used for ambulances
The Rescue Department received an alarm on the case on Saturday night just a little bit after noon.
The port of Vienna was alarmed by ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
The day-to-day firefighter Matti Willman told me late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of darkness and a pretty hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency informed me half three after Sunday night that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers were transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cross-section ice, built in 1957, is past in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The judge of Trump, accused of hunting and drinking, may miss the state of the state of the art.
Brett Kavanaugh, as Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well stay in office which he has sought, assesses the Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in office for someone else.
There have been times in the United States that the candidate for the President's Supreme Court has raised a great deal of conflicts.
In that case, the judge has usually taken his own lead, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The designation would rain to the Laari of Democrats
The United States Supreme Court is seeking to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the new judge's choice has become a politically sensitive process.
According to Aaltola, if Kavanaugh is appointed, it is likely that the decision will be taken to the camp of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming elections of Congress.
It would raise the vote amongst young people and women who would be more likely to vote on democracy.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term profit for Republicans.
There is no chance for any presidential term, for judges of the Supreme Court will be appointed for life in the United States.
In practice, some of them have been retired on their own request from around 70 to 80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans hesitate to name
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally a background check, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has only ordered a week for an additional FBI report, Aaltola can still bring out something essential.
Yes, it may.
There's rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh's agreement or inconsistency will be discussed closely before his decision is taken by the Senate.
Republicans have a majority in the senate of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are considered to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the title would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
She identified Salisbury as an agent for military intelligence.
The Russian woman has told BBC that she identified Salisbury's poisoning as an agent for the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photographs, she told me that it was Anatoli Tshepiga, who worked at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they revealed the second poisoning of suspected men to the Chepiga.
They said before that they found evidence that current male identity is a covert person's depths.
The BBC group traveled to Far East near the border of Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified a young one from the pictures published by Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man as the British police, with a man called Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Scripal and his daughter with Novithok's nerve poison in March.
The Cripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded an honorary mark of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect's GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisonings previously reported in September in their interview with Russian TV as tourists in Salisbury.
Old people in waste bags in war reform
Now there is a live example of what the transition limit of the Social Reform, defined by the Sipilese Government, in practice, means.
The Sote services of Vaala will be created by the Oulunkaar municipal community, which was elected former Regional Director of Attando in 2016.
The Heads of the Association warn that the delegation will be limited.
If war spending is now rising, municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were alarming, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the institution of the health centre and a small unit of memory diseases.
Domestic care would be increased, which means long distances in Vaala that elderly people living in the remote villages are torn from their roots as a home to the health centre.
Intando trusted the municipality to pay it to customers.
The left of the poor was not swallowed up by bad preparations, but organised a good public meeting with many of its own, close-up workers, as well as other parties.
I introduced a war-country preparation in the divisions of how the municipality of Vaala is already treating the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Lännen was also authorised by the neighbourhood.
The local magazine made a big story about the occasion, and it once again raised the Oulunkar manufacturers to their backs.
Sote manufacturers don't write on any paper that Attando has built a new hospital in Vaala, now waiting for the residents to be empty.
There are no other service providers.
Preparationrs only talk about service exchanges, but do not tell us what level of treatment it receives or what kind of staff structure the Azando will treat the elderly until receiving treatment.
Without a nurse?
The place of establishment of the health centre is to be stopped because there is no medical emergency.
Attando will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of the danger is how central civil servants are run by qualified persons with incomplete knowledge and are authorized to point their back against the wall with a limit of change.
This is how the Central Party will free the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain safe there to live voluntarily if there is a chance of moving away.
Was there a statement from the centre that the whole country would be kept occupied?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a major toy in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened up the largest Moscower in Europe.
Several hundreds of people had gathered on the beach of the Rhine since the morning.
Erdogan, you are not welcome, read in the sign of protestors, and the demonstrations condemned Fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security has been tight.
About 10,000 people were expected to protest on the streets in Cologne, including Turkey's human rights situation.
There was also a gathering of Erdogan’s supporters near the Great Sprinkler.
However, the police had isolated the great area from the Muslim environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his German visit and assessed the relationship between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel pledged on Friday to rebuild their relations with the countries which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including regarding human rights issues.
Review Around Visit
Both Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of Nordrhein-Westphalia, Head of State, Mr Armin Laschet, both took part in the openings when the review of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he had come to protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They're under arrest, killed and underprivileged.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of the German trip to Erdogan in Nordrhein-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of the supplier
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the D.A. said that three people were charged with Kucia and this betrothetic murder, as well as other crimes.
Previously, this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and Italian mobs.
The police have suspected that the murders were linked to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of the Karjalainen on Sundays in the distribution areas
Due to the error of the result, the Karjalainen on Sunday will also have to be posted without an address.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in distributed areas where distribution to joint boxes is to be made of foreign memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra leaf bouquets in the county.
The leaves of other Finnish subscribers are only sent on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The editor, Arto Nyberg, is present today in his forthcoming discussion programme, including Vesa Heilalaa.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her coming space trip, which she already provided for the Virginia Galactica in 2010.
The price came from EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that, after the accident, in 2014 and even the death victim's trial, things are going to be fair.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or no later than next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, or his journey is scheduled about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in a state of weightless condition is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about his future homepage.
At the same address, he also uses a background for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw Star Trek's TVs.
The stars wars have been seen, and that's what the idea of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh master
Manchester City continued its lossless journey in Valoliiga, when it poured 2-0 on Saturday's home-field in Brighton.
The sixth victory guarantee for the ruling master team of the season is Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit from the distance of the season to empty paint when Leroy Sane found him on the back of Brighton's paint for 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his goal balance to five when he and Sterling saw the peace of Brighton as pieces of 65th gamemen.
The Argentinan was able to place 2-0 final readings at the scene of punishment in a easy way.
With six winnings and a single match, the season began by City leads Valoliiga to 19 points on catch.
However, Liverpool, less than a single match, is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his seventh round match at the Chelsea of the series.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi’s Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: “Gos to a very important driver.
The Swiss newspaper Blick's interview with the Britishist Mersun asked him, he believes that the liberalisation of Kimi Räikkös from Ferrar's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the period.
Hamilton leads Ferrar's other driver Sebastian Vettel at the MM points at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he was moving to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think that the Räikkönen would have hit the bar.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite shoes and I am convinced that Ferrari loses a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his ancestors.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed of formula one, I played F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, and Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
At 14 p.m., the game begins at the Mercedes Valtter Bottas.
The evening magazine's gonna be watching the race for a moment.
The championship of the A-nuorten SM series became a full farce: the opponent arrived in only 7 players' power
The top serial level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before 13 p.m., the starting points for the mestorus struggle were clear: FC Lahti Academy is in practice enough for the first time against the left IFK.
In order to turn the situation over in the last round, Ilves, second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and wish for the Lahtits to lose.
However, the Gulf championship was in practice confirmed even before the start of the festival, as the Vasa IFK had arrived at the Gulf with only seven players.
If there was one less horizontal, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won 16-0.
In the break, the layers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the scales is that the team has played in part the same players in the A-nuorte SM series, the P20 series and the 2C-section of men.
Vasa IFK has played in 2nd in practice against the fall of the season.
On Saturday, the second round of decisions, Vasa IFK has to win JBK in a foreign match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own foreign match against KuFua in Toivala.

Supo expects new ways of intelligence: No delay in the design of equipment projects and recruitments already carried out abroad
According to Supon's chief Antti Pelttar, there is provision for intelligence by carrying out equipment procurement and training personnel.
As the intelligence laws enter into force, an increase of around EUR 10 million should continue to be expected.

Tennis' superstar Serena Williams will be dating again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of the breast cancer by publishing a video with his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The map is the late 1991 I Touch Myself of the Australian The Divinyls.
The video on Williams supports the activities of Australia's breast cancer association.
“Mother’s world faith in The Divinyls to remind women to regularly carry out their own audits, ” Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women regardless of skin color everywhere in the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it scares a lot of lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
\"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us a hit song to remind women to put his health first,\" Williams says.

The Chinese restaurant on the mountain road is not suitable for high-speed women
In addition to the traditional Chinese yolks, restaurant serves great landscapes.
The Chinese province of Zhejiang has been opened with an exceptional restaurant.
It is literally a rock language.
If you want to watch the forest below, you can see it.
The Jylhäs landscapes at the heights allow restaurant visitors to bury their lives in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the peach trees.
Restaurant opened for visitors on September 19, 1958.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
We need a good base for the restaurant. We'll tell you where.
I'm running out of rubber today: this is how it ends.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is the way to the domestic country drama of Korpela's alley race, which has been quite held.
The third period of production has passed like hot stones: last week, the television was first produced by 722 000 Finns.
The top figures themselves no longer have any practical significance, for Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not coming forward.
In the final period, the relationship between the Germans and the Mirku will be taken again, and I think the mother of the Germans will guess the first thing I have to do.
In the light of recent events, Anssin and Miisa are also warm, romantic, but then there will be another appearance in the pictures of Laiho.
The police, too, are on suspicion of a man who's a lazy man.
But no one can imagine the fate of Laiho in advance.
You can hear some incredible news for Anita.
The last will of a long time will be revealed, which will bring a woman to the brink of tears.
A week after Sunday-illo, Sorjonen continues.
I'm gonna make up for the alley run tonight on TV1 at 21.05.
Do you think it's worth going to work in a little flu tomorrow?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether other people should be infected, as the disease may be contagious, even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the hiwis.
In the latter option, you may already be infected with others, even if your own symptoms are small, says the Prevention publication.
So you should stay home?
Prevention indicates that the flu is infected even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus will be infected by days before the symptoms start and then from five days to five weeks.
Children may be infected longer.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when coughing up and there's no fever anymore, says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
It is also worth avoiding training.
Too fast a return to the gym slows recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, put your nose on them, and throw your dirty paper in the trash.
But you're sick, though?
If you have to leave home as sick, consider using a mask.
Mask does not control viruses, but the user is aware of the area of the head.
That's when the fingers don't come in their nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezings are also limited to the mask.
Then how could the infection be avoided?
The best way to wash your hands is to avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, average human touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the mission: \"My man is a hockey player\"
The ice-creamer and the missus are often linked together.
This was also the case for Alina Voronkova, paragraph 23.
The 2018 Miss of the Finnish crown has received Alina Voronkova from Pertunamaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where he moved to when he was 15.
Alina's mother is inkerin Finnish and father is Russian.
The father's Russianity in Voronkova was bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russia.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina tells me at the semi-finalist release event in Miss Finland.
After upper secondary school, Alina decided to start at a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the missionary found new friends, and the Ark went to roll with hope.
At the age of 15, she thinks she's an adult, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonah Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After a career with a SM-liiga, ice-creamer has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the World Cup of 18-year-olds.
In the early days of the visit, a couple lived in a distant relationship of almost one year, but later, Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I were to gain the winner's triangle, and it would give me a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even though we have to live apart, we have a good side of trust and a good side in the distance that it will stay above the full time, Alina virnitus in May.
Continued growth by joy, death with our kinters
Almost everyone is concerned about the planet's sustainability.
Yet, there is little to give up.
Sustainable growth is sought, but the theory of court finances also runs into major problems.
Over a few generations, economic growth has brought to ordinary people, especially in the northern half of the world, a standard of living that only could be dreamed of.
However, the long-term overcapacity of the world and climate change will make this market economy’s rock foot be threatened.

Jori Lehtä's strong subpower play arose when his NHL Society Philadelphia Flyers played their last training game before the beginning of the season.
Philadelphia won the Boston 4-1, and Lehtä fed Michael Rafflin twice to paint.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere hit the herd in Pyhäärve - Highly caught on the rock track.
The inland navigation ship M/S Tampere drove to the car late on Friday night at the Pyhärvärve.
The Rescue Department received an alarm from a water traffic accident on Friday night after midnight.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has driven into a box, and is firmly attached to its neck on the rock, described the emergency firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on the boat.
According to the rescue department, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're being transferred by bus station to Tampere, told the emergency chief Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m.
The port of Vienna was alarmed by ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship who traveled from the Hämeenlinna to Tampere had driven off its way west of the narrow Jumusensalm.
The police will find out why what happened.
The day-to-day firefighter Matti Willman told me earlier that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of darkness and a pretty hard wind.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship doesn't leak.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will check what's on the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is an existing inland waterway fleet with a maximum authorised passenger capacity of 180 persons.
The ship also has to rent a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, cross-sectional ice has been lost in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers require Robert Helenius to pay outstanding fees
A boxer Robert Helenius's evening fight against Erka Teper will shadow money.
Mr Jaakko Helminen and the Vice-Chairman Jussi Kokkila announced today that Helenius would be charged with a total delay fee of more than EUR 80,000.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle it, but there's no other choice.
This has been a clear mandate, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanonom.
Helenius’ current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to the newspaper, which tells us about the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastinen, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically depressive situation to Helenius and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorships for him.
Unfortunately, Helenius was obliged to pay commissions only percentages of his matches.
Once again, Helenius was assured that there was no need to pay for anything, only to receive the revenue they organized.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on pay work and that would have been insane in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Vastinen, Helenius would have wanted to make a written agreement from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman only received a draft at the end of 2014.
He pointed out that the proposal was too bad for himself and that the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen had been cut off.
Helenius didn't think about dealing with Kokkila and Helminen once.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been identified as an inexplicable but massive decline in the work of the manager.
This year, the action has been brought up with the same arguments.
Helenius considers the latter activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be a poor country, in exchange for it.
Helenius is meeting today at Erka Teper's Stuttgart, the seventh edition of the heavy series IBF.
A Dear Man and a Good Journal
The entertainment artist and the music producer, Ilkka-Ile, felt the late radio driver and editor Erkki Päll for decades.
A long line radio driver and editor Erkki Päll died at 83 years old of incurable liver cancer.
The report of the drinker's death was published on Sunday in Helsinki's Sanam.
The report tells Päll's death on 3 September.
The sun told us about the serious illness on its Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who died of a familiar fate.
He's already left on Facebook as good-bye, Ile Vainio says.
The persecution holds Erkki Päll as a multiflorous student, who became a great journalist.
He reminds me of Päll's been a man who had fast boxers and funny things.
I learned to know Erk as a little boy when I first visited Finn's record and started there as a warehouse man.
That's when Erk and I met.
He was then a finnboard informant and in various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I first made music productions, there were hundreds of opportunities in which Erkki Päll was a standard editor of all the events he did at the party.
He was always competent and I saw the great fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got to the skin that he was interviewing directly.
He was a kind man and a good reporter.
For many, he became well-known as Yle’s radio driver, but he also wrote great journals.
Erkki also interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Valio thank you.
In the decade, Pälli worked in addition to supplier work in Fazer's record company with Hope Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the biggest passion on the sun was a radio work with his own unique style.
He was radio worker since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous listeners at the Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.

In the autumn of last year, we responded as quickly as possible to adapt.
The careful design of the operation and economic governance have been hit through our entire organization, Kulmala tells in the press release.
We have also been very successful in the procurement of our partners, and in addition to the profits of the world Cups were maximum in the past period of competition.
However, in future, cost management must also be accurate, and at the same time we must keep looking for new financial models.

Among the first ones, a military C-130 truck landed on the field, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please only allow the field to be restricted.

The rain wipes over Finland at night
The whole country spreads across the country on Sunday night, from westward to west, says the Climate Department.
The rain comes mostly as a water, but in central and northern Lapp is expected to travel or snow.
The last night's picky packages are not repeated because the temperatures under the cloud cover remain higher.
The darker night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively in check.
In the west right now, you can visit the packaging side, said the emergency meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will be diverted east by morning.
In the south and the west, there are pouts or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The starting week for thermal facilities looks similar in the southern and middle parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
In maritime areas, wind and waves are in place.
It is not expected that there will be any particular syllable storms for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typical autumn-changing weather.
Ilkka said.
You can't see Miss Finland's final on TV
IL-TV will allow you to follow the red carpet glamour and radiation of Miss Finland.
In IL-TV, the entertainment suppliers in the evening are pulling a live broadcast from the red carpet of Miss Finland from Billnäs.
Sending starts at 6:50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from ten finalists.
Miss Finland 2018 will be held in Billnäs' dress at Raasepor.
Before you start the final, you will be able to follow the tunnel from the top of the IL-TV live broadcast.
Live transmission starts at about 6:30 and goes on for about an hour.
A great deal has been invited to the Final this year, particularly for Miss Finland's previous years.
The jury represents them in the year 1998 by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are the well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammou, CEO of Joun's Chamber of Commerce Minttu Murphy-Kulanen and Lääka's news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he could get to the university before he went to the mischiefs.
Russian Dimitri's father and inkerile mother Svetlana believed their daughter's success in the Miss Finland Final.
The newly parents of Miss Alina Voronkov, Dimitri Voronkov, and Svetlana Voronkova, followed proudly their daughter’s first moments at the end of the year.
They came to the audience from Pertunamaa, and they were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful feeling!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before she came, she was getting nervous, and Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is inkerile and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks of a smooth Russian, even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than the career of the miss.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be missed.
But he told me he wanted to be a radio director.
Only later, Alina got excited about beauty competitions.
The parents wanted Alina to go to the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and finally, Alina wanted to do an investigation before the missionaries.
We've already asked why he didn't participate last year, but he wanted to complete the cover.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a healthy example for young people and adults too.
He's a lot of athletes and he's eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the front, and she's gonna see it.
Alina's boyfriend, Jonah Hurri, is working in Japan and has not been able to encourage Finland to love the final.
Alina's parents believe that the youth relationship will last for the 20th year.
Yes, that's what it's meant to be!
The parents wanted the daughter to be here soon.
It's been such a long break to visit the missionaries.
I'm sorry, though I've been putting messages.
A young man died in Lahti, the police caught three people.

Nor did the police comment on whether the people who were caught and the man who died in the past knew each other.
Further information on the case is available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became his home mother in Finland - I remember the idea of a cartoon: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, my husband, who proposed to be a person in the story I developed, said Espoola's comic blogger, home mother and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Mr Piippo says that he was an EU translator in Brussels on economic and legal matters until ten years ago, after the fourth child, the family became a returner.
I've enjoyed very well at home.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what it would do when the smallest kid started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture became a cartoon.
The bishop says he never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix when he was little.
I had been drawing last as a child, but when these natural manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
I first started making some dozens of manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (i.e. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I did not get her attracted until summer 2016 when I donated Viiva with the help of a drawing board.
His zeal lasted a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to start trying himself, laughing at Pippo, telling him that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
For Paper, I didn't even try to draw, says Pippo to draw his relationship, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but I usually don't make it at the same time.
There's going to be more than an hour in a three- Square strip.
I might make a screen at a time and play with the color.
To start drawing is always the most difficult thing because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells us that he appreciates the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
As individuals, the L theme has been shattered by a carrot-wave mother with a salad-sleek.
The other people are Man, Pissis and Doubles.
In the natural earth, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer forced bully even though there is an intrudement between the animals.
The bishop tells us he's reading his show with his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon and you say that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for your mother!
You can read the Finnish series online at the address of the creation shop.serial blogs.com

Rehn was thinking about Europe's leading role in the trade war: \"We should look at the following twiitt:
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said in Ylen's first claim that, although tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, reflecting investment decisions by companies.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
In Rehn's view, Europe is very good at bread so far.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States, and it has contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be on the feet of the commercial war by Rehn.
I'll have to look at the next twit and assess it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said yes in the interview.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is Italy's third largest economy in the euro area, one of the most debt countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Yesterday, the market was very close to the Italian Government's Thursday night to present clearly the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the stock of loans in the country is problem credits and unorganized loans are over 10%.
In addition, its public finances are in poor positions, and the country appears to be in excess of its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe into the new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in the well.
This distinction would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw his mission in a fair year.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name have been flawed in words.
I'm sure it doesn't matter if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment on this beyond this.
HS's super popular Black Box performances continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsinki’s Word continue to take place again in the next week.
Other presentations will be held at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23, the Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere performance has been sold out.
The flags are sold by Lippi.fi.
During the evening, suppliers and photographers on the stage will report a long-prepared true story that has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that no one's ever heard of.
“I’m a strange spy at the night of Helsinki, an impressive report on the other side of the earth and a speaking story on a very topical health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet and continue the debate with the suppliers and photographers of HS.
The words of Helsinki have organized the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the audience.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier galaxy as a journalistic act of the year.
The servants thanked the new way of making journalism and journalists want to come close to their readers.
In the spring season 2019, a black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance is also visited in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the presentation will have different content than in this syllable night.
The lost canister was found due to an unexploited experiment.
The Finnish police's drone skills are the world's top: \"We're asking for training,\"
According to the police college principal, the police can use drones in addition to missing searches, for example in crime scene investigation and intelligence missions.
The Oulu police managed to find a drone missing in Raah on Tuesday, only in a few minutes.
Chief Kimmo Himberg of Police University quoted the case and mentioned, among other things, that we are also at the top of the world through an unexploited experiment and effective training.
Drone's quite a new one, and that's even more recent in police work.
There is no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police are the champion of the use of drones.
According to the Himberg, there is a strong idea that this is the case.
This has been made clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
It's very interesting to see it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the Finnish police's drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
More widespread
Himberg recalls that finding missing persons in winter conditions in Finland is of great importance as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost was found with the drone only within a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himbergi says they're meant to be trained more.
Drone is already being used in police tasks a great deal, and its use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
That's what I'm afraid to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain intelligence missions.
For example, we already need to check out a area a little further, which may be feared to face violence there.
Drone can then be used for advance intelligence.
Karjala Rugby rose to number one.
The Karjala Rugby party at Kuopio on Saturday, the 2nd edition victory.
In the middle of the match, the Italians were still in the middle of 7-12 to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and dry the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew the historic rise of Karjala Rugby to its 1-division.
In the past, the Society has played in number one, but at that time Finnish rugby's serial activity had been divided into two levels, the SM series and its multiple 1-division.
The Society is going to take the show, but next winter, it's going to know quite a job.
The current poor 20 player's roster must be raised to 25.
1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so it must also be in line with the acquisition of funds.
Kotkaniem starts the season in Montreal, confirms the main coach
The Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, Jääkiekon NHL, confirmed the following on Twitter account that the Finnish eater Jesper Kotkaniemi will begin the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise for Kotkaniemi, in the first round of 18, at three summer reservations.

Julien, the head coach, praised the Finnish authorities for the major development plans since the arrival of the guest camp.
The NHL hull series begins next week on Thursday night.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening tour.
What is a good leader?
This week Finland has been talking a lot about leadership.
In his interview with HS, the Chairman of the Government of Google, Risto Siilamaa, announced his book Paranoid optimisticly, where he illuminated the philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Olllila was strongly denying the accusations, but in the past, there has been talk of the leaders' inability to act as a team; of fear and incompetence, in which mobile business was caused by a collapse.
The company's ability to take risks in the rise phase and the disk was lost.
In Helsinki, the business event Nordic Business Forum was also held during the week, which attracted the business club of Finland to the Exhibition Center.
In addition to Barack Obama, the 12 stars of business worlds rose to the stage.
We're done talking about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader should dare to take the company to the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most spiritually involved in past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of a wide-ranging chain of organic foods, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the whole staff the purpose of the company.
And that can't just be a win for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the Introverts of the success book, told me that the most successful leaders are the subjects under investigation.
They operate calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often, they're introverters.
Professor Aswath Damodara, financial sector professor, pointed out that the characteristics of a good manager must be one of those of the company's life cycle.
At the start of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
The company that grew up in a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These guides at the Nordic Business Forum were listening to 7 500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had an information leak.
It's a lot to call a good leader.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, including at the highest level.
Siilamaa and Olllila were also present.
They used to talk to each other in a similar manner.
Yet, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Noah at the right time.
It was not easy for them to assess their humility.
Sara Chafak arrived in a beautiful red carpet right from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
Malla Sara Chafak arrived at the missionary in a beautiful black dress.
In 2012 Miss Suomen’s dress was also found in the valley of picsine.
It's a bit of a box of Jet Leggy.
I came back from Los Angeles.
Long ago, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's doing.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. for auditions.
He's been doing commercials, among other things.
In the United States, he describes it as interesting, and also as it is in Finland.
However, work must be done more hard with him, as the work of the model can easily be replaced.
You gotta push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Koreography for Sonya Lindfors 30 000 euro live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth EUR 30 000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, who received the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, social activists and teaching.

The award will be awarded annually to an artist or group operating in the field of live art.
The Danish police found a large Volvo on the mission: \"We can't tell you what to do.
The Danish police's extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Juutinuma and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Sjärlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS was set up by the Head of Unit of the Central Media Centre of Copenhagen.
Found the car.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet. Henrik Storm from Copenhagen police reports to Ilta-Sanonom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo that we're looking for doesn't say I'm in direct contact with the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police about Saturday's press conference.
The investigating director, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was at the expense of a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us what kind of crime is being investigated.
However, Skov said that it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been found in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on cargo transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed events with their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public is no longer concerned about the threat of certain people.
The name of Macedonia has brought about decades - now the people will vote on it in the elections at issue.
In Macedonia in the Balkans, the proposal is currently being put to the vote as a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of Northern Macedonia should be named.
To date, Greece has blocked its right of veto in Macedonia's efforts to become NATO and EU members.
According to Greece, its name belongs to the northern region.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but I wonder whether the voter is in favour of the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by adopting the agreement.
The vote began on a vertical basis at at least a school in the centre of the capital of Skopje.
The retired nurse, Olivera Argirovka, who voted at school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum means a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts in 1991 for the independence of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
The national-level right-of-right position, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called again for the referendum to be adopted.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the vote will rise by more than 50 %.
The referendum is not binding, but yes-voting victory would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations will be closed from the middays of Finland.
That's a great victory!

Students pretend to be rare: ancient tragedy - a simple Oreste affects their visuality
Ancient tragedy is rare in Finnish scenery.
For example, there has been an ancient tragedy at the National Theatre, Soofokleen Firoctetes in 1988.
Now, the Theatre High School brought an ancient all-time drama trilogy, Aishylus Orestean, to the beginning of the National Theatre.
In the early 2015 Lavak Open! projects, actress students at the Theatre School work internationally with the professional supervisor.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, located in Berlin.
The first international night of her first night in Berlin received Oreste in April.
Roihan’s reconciliation from Orestea will bring together the report on the end of the Atreus family, which was sentenced to destruction and the birth of the rule of law, with a maximum of twenty minutes, especially by increasing the proportions of choirs.
The work will succeed in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon's great Finnish (2003) spirit.
The dramatic lights and theatre pages reveal the appearance of a fearful and bright vision.
Its center consists of the dynamics between the performers that are disengaged from the shell, the name rows, and the shell.
The presentation uses both double- and three-thirds of the nominal roles.
Actors are not leaving the scene at all, so, for example, the murder of Agamemnon returning from the war of Troy and Kassandra in this war hall is shown on display, unlike ancient pre-straditions.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasise that it is faithful to ancient pre-strads.
Rather, in front of the viewer’s eyes, a modern interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out the Master's phase actress students as a close group, directly as a single organism, a rhythmic group.
Especially in the shell particles, very expressive, maze-like group formations, quick-feeling actors are able to get their rights exposed, only by cleaning the white curtain, on display.
That's impressive.
Orestean performance tour continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

A long line radio driver Erkki Päll is dead
The Erkki Päll, known as the long-term supplier of Ylen, died of cancer at 83 years of age.
The radio driver Erkki Päll, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, we're on our way.
The doctor has also said that I live day by day, he commented on his situation in Malta a month ago.
We need to ensure the security of the premises and places of trade.
For the first time, I got paid for the magazine stuff in 1984.
When this year’s rings amaze me, it is usually a big news issue.
When I wrote (Carrian, 27.9.) about the safety of retail workers, I was astonished and, at times, I was a little angry.
I also talked to the case about the work environment specialist Erika Kähärik, a trade union in services.
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim something else.
The police know only clearly serious cases and many real violence situations remain unreported.
Of course, businesses have a duty to statistics close to the labour safety legislation, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect any information, he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that there are not always physical injuries.
In spite of this, psychological trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threat of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat must also be counted as violence - even if there is no access to it.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if it doesn't happen.
Some of the residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
When the opening hours of shops were released, even in the media, the apparent steaming time was high on its impact on the safety of the sellers.
“At the same time, many employers arranged security services for at least nighttime feelings and for the prevention of work alone, ” Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, as a result of security, the disturbances remained well under control, an image was created that security would be unnecessary.
In many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
A slight abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives close to the trade.
However, according to the law of 2011, a slight abuse will become subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think there is a need for a case-by-case.
The next time the trade aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecution should be charged.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from the hard end of the sentence, the customs would be cooled.
A society where the food trade must be open for almost a day at small places must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed up for the miss before the beginning of the direct shipment, Sara, Iiro is married.
It's not this year's Mass Collection that we're seeing in the traditional way of TV, it's the delivery of the Viafree website.
Former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplayn NHL and KHL students host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are running as Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the runner's threesome told the invited guests and media representatives about the cost of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula some fresh applause.
Now all women scream!
Now, look at this man-runer, Sohlberg's fellow man was glowing at the audience.
The front race is followed by many previous years by Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Siepp sat next door and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg would lock him in the direction of Saras.
The more I think Sohlberg just referred to the divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comments, even though it seemed confusing at first.
For the first time, Sieppie spoke of his divorce in the newspaper of the weekend of the East Sanoma.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open the reasons for the distinction more in public, as it is between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he wasn't busy with a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focused on my own things, and especially the industry living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage became even more evident at a later stage when Sohlberg was mistakenly mistaken to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula as a wimp.
The drinker's threesome laughed at me.
Iroro was married, wasn't she? Or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed a mess.
The Northman tortured himself by cutting, burning, and feeding a strong saucer
The Supreme Court of North has condemned the many crimes committed by a man who lived in Kokkola 34 years of age for three years in prison.
Among other things, the crime was a belt, cable and flags.
The court condemned these objects to the State.
He was guilty of a serious rape suspect.
However, this accusation was rejected.
Four abuses, gross assault, forced rape, illegal threat, a violation of freedom, a serious conflict of freedom, and two damage were considered.
Crimes occurred between 26 and 24 May last March.
At the end of the last act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
Last week, on Thursday, the Northwest District Court gave its judgment and ordered 34 years of age to continue to be held in Vaasa's prison.
No evidence of rape
34-year-olds were also accused of two serious crimes of freedom and of gross rape of May 22.
However, these accusations were rejected as evidence.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the judge gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats, and forced action in situations where this had been committed.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned on a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the State to have lost criminal instruments: belt and cable, caps, bath belts, knife, and toilets.
Four Witnesses
According to the Court of Justice, the parties continued their life together.
It is clear from the statement that a large proportion of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
The victim’s 34-year-old should pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm.
He hardly has that money, because the condemned already have old debts in his inheritance.
The imprisonment is not the first of a man's life.
The newspaper doesn't give a convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case in writing.
Europe’s 4-point lead to Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals held up their leadership on Saturday in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup point to be played on the flames of Paris at 10-6 when there are still twelve twelve games to play in front of Sunday.
Europe won three out of four Saturdays of four-ball games, and the winnings were 2-2 in the fourth game of the afternoon.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.

HJK condemns its supporters in the Honka Harvest match: \"The power is not included in football.
On Sunday, HJK published a notice in which it condemns the behaviour of its supporters in a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
\"We are calling for our supporters after the Honka-HJK match,\" says the press.
At the end of the deal, about 50 HJK supporters ran into the field and some seemed to try to challenge Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organisers did not get the situation calmed down, but they needed police officers and also horsemen.
HJK reports that the team's players and employees are shocked about what happened.
The events after the trade are not in line with the values of our usual 111-year-old association.
“We are going to take a steep leave of all activities that jeopardises the safety of matches events,” says the Communication.
HJK's consent will help authorities and organisers to identify safety threats and eliminate mild phenomena.
Support culture is part of football and it is important for HJK.
We all support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football clubs.
\"It's not the authority,\" says the press.
The Filipino inventor is flying on a drone car so we can avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Pelton.
He's now part of a growing crowd in the world that swears he's invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors like Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he did the first successful test flight... he flags his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will produce positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
The JHL forecast: tomorrow’s work fighting activities are visible in day care for children and in social and health services
In public and well-being areas tomorrow, over-work and shift bans will appear in particular in social and health services and children's day-care services, and the JHL's President will evaluate the day Niemi-Laine.
The impact will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there is not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone's going to have to think about how to get their kids.
The employer's task is now to ensure that services are played and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the employees' poverty was also visible at the beginning of the year when the JHL members were in a ban on overwork and shift due to the negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, to have not been hired, but to have been overworked or replaced by workers.
This isn't a work combat operation yet.
It is, in terms of safety at work, a normal matter for each worker to have a regular working time and only to do so.
The JHL is opposed to the government's intentions to reduce the protection of the dismissal of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director-General for the Labour Market of Local Workers, is not going to take forward an assessment of the effects of bans on over-work and exchange.
However, he does not believe that they are very complicated, even though services may be impaired.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have prepared what is possible.
The area is so vast, social and health measures and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week we have already had experience of activities similar to Tehy, including the Super and the Social and Health Trade Association.
Their effects were rather limited.
The JHL Overwork and Exchange ban concerns, among other things, municipalities, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers have been excluded.
At this stage, the fight concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, the activities of JHL may last for a long time.
The Union will also be prepared for other work combat measures if there is a continuing preparation of the termination act.
The government should now admit that this is where I run into the wall and hard.
Mr. Jalos said that both the Ay movement and the government must resist.
It's special here that the hard guys are already in the pipe, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalone is updating.
The great Korallirity is born in the gymnastics of children and adults, studying the creatures of the trout and the sea horse.
In other areas, the Great Corallirius of the Collegiate Collegiate received his first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented in Finland, this time in Kannelto.
Like the earlier works of the group, the Great Corallirity is a work that is built from the beginning to the end with the public.
This time, however, a clearer proposal will also be built, which will refresh and thank the findings of the initial exercises.
There's plenty of rainy magic in the theater play for children's participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase.
However, there is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children work together.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into exercises and joint stamps also reduces the distance between adults and children.
Much of the Korallirity reminds us of the pitfall, fitness circle, and natural awareness, but it is finally in other kinds of non-human conditions around visits.
The great Koralliria begins to explore the business lines of corals and corals and fish.
In the six different districts of fitness, there are among other things the lifes of a raisin and a sea horse.
Finally, a little hour-long presentation will be made, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you to get to know the life of the coral ring.
In the Great Corallirut, there are both divers who observe the life of the coral rite and the corals that we look at.
There are also bodies looking at corals.
The views and observations shown in many directions make the presentation frequent and life dazzling.
Whether it's the landscape of some kind, the landscape-looking body, and the other organ or landscape that looks at the body, and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem any difficult.
In other areas, the group is working on a line of thinking and action to catch up when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, child involvement makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitor will have a silent demonstration for the endangered corals.
The destruction of man’s understanding must not be tough, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of self - pitying in the face of destruction.
In other places, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of information, other species and future generations for which to wonder and toy it will be a fresh space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad my childhood wasn't smart phones.
Children and young people today are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking tobacco all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and they should not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex because others say they do so.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to get his fifth-class sister over the weekend from a boy friend.
When he came to get his drunk sister, he told me about his sex experiences that night.
I can't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our childhood that we can't touch drugs and sex is an adult case.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls in Instagram, who are in their images make-up makeup and reveal clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used for taking and sending images that reveal the evenings.
It's harder for girls to think what age they are.
At present, 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-olds and also parents.
My childhood was composed of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I had to have a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people thought of me.
Yle: Officials have told the Head of State that the case of Airisto Helm did not involve national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, Ilkka, the defense police and defence forces that were interviewing the defence and foreign elections earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been informed that the Airisto Helme investigation is not currently involved in national security, but in organised crime, news of Yle.
The information from the sources that were not mentioned was confirmed by Mr Ylele, Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and Defence Police were present this week in the Defence and Foreign Affairs elections.
This is considered primarily to be an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be more, Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to the above data, no evidence has been found so far of the link with national security, but the investigation is only under way.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there, one of Yle’s interviewers notes.
A week ago, the extensive search for home in Turku and on the continent has raised the question of whether research is a matter of purely economic crime or a threat to Finnish internal security.
The evening magazine prepared a story this week, which will examine the arguments both on behalf and against.
Video: The dream medal saved the series that Liverpool lost.
Liverpool's 100 percent of Valoliiga's start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfying team at 1-1 game in Stamford Bridge.
Sunday is the same year that Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to 1-0 visitors.
That's when Pep Guardila's combination sent a signal from the entire Valoliiga that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's Manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same idea in West London.
Reds had begun with the six consecutive victorys of Valoliiga.
Liverpool began stronger and, in particular, Virginia van Dijk seemed to rule alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a well-sustained high-lying overcut on Anfield Road during the Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard came up from the exchange bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first sprung in a small space with the trio of Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard sinking forward and sent this perfectly weighted breakthrough.
Hazard got a little bit on the side of the penalty zone, but he bombed the back corner of the full left foot.
Half the Brassinvah, Alison, was a little slow in her fight, and she didn't get her finger on the ball.
I'm sure Klopp felt the defeat position a little unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger fell off the Mo Salah’s command line.
In the second episode, too, Chelsea Veskari Kepa got to work.
Baskivahti reacts quickly to Sadio Manén's bet and pushed the ball from the top of the ball into a corner kick.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed the throwing through Hazard.
The best place for visitors came by 72 minutes after James Milner found Bobby Firmino at his center.
However, the Brassler's bag was directed toward the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the host's leadership.
Nor could it last 89 minutes when the exchanger Daniel Sturrridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturrridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to glory in the upper corner of the unresponsive bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent overboard was completed with a 1-1 game, but it's still too far apart, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the masterpiece with two points behind the tip.
The clock transfer debate is deep.
I remember when a few decades ago a magazine asked various Finnish actors, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskisen's answer was the only one I could think of: Nen's head.
Some of the last names have a nose head and some don't.
After all, the Jakolinja can be born anywhere, and there was one waiter here.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock transfer is being abandoned.
A lot of people agree that the clock shift twice a year has been a fool's job and caused a wide variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest phase of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide which time it will eventually end in: the current summer or winter or other time zone.
This is also the way for the people to say their views on the sample.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is intense in the coffee table and social media, and everyone has their words to say.
By the influence of morning light on human well-being and summer time, the defenders of wintertime defend the influence of nightlight on people’s desire for outdoor activities and thus on the well-being of people.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies also indicate that the morning light is causing man’s day to be broken and gives him rest.
On the other hand, if it is not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, light increase the movement of people outside and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn events.
The additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated to an hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but we'd rather not be able to do anything in the north part of the earth.
The winters are too dark and summers for many too bright in any case.
A typical debate on the subject is that it is driving its own view and that the second view is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the counterparty is not just to listen, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Because almost everyone has an opinion on this matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn one’s head around.
It's going down.
The subject is a terriblely easy argument, since it does not require a great deal of commitment and the argument is sufficient to give rise to the knowledge of the mud.
In other words, similar types of issues are usually more steep and equally infertile.
Well, that's too bad if the wrong option gets elected, but I wonder if you'll be able to adjust to it.
And it also always offers a proper sinpuss if life feels like a monkey.
Josba was fighting for an alien.
Josba's first guest game in Divar of Salibandy produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left the Walloon on a trip home with a great 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo continued to paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Ettu and Juuso Lehhtiniemi ran into 6-5-protein.
For the icebergs of both teams, crucial minutes were played on the flat.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fireproof anyway when Teemu Tukken (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Mika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
Josba's got six points after three sets.
Next, O2-Jyvaskylä will be here in two weeks.
In Eno church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated in some very sad atmospheres on Sunday.
A week ago, the destruction of the church at the climbing risk was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, it's still a place to celebrate today.
Although no one would like to do so, Eno is the oldest church in the community of Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the local and other covenants of the world.
Family fair starts at Eno Church today at 10:00 p.m.
After that, the congregation house will be moved to a livestock table at the edge of the livestock table.
The program has all kinds of things in and out all day.
For example, in the church building, you can get to know the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, who has retired for 37 years as a congregation master.
The church’s birthday also means the end of one era.
Already out of use, a church house built in 1982 keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're at the old municipal building, the Japanese Markku Koistinen says.
The church house destroyed the problems of the inner air, but the church has stood healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk is forced from the head of Tesla's government's speech... to settle the fraud charges for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed their case with the US Securities Market Supervisoring Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of a securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being left behind because of the company he established.
However, Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to depart from the President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company's gonna have to hire the president of an external government.
Musk will also be subject to more strict supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor Musk's communication more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both cost $20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
“The Regulation is intended to prevent new market disturbances and disadvantages to shareholders of Tesla,” says Steven Peiki SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
Tesla's stock exchange took place at the moment.
SEC suspected Muski was guilty of a security fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that he would sue the company and Musk.
SEC stated that he was demanding that Musk be sentenced to fines and that he should be banned from acting under the leadership of stock exchange companies.
The SEC's challenge was driven by investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong fall.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia’s wake and tsunami
In Indonesia’s earthquake and subsequent tsunamis, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, reports the National Disaster Agency according to the AFP.
The number of victims of death is still expected to grow, as it is in the middle of solving the damage.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Please, on the island of Sulawes.
Immediately after the strike, there was a warning that was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least until now Palusta.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Dongala near the centre of the lake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Now many people are known to be dead.
Calm calls for help
The Indonesian army has been alarmed to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived today, called on the soldiers to continue rescue without evacuating the day and night.
One of the central points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to be 50-60 people in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, reported that one person alive was buried at night in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, popular by business travelers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, heavy defrosting equipment would be quickly digested in the lake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones in the lost.
Help me, you guys at Palu and nearby.
My friend's family still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
The phone numbers of politicians leaked into the hands of the barges in Britain
Many British politicians were disturbed when their contact information was leaked because of the deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The alarms were able to access telephone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party.
For example, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Development, Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, became victims of harassment.
A number of representatives of the people received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public received access to the profile of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party.
The audience was able to access profiles using the political e-mail address that was easily available online.
The profile lets you look at and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile for a moment into a porno and title insulting.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was changed from the media module Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows the registration of other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then you can check the contact details of the profile person and even if you send messages in this name.
The meeting application was made out of the telephone number of each supplier, politician and participant in the public, Foster criticised.
The keeper of the Conservation Party asked for an information leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and that the application is now working safely.
ICO, the British Information Authority, supported the leak.
The application was made by Australian Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the Opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finnish audience each week has a large number of returning Poles
Watchy viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The Wall, which was rapidly spread around the world, ran Finland's version of Fours last Saturday.
Heikki Paasonen's host game show is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made in the format.
In Poland’s studio, the possibility of description was exceptional, as the big 12 meters of the format required space from space as high playing walls.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the programme's studio audience, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, there was a conversation about whether the Poles might be sitting in the studio about a game to be played in Finnish.
The head of the four domestic programs, Ulne Sormunen, gives an illustration to the newspaper.
He tells us that there are players close to the studio, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international killers in Finnish production, just like the public in the Wall sections described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are so-called professional associations that are present in the descriptions of different programmes, sormunen will be re-educated.
He recalls that following the game in itself is not so difficult to explain even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls from the wall can easily be separated.
However, interpreters are present at the foreign - language studio, which carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the event as a simultan block to the studio controller all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of soda is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was active in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago in Talent Finland's pictures.
He always had a simulation in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in the illustrations in Finnish, the sum of the ring.
In the south of Japan, a rarity over the main islands, the authorities warn of earthquakes and floods.
Authorities also warn about possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifun Tram, but, according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there is currently no record of the deaths.
On the South Okinawa Island, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK general radio company, people have been evacuated into shelters and the electricity has been cut off from more than 300 000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to take place near Osaka during half a day of Finland’s time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route to the storm, but there are also hard winds and rains.
The train has been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to regulators, Trami tortures Japan all the way to Monday.
The Messiah's heaven has become more darkened
It's been a bad start.
The sky's dark is almost as long as the team disappeared on Saturday from its home base to Vaasa Sport with reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The pores now have five consecutive losses, and the points of the six round are in total two.
No Ässie defender or two lower chain players have yet to paint.
The pressure is also growing all the time.
The point is, when the game was almost half left, you'd be out of line for the audience.
Six games are only being played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, there must be some concern, because that's how weak we played.
Especially in the second batch of performances was a shame, and the effect on Ässi was 1+2 made by Jarno Kärki.
Of course, the victory for the sports was good.
The team had less than a game on Friday, so it would have thought it was going to be visible.
Well, maybe it did, but you didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the day of the bread continued to increase
Mother Pirkko Horrinen wonders about the public number of the event at the big hall.
In some way, it was thought that maybe this year there would be not so much people, the Good Lord would think about the day of the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Traktorikynna's SM competitions were held at the same time as the playday, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of people could even fall slightly from the year before.
However, it was different; the corridors were already retreaded again before ten, the sellers told the products that they had finished, the timber was sold at almost 500 doses before, and the number of cars that the Goodrinen heard was rising.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, Hürinen will tell you later this afternoon.
At five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a great deal of program for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to the record prize.
In addition, Heroinen estimates that the event will be more far-reaching.
The sellers also curve Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, rapporteurs, handicrafts, bakers and harvesters had arrived almost 100.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hürinen, wanted to see the audience in the hall.
The harvest was blessed at the beginning of the day.
In the children's series, the beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemi won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
Marjata Vepsäinen, the winner of the Ruislejoy competition, spent the day in the marts' pie shirt.
7 x most beautiful luminaire - this is where you'll recognize a good lamp
Wake up the state of life, create the right atmosphere for interior design and read the book without tireding.
Good lighting is worth a hundred.
We gathered together three good reasons to bet on lighting.
Vinkit gave Innolux CEO Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor for your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more age years are behind.
Enough light can help many people with problems with age when the accuracy of the vision decreases and more people suffer from shame.
Parents also increase the need for light.
Sixty-six needs light three times more than twenty-six.
So, for health reasons, it is worth a hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred for the light handling effects and the characteristics of the lamp.
I was good enough to give you enough light, but I'm not ashamed of something.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The designer of this moment has the right to choose.
There is a Japanese style that combines live, Scandinavianity and Japaneseity.
On the other hand, his inspiration from the 70s has also been modern and play retrotyl with its colors, with different shades of metal or with ice creams up to the boom.
The authenticity is fascinating in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bampu.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being put into the house than before, and the design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, a customized, bold whale is wanted to have a story to tell.
People are clearly applying for Finnish and Nordic products with known origin and designers.
So let's be very design-informed, something says.
Homes may not be able to obtain the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Some of the timeless, earless and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, says something.
Thank you. Good-bye.
KoKoo showed the door to the Canadian eater after three games
Koon Koon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are getting very bright.
The Canadian performer played three league games in orange music without power points, KokoKoo tells us in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August by a one-year agreement, which included a lasting trial period at the end of September.
During the last season, 26-year-old attacker played in KHL in Kunund Red Star lines and in the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The gamer wants to set an example for recycling - things go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changes in paper.
In addition to games, the game is now recycled by the player, as well as packaging materials.
The products of the stone retail store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
For example, the products ordered from the online trade are packed into packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us go to re-use.
We may use boxes tens of times as long as the package is in order that you can use it, Ville Pupurula of Oulu will tell you about the player.
As soft materials, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
The rubber door is as far as it can be.
In the near future, we are supposed to be moving to the recycling material even in the envelope.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Purula, recycling is not a cause for extra trouble.
It's not a big problem, it's starting to recycle.
It will also have financial savings when, for example, cardboard packages are re-used.
In addition to new products, the main range of the movement is the game and equipment used, among other things.
Every fashion-sensitive acquisition: One and the same shirt works each
The classic clothes work from the season to the other outfit.
They create a good foundation for the garderob with their multi-use content, as it is easy to collect different inhabitants at the expense of the high-quality classics.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black pole.
The black needle made of natural material may not have a flawing effect.
The claim can be combined with both direct pants, tyloids and jeans, and it can be used to create both a controld housing and a dirty style.
The seminee is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create the style.
Syksy's trend list is made of gold-brown and broad-flavoured, black-breeded and gray ankles.
The classic semine, together with other classics, blue green scotch and wine-red licensees, make up a female and sophisticated population.
Brings the black half-breed to the shirt by combining it with the tyre's trendy clothes: the tail skirt, high boots and thick pantyhose.
It's young and stylish!
The sabotage activity of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this practice.
During the Soviet Union, sabotage activities were specialized by the so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from Russian-speaking words, diversionno-razvedyvatator group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the KGB of the Soviet Union's security service are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh, the archive manager of KGB's west of Finland (1922-2004).
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil processing plants and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired DRG groups of Bundeswehr, railways, track guards and road workers' uniforms and accessories for undercover operations.
This trick was used by the Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police bras, set up inspection stations for you and isolated Crimea from their motherlands.
In the cold war, the agents hid sabotage groups with land packaged mines, explosives, lighters, and media.
Another year in 1998, the KGB’s stash was found in Switzerland, which was set to explode when it was sprayed by the authorities.
The police were looking for four bikes in the county at night.
Police caught up on different sides of North Carolina on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, a 18-year-old coniola man blew 1,57 promilles.
He drove two passengers in his first ride to Kajaanti at the beginning of the night.
In the Polvijärve Kuorvaantian, the car was closed at four nights, and a 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, blew up 1.54 proms by the police.
He didn't get any serious injuries out there.
In the centre of Outokummu, a 20-year-old foreigner who was driving a passenger car blew up the alchemometer by 1.33 promimet.
The police also suspect these male drivers as a serious driver and the driver of Polvijärve as well as the risk of road safety.
The 36-year-old man transporting the local van at the Öllöllölänja and Hoikintie crossroads in Tuupovaara blew up 0.52 promilles.
He's suspected of being a rat drinker.
The police are asking for observations on the incident after midnight at the Turku Railway Station.
According to the police, a man was assaulted at the parking lot with life-threatening consequences in front of the station.
He recorded it on the surveillance camera.
Dark hair suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets left immediately after the stabilization with a dark farm car to the Ratapika bus station.
One suspect left on a bicycle in the middle of the Humaliston street.
A pedestrian died after being frozen under a bus in Pori
In the staircase, the pedestrian died early on Saturday morning after the bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4 p.m. on the Ramantika Niintumaa.
I don't think the bus driver is suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the season, the trial period of Lehtinen ended
Mika Reutla, the sports director of the Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (mainly).
Filip Riska, who played in the first-symphony, continues in Hämeenlinna's HPK for the rest of the season.
An experienced Riska 33, the success in the roles offered to her confirmed the leadership.
Filip has been an important piece for us at the beginnings, in the field of subpower playing, and in the defence role of the four-field.
Even though we still find things to improve, it is good for the young team to hold on to this experienced player, Head of Sports of HPK Mika Lumula commented on the Society's release.
According to the hope, Riska's value will rise to the hockey league when playing the league's solution games.
Riska, the central eater from Pietarsaari, has played the league before in JYP, Luko and Sport.
In contrast, Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after probation.
The truth of today's TV: The climber was left to die twice.
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
Tonight's film is made based on them.
Everest now receives his first night at the Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers in Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guidance tells about a survival test that has been dealt with in the field of cereals.
The tragedy has been made of films and documents before.
The real events will also be carried out in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took eight climbers' lives 22 years ago.
Two of them were pilots of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just Hall was our guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could have saved the eye surgery that took place before he left Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost sight, which is why the rebellion had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on a trip and never came back.
However, the fighting of Weathers about life and death had just begun.
When he got up, he got lost, and he couldn't find him back in the camp.
When a man came to find him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
It's like in a miracle store, he still got to his feet and found the others.
The evil-roast Weathers were thought to continue to die and once again he was left with his own happiness.
It is clear that contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even those who were with him began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated
The Enon 200-year-old church has been celebrated in church today.
The church was dedicated on 4 October 1818, and the celebration of the holiday year was prepared for Sunday.
The parties began at Eno's church at 10 p.m. at a family fair, after which the shepherd's table had antimiae at Eno's church house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Eno's minister, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, says Iron Mountain.
Many have been touched by the fire of the church of the Flood, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Church of Eno is now in the fire of the oldest church of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu.
In 1770, the tree church of the climbing risk was completed.
In the morning, a discussion was held in the enchanting danger, where the church was silenced and remembered in the fire.
Pictures and videos: Median flashed into size in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-type syllable storm struck on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or median, is named Zorbax.
The Greek Air Science Institute has provided a red weather warning for the regions of Attika, Peloponnes, the islands of Joonia, Kycladis and Kreeta.
There are plenty of floods around Greece in images taken from the region.
In a video published on Twitter, you can see how between houses in the town of Kiato in the region of Korinthia suddenly appeared instead of the street because of the floods of the river.
The second video shows how the car has been transported into flood water.
In the southern part of Peloponnes, the wind caused intense shipping.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens instructs people on their Facebook site to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the monitoring of weather information and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or median, brings with it heavy rains and even floods.
According to CNN, one 2011 study, medicans occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on the road to September-October when the sea temperature is still high.
The current explosion left the floods behind in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
The concern in Greece has also caused refugee camps in islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrians and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The areas that have been destroyed by the earthquakes in Athens will also remain below the storm.
In Greece, the medician also fell in November last year.
We don't have to go to the sea right now, but we still have thousands of Finns on the Greek islands that threaten the Syrian storm.
The routes to the sea are cancelled and you should also be careful not to fly branches or other bulks in the storm.
These instructions have been distributed to the fair 3 500 in Greece for a holiday Finnish weekend through Suncomotors.
The instructions will be needed, because even the Zorbas storm, which is rising to fear readings, is predicted to hold Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Creta, the wind speed may rise in the cage up to 45 metres per second.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
All persons travelling to Greece via Sunnets and Tui, who have registered their telephone number, have been warned, according to tour operators, of hard wind by SMS.
But in the air, it's still sun and heat.
According to Inka Ikose, the solar system communication expert in Inka Ikosen, by the start of the Saturday night, has avoided the worst in resorts.
For example, flights have landed and reached according to normal schedule.
Of course, we'll be monitoring the situation all the time.
Security ahead, let's go.
I supported the media operator Antonia Schroderus tells us that their flights have also gone on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff on the subject.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the start on Saturday night.
The countries currently have the most popular Greek islands, or Rodos and Kreeta, with a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are staying in smaller places.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos may arrive on Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, Rodo had mocked the sun and the temperature pained to 27 degrees, according to the sun’s Ikonen.
Zorbaks has been estimated to become the next Turkish issue, although slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have, for example, reviewed the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tuilla, says Schroderus.
The Shirly Karvisa and Janni Huss have completely identical night costumes in the missionary, so they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finlandfina on Saturday in an open-air evening dress.
Hussi tells me she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great suit for this evening, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the runner Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself noticed similar costumes and was laughing at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanonom that he had come in urgent preparations, and he had to be put on a plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet driver in the missionary, and he talks about the forward stars that arrive.
Huss has a fresh move behind him, for he moved from the campus to the Lake Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
It is essential that a new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought about it.
Before he moved, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving.
When Stress went off, I got a flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior in the plane raised a lot of attention... to raise curiositys from pensioners.
In 2016, the runner and Miss Suomi Shirley Karvinen reported on the red carpet of Miss Finland with radio trains and Love Island pictures.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final, directly from Finnair's flight.
I made a dress and I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
I'm having a night change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen tells me that he's pulled out his makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also raised the attention of traveling passengers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw a mirror of people looking at me.
At least everyone thought I was having fun with my makeup.
Karvinen will fly to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marble.
Karvinen tells us that he enjoyed his nest as a plotter of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as being to stop it so far.
Karvinen tells me that he's been mopping on Friday's show for singles.
It's kind of real raw.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How am I supposed to wear overboard boots?
Three perfect examples
Classical clothes are clothes that work from the season to the other outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes they fit the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overburners that took off to hit the syllables of the season and winter have not gone away.
In accordance with their name, the boots on the knee are repeated in style from year to year.
They show boots to share user opinions, but a brave model should be tried, no - boldly.
It is true that the High Priests are suitable for any kind of housing.
It's about cockroach, lace, tacty or trico, boots' chimp leather or man-made leather.
Long boots look good in the holidays as well as in everydays.
Black excess boots are well suited for tender housing.
They correctly balance the femaleity of the pink, flowery pliser, and the tender, white needle.
Fresh but autumn-style scarring for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retrohekin housing consists of a long copper-rule sawmill, overboard boots, visible earrings and a wet bag.
Although there is a certain subtleity in the upper shelf boots, they are also perfectly suitable for relaxing the Arctic with the T-shirt, the long shorts and trendy slippers.
It's so easy, and it's still so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Cars of the VA operate in the role of the bus simulation, as next spring is intended to launch traffic on robot busses.
The project will develop and pilot robot vehicle transport throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
Try to figure out how robotic cars can do with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars run completely automatically in other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their environment with several sensors all the time and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether an obstacle to a vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowflakes is detected, reports the Sensible 4 CEO of Harri Santamala responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robot cars travel all autumn on three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, on Wednesdays 10-15 p.m. and on Thursdays 10-15 p.m.
The robotic cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The robotic car stops are identified by the stop markings.
You can find a more secure ride from the parking lot on the Otakare, number 1.

Police were monitoring hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
On Friday and Saturday, with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish riistakeskus, the police department carried out hunting surveillance in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's team members told social media on Saturday.
The main weight of surveillance was the lawfulness of hunting and the promise.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state countries.
In addition, the permit to hold hunting weapons and the permitted battery quantities of self-defence weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter who was not subject to the required hunting permit was present.
12 days of unauthorized fishing were assigned to the hunter.
In addition, the police had 133 drivers on the vehicle, and two of them were suspected of being a rat drinker.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, the police once.
To sum up, hunters are very good in keeping with the promise of hunting.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter said that I had been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits.
The police department in Eastern Finland will continue hunting surveillance in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The mobile will go to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees.
Minister of the Interior Kai Möknen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the choice of quota refugees coming to Finland.
In Finland, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been decided this year.
Elections are usually made a few times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first chooses people in particularly vulnerable situations.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly emergency situation in refugee camps, such as single - parent families, disabled people, and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for the group to come to Finland than there are in the quota, because practically some of them will not arrive for different reasons.
I am also on my way to non-governmental organisations operating at the border of the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Syleyman Soylu and Syria.
On the way, Ilkka Salmi, Head of the Ministry of Interior, is also involved.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1 050 years, but the government has not since been able to raise it.
The collection has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen into the blue front.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (medium) recently presented a quota increase gradually to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this period of government, the first of which the Minister of Internal Affairs is to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Home Ministers Petter Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move to their new jobs before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now, we're going to go get them... no longer know if they're crying or laughing.
Last Saturday, the Karjalainen announced a bill to amend the animal protection law.
The article found that the draft law was essentially prohibited as a production animal, pets or otherwise as a business activity in relation to the holding of all animals which were not specifically authorised by the Ministries Regulations.
Therefore, all other animals mentioned in the Regulation are originally prohibited.
If the draft law becomes legal, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western Democrats that the law specifically prohibits activities that jeopardise the safety of society or the good way of doing so.
Now we are starting to regulate the prohibition of all activities in which the law or regulation does not allow.
The amendment causes that nothing new can be tried in business activities, for example, and done nothing else before the law or regulation is adopted.
The government's activities in lawmaking have generally been weak.
If it is now to go to the road that, essentially, in Finland, everything is banned, which is not allowed, then no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't think the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this is not the case with democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think it will be able to accept the procedure of this kind, which is not permitted by law or by the regulation.
I hope you will find a sensible minister who will suspend the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tip: Syksyn's four trendiest skirts
This autumn's trend check comes in snake tissue.
It looks particularly good in skirts.
Connect the snake-shaped skirt to the upper parts, such as the pole or the normal t-shirt, to keep the outfit in style.
This autumn the silk appears in plenty, and especially the silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothes in the season.
Combine the fine silk skirt with a woman’s top or relaxed as a pair of needles.
You can play more bravely with a silk bite and throw on your feet, for example, flyers or autumn trend shoes, cowboy-boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's grey, brown or multi-sex, all square skirts are now part of each woman's black hair.
Combine freely different colors and play with the square joint with the upper part of the variety.
For example, the combination of a square joint and your balls is beautiful.
The insymmetric beads are a windfall from the summer spring, which can be taken with them in autumn.
The insymmetric pearl is at the same time womanish and playful and perfectly suited to the everydays as a feast.

Kimi Räikkönen put the blame on Mercedes' better than Ferrari.
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor in Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp time.
However, there is no reason to sink in a Panic, an experienced driver’s assessment.
They were just faster than us, but nothing huge is going on.
Our car was the best in time and time throughout the weekend for the time being, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven and with Sebastian Vettel, a friend of mine, clearly remaining at the Mercedes rate.
Ferrar was already in the previous race in Singapore.
The rag was asked why the same fall from the Mercedes ride was right.
They seem to go faster than us... so simple.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare taste for the future winter of Räikkösen for Sabuer.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Ferrari next season, was the seventh, and the last time-breaking episode was also up by Marcus Ericsson.
The tenth departure point for the Swedish student is best for over three years.
And even though five drivers left behind in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging the Räikkös for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early days, the step forward has been a big one.
Next year, there's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius strangled Erkan Teper: “Robbe is back -
Robert Helenius's and Erka Teper's match at Stuttgart's night moved forward on a level mark.
The Germans were more a beginner in the ring, but they didn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius, who is more far-reaching, controlled the match with his hard series, who found it well.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked right into Teper on his left.
The hit was so hard that the convent in front of the household didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was very moderate.
At the meeting, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponents created by the public.
Then he changed for a moment to speak in Finnish.
Thank you all for your viewers and Finnish incentives.
We took the belt with us today.
Helena was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
There might be a chance of getting into the World Cup, Helenius commented on the newspaper before the fight.
Instead, he could have decided the whole boxing career.
Of course it's been on my mind.
This isn't going to be any younger, but he's 34 years old, Helenius admitted before he met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesia disaster can be multiplied
According to The Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Severe conditions
Pelaters are searching for the remaining ones and also the dead from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please visit the port city and its neighboring municipality in Donggala.
To date, all victims are Palus, there is no clarity about the situation in Dongala.
Hundreds of people are lost and about 540 are injured.
There are still people in the torn buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the hotel Palu, named Roa Roa, has failed.
The Saviors say that they hear the screams of people who have fallen from the ruins, but the lack of the grubbing-up has delayed the beginning of their rescue work.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has assigned the army to rescue and grubbing-up.
There is a need for military and equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections in the disaster area are in many places.
Fuel reserves are also building up.
Miss Finland -phinist's vague answer and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäs in Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview tour, a question was put to every missionary.
The finalists asked me a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, the unpleasant answer was given to the audience present at the time of the sweets, but the good-looking laughs.
The question referred to Anttikoske had come through Facebook.
The user, Pirkko-El, wanted to know what was the latest book that the missionary has read.
Antikoski thought about his answer to the good news before he began the suspicions.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-El.
The last book I've ever read, Anttikoski said, thinking.
In the audience, the break-up took place at the time of the laughter, until Anttiikoski continued his reply:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttiikoski got the public with the fresh applause made by the laughter.
In the past, Anttikoski, a missionary, raised attention, for he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The year 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 2 p.m. when the crown is abandoned last year by Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple-head cake takes the tongue

Ruka is organising an international crime literature event in January
Kuusamo Ruka will be organized for the first time in January as an international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programming numbers, as well as jazz music.
The Swedish writer Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund, who is behind the name of the Swedish writer Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, are among other things to be seen as guests of the festival’s literature.
In addition to Swedish names, writers are also visited from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event represent Max Seeck.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, dark season, and Kuusamo’s unique environment provide a framework for a unique written experience.
Statussymbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or an admirer?
The researchers of the University of Sydney who analysed the matter have outlined two slightly different aspects of the ‘coolity’ type: generally attractive cololiity and, in that respect, the opposite dissident-coolity.
In fact, according to the description of the researchers, people at Cooles had many aspects that were considered socially desirable: they were outwardally oriented, friendly, friendly, and qualified.
For dissidents, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion and pain.
They were thirsty for experience and only kept a little out-of-the-spot evaluation.
Both types shared good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not longer on the cool: high status in teen-age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how the study of the United States of America published in the Child Development magazine 2014.
Young people who used to date early, to sit down, applied for fine - looking carrots and seek the favor of others, had an increased risk of using drugs and crimes when they were young adults.
In their relationships, they were less able to cope than at one time with their most elusive age mates.
The locks, the sign bags, or the bells that send high status don't make people cool, or even genuinely attractive associations.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their normal market shirt than with clothing - despite the fact that most of them chose one sign in the circumstances of their visit.
If you're on the Greek holiday island, be careful!
There's an attack on the storm. The weather's coming out of the red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, as much water can be rained as in Finland during the average period of six months.
The Zorbas storm will strike Greece during the weekend.
Book for it if you are in the Peloponnes, the island of Joonia, Kyklada or Creeta.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Athenian Embassy reports it on its Facebook site.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has provided a red weather warning for the regions.
There is also a weather service in Foreca's blog about the approaching storm.
According to it, the hardest hips of the storm are up to 45 metres in seconds.
Due to the comparison, Finland’s early week piessyt Kusma storm blew up at its hardest fairs in 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, the greatest concern of the Zorbas storm, however, is not the wind, but the rough rains.
The weekend in South Greece can come over 300 millimetres of water.
It corresponds to about half of the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video about the development of storms on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods earlier this week to Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the Love Island Anku, the man who died?
Plays with confusing Youtube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island series, the beautiful Anku, which has been killed by several men, is also found in strange videos of Youtube published in 2010.
In video, Anku advises askartels to prepare, among other things, the old economic paper roll in the ink industry.
The duck also shows her sympathetic style how tights can be in an askarre with a silk to which the right thumbs grow.
Now, they're gonna make Easter dishes grow, but they're gonna do it in a bit of a surprise, Anku's tipping and presenting the sawdust, stockings, and the beard seeds he's doing.
You can watch the videos from under or from Anku Youtube channel here.
Valtter Bottos was shaking and shattering adrenaline in Sotsh, is he going to be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtter Bottas was a little bit more than ten minutes after the Russian gp roasting season when he was in front of the media.
The great tour left Lewis Hamilton, one of Mercedes, and it was definitely an important criticism of the Finnish age that was collected this season.
It's a nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottos figured it out.
I've only been on the stake this year in Austria (in the middle), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I've had good tours again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sosh track, so we're in a particularly big role to play.
And, of course, Bottos was able to respond to the long-term question whether he would win tomorrow or whether he would be in the front of the World Cup approaching Hamilton's Jeestration.
My starting point is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the stake, there can be no other goal, Bottos.
But as a stable, we'll fight for both of them.
Lewis' leadership in Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and I'm getting a very big divorce, so it's gotta keep in mind.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy after the ride, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed it.
Lewis had a intention to win Valtter, but he couldn't do it in the back of his head.
The coach knows he's gonna have to rip everything out of his mind to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline would burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To ask if the stable Bottaks and Hamilton were to drive well, Wolff said so.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning and see how the race starts.
The kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen reached the race at the Finnish Championship
The SSM series for racing was rarely terminated.
I don't think the brothers have ever reached out to be Finnish masters at the same time.
Now it was done by the Tullo-Salo finalist Eerik and Henrik Peternen, who won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
The Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career, while the third place in the final race was sealed by the SM4 class of the Finnish Championships.
The successful Kinnunen and card reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku semi-competition because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the twin had to give a balance when some of the extra lights failed the second special test.
There was a bit of shock for the third guy.
In such a situation, it's not a good idea to be hovered.
Saturday was only the second time that Jussi Tepo was on the show, Kinnunen told me.
Syria demands the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without any conditions.
Mulelam said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is nearing him.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the war that continued for seven years.
Over 360 000 people have died in war.
On Friday, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel told us in Germany that in October there will be a meeting in Syria to be attended by the French, Russian and Turkish Presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were watching the Supreme Court on TV.
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasay Ford, who was accused of harassment, received an extraordinary number of people at the edge of the tracks.
In the United States, at least 20 million people received the highest court judge's appointment on Thursday by their televisions.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasay Ford of California, accused of harassment, were telling his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the hearings were followed by six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In order to increase their online consultation, millions more were followed.
The NBC reported that the live Masters were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that they had made their annual record with 8.2 million live shipments.
The CNN figure rises to over 10 million, according to which you have followed the shipment via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million to start.
Digital launches are owned by channels, TV coverage is derived from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are, in any case, dizziness.
It's rare to reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only receive sports matches and the great Oscar and Grammy galleries in the entertainment world, as well as extraordinary political events such as the President's speeches and the presidential protests in 2016.
The most viewed annual program in the United States, the NFL final match in the American football league, is certainly on the way to Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel along the trails.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was seen by Nielsen by nearly 48 million people and 30 million officials.
It's a top priority.
The title of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, as the authorities are living.
Trump was already appointed to a new judge when Antonon Scania died from early 2016 and the Republicans managed to stop President Barack Obama from calling him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was, on several issues, the so-called electoral language, which the voice of which was able to rule on the position of the ninth court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and sex minorities' rights and, for example, in 2015, he voted for the same sex to become married throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his hens.
The highest court in his choice may be to lock down the right to a conservative force for decades.
Children have the right to be informed of their parents
Only parents under 10 years of age can see health data from their children from Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
At first, the situation in Kanta was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of young people.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for people under 10 years of age.
Since then, practice has been promised to be corrected, but repair has taken an amazing long time.
Now the repair is on the promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an outright thing.
After that, the understanding of the painting is about the button's printing: when the pipe is closed, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his parents his knowledge if he has a bank code or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds are?
Your ID's paid, and 10-year-olds don't even get credit.
Thus, no one in the fourth grade can actually see data in practice except by asking them to be printed.
It's not as much about parents' rights as children's rights.
It is extremely important for a child to have parents involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations where all matters are not free to speak.
They often involve sexual health, which is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the U.S., the FBI started the messing up of Kavanaugh's harassment charges.
According to US media, at least two women's harassment charges are settled by the FBI.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs.
Kavanaugh has challenged the accusations concerning the alleged sexual harassment of his studies.
The U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Legal Committee.
It's not gonna take a week to find out.
According to Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation of a limited investigation, and it's not necessarily public.
He threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaan.
The hit-and-run guy continued pulsing in the chamber.
The police are telling me that he's put a man in prison to rape a police officer.
The police had to target the suspect's assault threat on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The authorities will inform us of a case that began when a fair 30-year-old man was in a rough fight at the central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer within the nutrition shop.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighters attacked another man by pouring him on the ground.
When the third party tried, he still hit him.
The triangular struggle led to a call from the police.
The patrol picked up the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police tell us.
The suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police are telling me that he's been sent to prison for a while, and that he's been raped.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition from the official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start their work in Sulawes, Indonesia, – “The water in Puhdas is the most urgent thing.
The UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, the Finnish Head of Information of Unicef.
Local authorities lead rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicefi always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people from ruins, both survivors and dead.
Please in the city of Sulawes rescue measures are underway, but in the region of Dongala, the situation is a little more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Grants are difficult because the roads are also different, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is huge.
When the survivors have been found, they need protection, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time, people are most often able to provide water cleaning tablets, which are also stored in Unicef.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency water is transported first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children have to get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and combining families is one part of the Unicef task field.
Food aid is being organised again, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, among other things, Unicef has already started a cash collection to help the victims of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami.
The billionaire Elon Musk will end the Tesla Government as Chairman of the Tesla Government - the 20 million dollars fines on twiite
Elon Musk, founder of space-based and electric cars companies, avoids fraud charges by contract with the US Securities Commission.
A billionaire Elon Musk quit his mission as Chairman of the Tesla Government and agrees to the $20 million fines.
The Musk will be removed from the task as part of an agreement that he concluded with the US Securities Markets Supervisory Authority.
By applying Musk to avoid fraud.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muski for the fraud of securities due to his twiites sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to the rapid rise of the company's stock exchange.
According to the agreement, Musk must not act as Chairman of the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new non-independent member of its government and take the lead in two independent directors:
Tesla must also set up a Committee to monitor Musk's communication.
The Musk may still continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski’s personal $20 million fines, Tesla will also have to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
The Twiits misguided investors
According to the SEC, Muski's twiits were misleading investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have guaranteed financing to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's twists, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at $420.
The Tesla stock exchange rate rose by more than 10 per cent a day, but later decreased.
According to the SEC, Muski's claims had no basis at all.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his alleged funding.
Nor had he discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with other management groups or the company’s government.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14% when the security officer SEC reported fraud.
A new agreement is expected to reconfirmed the company's course.
The final judgment is not a reason.
Of course, the clocks of the courthouse don't ring when the wisers don't move.
It's a technical error.
The watch on the tower of the Helsinki Court of Justice has stopped.
The wisers will show you at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a middle - story horror movie: even if the church's crypt is a manna and the humidifiers would fight for themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it has been broken.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some part has broken and is expected to be a new part, says the Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Twitter account has already been mentioned.
The account mentions that the final judgment has no reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen tells me that the bells in the church don't ring for a mistake.
