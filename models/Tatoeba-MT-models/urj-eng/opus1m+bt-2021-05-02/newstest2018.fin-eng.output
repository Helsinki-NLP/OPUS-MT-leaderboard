She wanted to correct her sex, diagnosed, and now she's doing art on the subject, and the person should have the right to his own body.
Ten patient reports are coming from the ceiling of the project room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell us a multi-annual story about how external people have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
He's the one who decided who he is.
\"I wanted to inform a person about my medical history so that the violence of the process would be visible,\" Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the process of gender correction.
It is often a period of years of study involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start by sending a close-side identity disorder: diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the Estrogen he had ordered online and was in his own repair process in a very long time anyway.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, that is the law to strengthen the gender of the transceiver (563/2002) to oblige trans-national people to sterilization in order, for example, to obtain the right sex at the centre of population register and passports.
At present, each gender correction requires psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of incapacity for reproduction.
People have the right to decide on their own bodies.
\"This is an unacceptable situation and an insult to human rights,\" says Auer.
The reform of the Translain has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight legislative comments and the European Court of Human Rights is a preliminary decision which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right of self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the leadership of Mr Susanne Huovinen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections and the Privileges rose to the government.
Now we're stuck in the law again.
This is a matter of internal policy which is not even related to this law.
“The Board does not want to raise it on the table, because there are differences within the government to change the law,” says Frank Johansson, CEO of Amnessty’s Finnish department.
Two large installations control the front of the exhibition space.
Another of these is the packaging and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the psychological interpretation of the University Hospital Transpol in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on these grounds, which should be defined for the treatment and assistance of Auer's right.
The consciousness of the researchable reality appears to be exposed to snoring.
The researcher’s perception of himself appears to be borderlined and unstable features of personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these pictures.
\"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness,\" Auer says.
Even more shock was there when Auer was not given gender correction therapy.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpolian waiting door to spread the television.
Later on, that television was born in a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflelled his experience of power and use.
“It’s crazy that any person defined as a woman in birth can grow their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove the breasts,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you try to be nothing but the number of sex you have established in birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality.
The gender correction process is more severe for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
There are dozens of people who need to justify their existence and right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help will be denied treatment, calling on them not to have enough resources, ” Auer says.
Many of those who have applied for the process are behind psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
In these cases, the healthcare professional may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
“To prevent treatment and assistance can feed a person even worse than it was before the beginning of the process, ” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication Auer writes: “I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is what it is usually difficult for people to melt.
Depression has been treated with medicinal products and when Auer started using hormones, feeling better.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teenager.
Why the wide jaw did not seem appropriate to its own body, and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The main thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic necessity.
“It’s time to justify it by speaking, dressing, using the sound, and moving, ” he says.
Today Auer is already experiencing his coming sight, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, close comments could have hurt a lot.
Most of the time it hurts when people around you are mischief.
They should know, and they know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to contain it, he will continue.
But not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body irritability, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long-term research process, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of its own sex.
“There is no medical basis for these studies, ” says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-age applicant submits a written application for a new identification number stating that he is experiencing another sex.
After a period of six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm its application in writing and the Ministry shall provide the applicant with a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required for Finland and the Auer exhibition is attached to this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Protection Organization provided a travel warning to Missour
The NAACP national travel warning for African-American civil rights has been issued by the NACP, which is the reason for the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that have taken place there.
‘The travel notice of the NACP Mission will enter into force on 28 August 2017, calling for African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to respect extreme caution when travelling to a state which has recently experienced a number of questionable racial events, says the organization’s press release.
According to the NACP, these issues led to a travel warning.
People's civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and assaulted or killed, Rod Chapel, President of the NACP Mission, said to Kansas City Star.
\"We have never heard of one of the cases in one short time.
The travel notice for Mission is the first warning of the U.S. State.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racist comments against African American students at the University of Mission and the death of the 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tensse.
Sanders died in question earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missour's police arrested him even though he wasn't accused of a crime.
The travel information also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Mission, according to which the police would stop the black driver by 75% more likely than white.
“The purpose of the travel information is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what can happen in the missour, Chapel says.
For example, people must prepare themselves to include money to pay guarantees or to tell relatives that they intend to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, 100 of the storm crimes were recorded in Mission in 2015, i.e. the sixth most of the states in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missour, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the issue of discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU, which guarantees civil rights rights, recently provided travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that force the police to arrest people from immigration violations.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes travel warnings and concerns other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Top: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on a supplementary pension from the CEO
Mr Mika Lintila (medium.) has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension paid by the CEO of the airline, Pega Varamon, to be paid by Yle.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the government's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130,000 received by Varamon was raised this week when Helsinki’s Word was news of the award development of stock exchange managers.
The Finnish Picture magazine news about Vauramon’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair told me he'd give up additional pensions in 2013.
The state has directed that no supplementary pension is used for reward.
The state owns over half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the last year's corporate governance policy decision.
The sanctions were about to come up with a lot of talk.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way to a cold warm.
In the context of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to make a great deal of progress.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic patents that were signed last week by the U.S. Congress, and Trump, on Wednesday, were responded with a strong reaction in Russia.
The most serious answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, which states that the law on sanctions signed by Trump means “a full-scale commercial war”.
Even if the Russian reactions were to be applied only as cuts and overruns of political rhetoric, it is the fact that the tightening between the US and Russia after the short months of Trump's election.
In the United States, it was not easy to go through the Penal Code for Russia, Iran and North Korea.
However, the Congress adopted the law with considerable agreement, but the adoption of the law to the President was reported to be much more difficult.
In fact, Trump criticises the fact that he has recently signed the law, which means he's not guilty.
President Trump's impurity must have been a reason, in particular, for Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting its own powers must have been offensive.
As is well known, investigations are being carried out in the United States on the possibility of Russia's involvement in the presidential elections as well as on the Russian associations of the Trump campaign.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short period of coercion.
Once the White House staff has changed their focus and various scandalous translations have appeared almost to be updated, it seems more and more clearly that foreign policy does not lead to the President in the United States, but despite the President.
There is no hope for such a situation.
If the Russian relationship is a puzzle in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic patents, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is exacerbating relations.
The EU has clearly held forward the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
Even though the Union has so far remained united in its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
A country such as Russia, such as Finland, which trades a lot, has been a real issue.
The effects of the U.S. fresh sanctions are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make the operation of many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, for example, effects may be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has resulted in the exclusion from sanctions, for example, of an important liquid natural gas to the US economy.
Trade patents are a way of showing evil in world politics.
However, economic patents must be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more damaging than they are beneficial.
Isn't nothing holy anymore?
The White House of Trump now has the most targeted statue of Freedom
The lack of patients is a sure sign of change in power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, lost it to the statue of Saddam Husse in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main subjects of Trump's administration, knew well what was being done in an inconvenient debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta, who was subject to Miller's attack in the vocabulary on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly appreciate the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked the vast herds of cruise organisers and the immeasurable characters of freedom.
His attack was aimed at the importance of the statue, and in particular that in 1903 the statue was added to the poem of Emma Lazarus – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller wrote Acosta: “I don’t want to go into more detail in history, but the statue of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original race of Freedom.
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it's not just history, as he himself said.
The essentials are the words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the state calls not only immigrants, but also \"the one of the poorest: \"You know, your boss, / Your hudled massages yearning to breathe free, / The time spent meeting of your teaming shere-
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller didn't practice literature criticism, and he made it clear that \"the poorest ones of all, are not welcome to Trump's United States.
It is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the Rule of Freedom.
Lazarus’ friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his statue’s feet; they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of Patsa was to reveal the links between French and American republicalism with a classic symbol of freedom by a womanly fertilisation.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, a woman’s character is no longer an abstract, but it has a voice.
And it will give itself a new name: the deported mother.
The inclusion of Runo in the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a guide that can now be considered as some kind of prediction of Trump – claimed in 2010, that the statue of Freedom is not called to anyone, but that it is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, who will bring the United States to the blind to cover the world: “Lady Liberty is coming up.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The play doesn't show us the way to the United States.
Well, it's rare, Limbaugh was partially right.
The importance of the patent depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and the exhausted, but the hopes of immigrants on board the ship after a long and challenging journey.
He saw its protection and the perspective of people seeking better life.
His Son of Freedom will comfort you by giving hope and welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their mouths do not show the way, but the flames of anger, their only source of power.
General Sports MM Competitions 2017: Neil Black boasts the UK National Team Scottish members
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two scotchs came to the UK National Team
Neil Black, CEO of the British League of Sports, says that 16 scotch members in the World Championships are – a significant confirmation -
A record of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Cup competitions in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland, from which the British general sports must learn.
“This is welcome and we continue to study it for so long that we understand what it is all about,” Black says.
“I focused on the representatives of the Scotland Sports Institute, and they thought it was linked to the work of the Institute.
The Scottish General Sports Association believes that it is linked to the Union's activities,
And the British General Sports Association believes that it is behind them.
And the usual streetr thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, it is something quite amazing, which is why it is,
Many Scottish athletes compete in London seriously on medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 meters of running.
He's just a little modest.
His speech was incredible, Black says.
“The crowds left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
The words of Eilith had a real feeling and passion for sport.
Eilith Doyle is a shopping player at the National Championships at 400 meters of the suburbs, and these are his fifth World Championship, and he thinks it's unbelievably unbelievably... that the county team has 16 scotch.
The previous record was from seven years in 1983 and 2015.
During the year, the average traveler Laura Muir has run five British and two European record.
He competes in London at 500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare is running in London at 1,500 meters. It is also worth keeping an eye on: a man has an excellent season, which includes victory in the UK World Cups and the Anniversary Games Competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only scotch in the country team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the Earth team says he's very proud of the fact that there are so many scotchs, some of which actually compete in final places and medals.
\"It is a great honour to be a captain, but it is even more specific because the members of the national team voted for the captain,\" Doyle says.
Of course, I'm very proud of all the scotch that got into the country team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are part of the prized athletes who compete for the prizers.
Captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we got home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the household and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there, and I know that the climate is going to be amazing.
Prevention of critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you do not stand criticalness
Our country's father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for every possible domestic policy, always in his political principles.
I'm sure the crisis was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
“If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and silent as sheep to be slaughtered, ” Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. League of Civil Liberties challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff regarded the challenge as unfounded, and his attitude was also minor online.
- What difference does it make? This is just Facebook, a lot of comments.
But it's important,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor in the state of democracy.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to hot stuff.
He has led the state firmly and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main contact channel for his constituents and published a picture of his bickered head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users on the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains on tax stocks.
Mr. Hogan's informant, Amelia Chase, defended the governor in his interview with Washington Post, and he said that it was just a matter of modulating comments.
However, it is too easy to mark commentators as trolls, smugglers or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users on Hogan's Facebook site.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind, and proper.
In his comments, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland, Bowie, was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
“I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand for hate crimes and other recent news, ” he wrote Washington Post’s comments.
\"And I cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered as an organised force and are sidelined as a large group of people who are concerned.
The governor's staff called comments, \"centre attack,\" someone else could call them \"to promote important things\".
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing critical comment.
In the past, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical headlines, or to arrest and silence protesters.
However, it is actually the same thing, but it is now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who has been accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump's blocking Twitter users have sued him.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria's judge, James C. Cacheris, the government of Loudoun County, violated the first increase in the U.S. Constitution by blocking the voter's Facebook.
And the U.S. League of Civil Rights discussed the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At Washington’s time, affordable postal charges had similar effects on the Internet today.
The number of newspapers was fourfolded from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers were deflecting Washington.
Even then, there were trolls.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers where they called Washington's decisions.
In the President's office, appeals were criticised by Jay's agreement, namely the United States-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of the George Washington Network Project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
A real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about twenty places, and also online notifications from two, three.
Most of them have come from South and Varsinais Finland, but then they are individual from Haapaved and Wallájo, a specialist scientist from Marja Isamursu Evira.
The greens are dead to a tricomone.
It's a scientificly known as Trichomonas gallinae in the early life.
It has previously been known to strike on the doves, and especially on the top of them.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also found to be pyopulins.
In 2009, he was very good at falling.
At that time, the tricomosis caused a major collapse in Finland in the green paper, and after which the stock has been on its way to recovery.
There have been sick green-peops, but at least not yet in the big scale, the University of Helsinki’s Scientific Center (Luomus) museum master Juha Honkala says.
It is hoped that the previous epidemic of the green turtles will be renewed again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to end the summer food of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty wishes to benefit from the home field promotion at the Renaissance Club
The former European 1st player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field promotion for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises 25.
Last year, Northern Ireland’s Rafferty led a tournament held next door in the Archerfield Links field before the last round but eventually disappeared to Paul Eales. Rafferty has liked a new place and operates as the ambassador for the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will allow it to be filled with glory,” says Rafferty.
They see the field at their best, and it's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a very excited ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his time-outs here.
The tournament is a great performance show for this field.
For the first time, England's Eagles defends the championship, even though he has won the European tour and the European challenger tour on his 32-year career.
\"This feels like a very special occasion,\" says the player in Southport.
- I couldn't defend Extremadura Open's victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time, and we'll always remember...
Gary Orr is returning to the real deal on his own soil, and he went to the tour once he was 50 years old this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland then in 2013 Aberdeen Ascend Management Scottish Open tournament.
“Toying in the region is always more and more relevant, ” says Orr, Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm pleased to have a party so far.
The triangle will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNultyn.
The tournament will take part in six shots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if there is only a driver, and 10 pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All income is donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Organisation.
The weather covered the potential internal air problems of the coarm
At the cabin, at least no internal air problems have been found in Porin's private message company building, which was reported on Thursday.
Internal air studies will continue.
The studies began when a man who stopped his emergency service for health reasons thought he had weakened his health due to a bad inner air of karm.
According to Lieutenant General Mika Holma, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other backups.
It turned out that this was an individual illness, and there have been no health problems for other servants in that unit.
Each declaration is taken seriously and we wanted to find out in depth about this.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problems,\" Holma says.
The Privacy Notice states that due to the number of arrivals in July, goods must have been transferred to the cages and therefore dust could have increased at an instant.
That's why the air may have seemed to be intrusive, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s golden country
Bardina Degei doesn't use her cooking.
He only rarely wears a cat.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in the Indonesian restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batatin – locally – directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the cataract burned to the car is eaten with the bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dege's home. He sits on a ancient painting, where he usually treats his day-to-day as well as his laundry in the same water that was applied for near the swamp.
The office will be delivered by a bucket in the lost room.
Degei is one of the four wives of his youngest husband, and he has not been assigned fields to be treated.
Multi-maritality is common here.
Later work can be dangerous: the majority of the village's men are unemployed, and many drinks are to be taken into account by soldiers.
\"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,\" Degei says.
This is a rare curvature in the upper parts of the Arctic Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was linked to Indonesia in 1969. The accession was preceded by a controversial referendum, where 1 026 village prices were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement that opposed the Dutch authorities quickly turned its anger into the Jakarta Government, which keeps the region under its strict control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from getting there.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The Enariotal is remote, and the trip begins on a half-hour flight from the province capital to Jayapura to Nabira and continues on a five-hour drive trip to the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19 000 inhabitants, there are wood houses surrounded by bamoabuas, with arable rust dyed to be bells.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have happened.
\"We didn't have such clothes,\" Degei says. He means colored, hand-to-mouthed, dark skirt and bright color to the sweater.
Until then, all we had was the leaves of our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold.
Paniia is about New Jersey's upper area with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grassberg, the world's largest and most productive gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, which has its seat in Phoenix United States.
In 2015, the mine produced a $1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have $78 billion of timber reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, for they mean a strong army of Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military staff and military local units between 1998 and 2004.
This source of income is threatened by greater self-determination than what is required of him, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, after 1969, the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 clergymen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths on the top of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were measured by genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3 900 people in the region in peaceful demonstrations.
In the report by the British Archbishop of Archbishop We Will Lose Everyting in 2016, there are reports of the cruelties of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture, rapes and electric attacks, particularly popular means – and unscrupulous attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
\"The calculation of the number of victims is difficult because of the fact that cases are weekly, says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been blackmailed when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provinces, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing, while the Indonesian population from the islands of Jaavan, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes is changing to the region in the hope of a better living.
The Jaavai Warung dishes sell roasted chicken and gado-gado-gado in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
“Males have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market worse than locals, ” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the province capital after work.
The local women lost their clients.
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo – Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to intervene in the injustices and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papa is composed of 29 regions, and this former hippo won the vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential city.
But only a little has changed to Papua, and the locals feel disappointed.
“Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected that he would meet our wishes and restore justice,” says You.
Pania was found on some kind of wave base only two months after Jokowin's early retirement.
The eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the feast at Enarotal on 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles.
The scared kids told the soldiers that they should use the lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the drunk soldiers took the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the warriors shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yemomio, tended to a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the election board of the State located near the site of the event was set on fire, and the next day started to happen.
About a thousand parrots – young men and women and children – gathered in the football field before the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They had the hunting moves for the holidays, and they began to play the traditional waita dance of Papua Mee Pago, where they danced around and traced bird song.
Some protestors began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere was hot, soldiers received orders from the internal radio system: “If more than three times the crowds are to resist, shoot them to death,” the information is based on an official document of the TIME magazine that has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, Kego Koto’s resident manager, emphatically disengaged the situation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot on the left hand side, ” he told the TIME magazine about his wooden house painted in bright color.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
\"A number of shots were shot in the emergency room...
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him, and I made sure he did, ” told Yohanes TIME, a sad magazine, and, like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him...
Captain Yotje Mende of Papua told the journalists that the police were just protecting the police station because it was under attack.
\"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,\" said Pudjo Sulistiyao, a police informant in Papua, in 2015.
It's about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The information about the deaths came back to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi held an emotional speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to touch the violence in Papua.
\"I want the case to be examined immediately so that no such thing will ever happen again...
In October 2016, Minister for Security Wiranto said that he would launch human rights violations reports outside the legal system.
But he started to cancel his speech right away.
“A long time ago, a large part of the violations took place,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate crimes, but it requires certain processes, he said.
In an interview at the TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind.
It's all settled in court, he told me.
The UN is accused of Wiranto crimes against humanity: Crimes relate to more than a thousand deaths in the Eastern Timor vertical independence vote in 1999, Wiranto said to the TIME magazine that 11 cases have already been dealt with in relation to the human rights violations of Papua, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania are deeply unbelief about the arguments.
“I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” says Yohanes.
I'm already tired of this.
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
Yes, I'm afraid, he says.
I'm afraid the army's gonna arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panicists are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four victims.
The soldiers are looking for me after they bury the victims, he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot village people in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One died, and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the building company, which began when the manager refused to take the lost man to the hospital, and there were children among the injured.
The man who needed hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been in possession of water while fishing in a nearby river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers showed their mind in the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the police who answered the warning plates.
However, according to locals, the Indonesian paramilitary police unit opened fire per crowd, when one village citizen was killed.
We're terrified of revenge, says 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to the hospital.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be taken to the responsibility of the police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile police unit from the area.
Paniia has always been a problem point for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Mon, Dani and Damal tribes that live in Papua's wheat in the middle plains.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the populace's rights by random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian military soldiers.
Part of OPM's leaders is Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by holding up their rebellion and by arbitraryly imprisoning thousands of people in Pania, in the name of safeguarding national sovereignty.
Some arrests will never come back.
Among the Papuars, Pani is known as “sudden, forgotten place,”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
Only a small amount of rice is sold in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly Batats and some fruit and foliage.
Viljely is the work of women, and one woman can be responsible for four or five batats.
Most of the rain is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten Batate only costs 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
As a result of the time, differences in the income of local and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to the Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go better for trained and more wealthy migrants.
Only a few papuals have sufficient capital and know how to run their own business in a competitive way.
“The young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money here,” says John Gobai, President of the Pania tribe council.
The syllable Papau will remain on the world with little attention.
In addition, restrictions on international news remain stringent.
In the past year, French suppliers Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare description permit.
According to Phelim Kinen, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not held his electoral promises; he has not increased transparency and did not promote development by removing restrictions on news.
“Indonesia’s most relaxing East Provinces from Papua and West Papu have new risks: refusal of visa and access to the black list,” said Kine in her opinion.
The absence of a press freedom of action means that the Government of Indonesia will only be under pressure by the neighbouring neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread violations of Papua, including the Pania shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the free movement of Papua.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, challenged the accusations and told the journalists in Jakarta, that \"Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so the cover of human rights violations would be difficult to cover.
Locals want foreign government to be lacking.
When the official Dutch delegation led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Barari visited Jayapura 4.5.2017, the locals broke silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports the anonymous permanent source of the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections in 2019, but the parrots say that it is unlikely that they will no longer vote on Jokowi.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Pania shooting scene,” says Gobai, President of the National Council.
He wants Jokowin to know about the situation of the Palestinians: they live under the authority of the greedy and unforeseeable army in lack and poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Pianites, like the other clergymen, consider the voices they have given to Jokow as a debt to pay back.
They don't want money, they just want justice, he says.
Despite threats and fear, the families of the victims of Pania’s shooting had once more demonstrated their opposition in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims of the police station and the military office in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
\"My family member was killed,\" says Yacobus.
- What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora is barking at Robert Helena's replay: \"And even her own fans don't want to see...
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora of the heavy boxers were supposed to be in Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
However, the deal was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora is squealing in a recent interview with IFL TV on the cause of the re-suspension to the full Helenius shoulders.
My business in Finland was floped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was for my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don't want to see her fight because she sucks, Chisora is bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the fight with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the renewal went quiet, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanonom in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
It's been a long time since the deal, and there's nothing new about it.
However, the retreat is no longer bad for Chisora.
The deal would probably have to be reversed if Chisora had been ill.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up with a lot of pain.
The tyrant was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The British says he's in some 45 percent condition right now.
He's not interested in a resuscitation with Helenius at all, but Dillian Whyte is on the target.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whyte in December.
You've come to power once again at the Rach cloudmaker in Dubai.
The flames took over the world’s highest living building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from a 37 - foot - high 79 - floor building.
This was already another fire within two years in a building called Torch.
The building was empty and no one was known to have been injured, and for the reason of the fire there was no idea immediately after the event.
“We were asleep and woke up in the voice of the fire alarm and in the screams of the people.
We ran the stairs down from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, the resident named George told Reuters.
According to the security authorities in Dubai, the fire was set off at four o'clock in the morning and left to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case can raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the board of the Torch building carried out a study which showed that the most damaged albums used for public networking and isolation were the most affected.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the Grenfeld Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take on board prohibited articles, exposes surveying
The survey on air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited articles knowingly or without knowingly past the inspection points of the U.S. Road Safety Agency (TSA). At least six per cent of passengers were bovine or other steel-based objects that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said that they had only arrived afterwards to know that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives in a mistake.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire, and it was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, which also reveals that young passengers are more likely to threaten the rules.
In the TSA rules, 19.7 per cent of passengers who were aware of the breaches were representatives of the Y-sukupoke and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-sukupole.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids into the plane.
More than three per cent admitted to the aircraft that was equipped with steel. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had taken banned drugs to the aircraft knowingly.
The survey involved passengers from across the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the smuggling goods had accidentally been carried out by accident, and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also more likely to pass security checks – consciously or knowingly.
However, as the company that did the survey states, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what fluids you can take to the plane and how much.
It is no surprise, then, that most of the TSA seized are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that books should not be taken to the plane.
You can take the nets to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environment Agency, passed his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions
The day after the 15 states had challenged the law of Scott Pruitit, Director of the EPA, of the U.S. Environment Agency, the Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke-related emissions during the Obama administrative period.
According to the rapporteur, the change shows that the Agency that he has led takes more account of past administrations in the needs of environmental decision-makers in the States.
Pruitt did not mention the action against which his earlier decision had been brought before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Member States should start to comply with the 2015 ground ozone requirement as from 1.10.
In June, the Pruitt announced that he would move the decisions forward by one year in order to have more time for his agency to study the plan, as the Agency does not wish to intervene in local decision-making or to harm economic growth.
Pruitt was a public prosecutor in the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA.
After coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change of mind in the middle of the week is the latest setback for the Pruitt plan to alleviate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that, in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama Management Decision on oil and gas companies, the Director of the EPA, imposed on companies to monitor and reduce methane years.
In its opinion on Wednesday evening, Mr Pruitt claimed that only the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable will be strengthened.
“In previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then expected the activist groups and others to challenge the court in which the timetables were to be reached,” Pruitt said, and he applied for the law of the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous action.
“We do not believe in regulation through trial and we take time to act seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and on the powers that we are willing to do.
However, it was found in the EPA opinion that it could continue to use its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers, in order to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
The Republicans in Congress are driving a wider change of ozone regulations.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
This week, the universal prosecutor Eric Schneiderman of the state of New York, who has sued the court of state, told us that the group intends to continue pressure.
“The change in the minds of the EPA as a result of our complaints is a significant victory for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of cigarettes in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the surface is generated when emissions of cars, power plants, oil processing plants and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This may cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups of people, which are also involved in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promotionists and environmentalists were happy with the unexpected change in the direction of Pruitt.
“It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the guy responsible for our breath used a healthy sense of mind, ” says Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We have to fight against the regime of Trump, as its ideological objective is to act under the conditions of the polluters and other groups of their own interests.
The supercar manufacturer's coming to the street masturbate event with Ferrari's style.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while seeking to hold onto its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrar style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about planning at the information conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, automated News news.
All cases of the same virus type in East Savo
The coastal carcase infection is the same as the previous cases in East Savo, which informs THL.
The virology laboratory of the health and well-being establishment has ensured on Thursday that the fifth fertilizer infection of East Savo is the same as that of the previous infections.
THL has ensured that the case of the same virus type as the previous cases of East Savo confirmed on Friday, 28 July.
On the basis of this information, all the infections found in East Savo relate to the first fertilizer found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not been exposed to other types of ash-free virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth disease could still occur between August and August and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor responsible for basic health diseases at Soster.
New fertilizers or doubts have not been revealed since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is important for everyone to take care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkila reminds us.
More information: Three new fertilizer infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - “Further infections or epidemics very unlikely –
Finland prepares for a promising race
It wasn't even considered to be legalized.
The background is that the process also produces methane, which is toxic.
The preparation of the shield at home is legal next year, but the legalisation of the score is not even considered.
The shield is made by use, pointing again.
As a result of the regulation of Tislaus, the process also produces methane, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate point-to-point soup for every man's right, government advice Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of points was not considered legalised.
It was not brought to a political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Mr Outi Mäkelä (Kok.).
He is at the negotiating group of political parties who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can't even grant your application for distillation at home in the future.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain eligible.
Importing says that there will be a simple rule for the preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol should be produced at home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cigar and wine, there can be legal competition at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law eliminates the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of the output, Mäkelä will specify.
The preparation must be so manufactured that the raw materials or flavourings produced in connection with their use are clearly detectable.
Under the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as you want, and alcohol from personals can be given as a gift.
You can't keep selling it.
The act of the shield is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Production believes.
A much higher change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 % of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft alcohol law is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will be processed by Parliament as soon as the season begins.
The assembly shall be held on 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well-prepared.
It's like the Parliament's already taken a stand, Mäkelä will be happy.
Oscar Pistorius was sued by armed guards at the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered chest pain, was tortured to the South African hospital for heart attacks.
I've already gotten out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers from his prison sentence at the Atterridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital by armed guards this morning.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prisoner's informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
In turn, the psychic of the family told me that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-yearly Paralympic gold medalist to prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall
The litters of the phone discussions between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, Mexico and Australia’s leaders, have leaked to Washington Post.
Trump called on the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, to put an end to his public speech on the fact that he was not going to pay for the proposed border.
The President of the United States called Nieto on the fact that this had been adjourned by the wall project in public.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published the first litterty Trump's call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call there was a strong exchange of words.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia must be “swidth, ”“ sad, ” “and stupid, ” according to Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on the housing of refugees in the United States.
Trump quit the call by telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call all day.
Georgia's massacre: Activists re-enacted in the hope of the right to racist lead
Ford Mercury's brand car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in the Georgian countryside and continues on its way to the bridge of Moore's Ford.
There's four black passengers and a white driver in the car.
The leader of the gang, a man dressed in a striped dress, takes a deep breath through his cigar and drags through the windshield.
Travelers are scared.
\"Roger, the n-o-man is full of shit.
- Out of the car.
The screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-introduction that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the shocks are real when the hanger is strung into Roger’s neck.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lyned two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though murderers are living among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in re-introduction arrangements.
“It is a disgrace in history, but above all, it is a burden that weighs on our soul.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia Congressman.
To him, re-equipment is an alarming invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe's inhabitants that injustice has never been corrected.
We want people who are guilty to be brought to justice, and we want things to be finally completed, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice, Brooks says.
\"We can't recover and make peace until we have the right to...
The M.O. will cover the dead victim's body in Georgia's massacre on 27.7.2016.
According to the FBI reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and its surrounding districts were suspected of being delayed.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty have been free for decades, activists have been aware of the motives of the delay all the time: politics and sex.
In 1946 the Blacks of the state of Georgia received the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election there was an incident involving a black farmer, Roger Malcom, in a fight between the landowner Barnett Hester, who apparently dealt with Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was told that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI data, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid $600 for Malcom, who was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were with their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before the Moore's Ford bridge.
It turns out that Harrison ordered and committed murder, the FBI's report says.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in murders and destroyed evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses.
Brooks says it's more like it.
It was a voting murder, he says.
\"They were murdered because they wanted to send word to the black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been controlling Georgia's bloodbath for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and imprisonable, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It's hard to look at the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says.
We don't want to talk about the delay because we have to meet our own dark side, the director says.
\"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through.
The exercises of this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen black people and 20 whites – met to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the presentation.
Wade Marble works as Greene's assistant supervisor.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the re-enforcement for many years, but the role is always as difficult and inconvenient.
I'm gonna feel dirty because I'm not myself.
\"It is important, however, that this side of history should also be displayed so that it will never happen again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are practicing their own language.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom yells and hangs on Hester, and he's upset that Hester's had an affair with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me?
Rascona or Hester will answer.
Then the punch goes.
And then all (at least all black actors) will bite into a laugh.
Greene laughs harder.
- Rascona's asking.
He's in trouble.
- Did I find too strong? - He asks.
- No, Greene's going to throw up.
I just don't think the white people used the word '-' at that time.
Yeah, the other black actor confirms.
\"It's a slang. You need to use a longer version. \"
The subject of the motion is unpleasant, but the room's power is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are squealing.
No one laughs.
Re-regression ends quickly and violently.
Sings, shots, and silence.
The woman dressed for the black funeral stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken for every other word.
A few ten meters away, five and ten viewers wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple in the river who's come to see the show from Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
They've been using Brooks' guidance on victims' graves in Georgia's pressing humidity.
Murders have turned from the story to the truth, and the feeling at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children tend to look at fake blood and mobile bodies and whisper to each other.
\"They're not really dead, \"the little boy's like he's gonna look like he's gonna remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who presented the lynchers take away their fives and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs the man who presented the local leader Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a tough show.
It's all right. The woman involved in the show will comfort you.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and actors gather together for dinner.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta will have a sincere discussion with the black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is difficult to find words when she describes the feelings raised by the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible things that they say and do people who look the same as you, precisely because they look the same as you, ” he says.
“I found out that there were delays going on,” he added. “They were called arrests.
On the other side of the room Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting on the same table.
He's already telling me that he's started planning the next year's presentation.
“The resistance of the news is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors of our chemistry, but it is also a educational experience,” says Brooks.
“This message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.
Growing up plants in stores: To this extent – with the removal of extra parts – really saves
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower weight already in the store before weighing?
What about taking away a big hat from the anal, though it weighs a lot?
The answers are very strong: for one, it is an expression of the most extremely exported youth, while others do not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used and who go home to the garbage.
I'm sure they'll identify it in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the Ruoholahden K-Citymarket, Helsinki, because many rip off, for example, the leaves of the flower.
From the warehouse, the leaves are traded to bio-waste.
According to the news published by the Economic Statements, snoring with vegetables surprises traders.
But how much saves money before weighing off the excess parts of vegetables?
How important is the need for sneezing?
We women test how the price changes when you take the magazines or you take them off.

Final result: If leaves the leaves and stocks to be cut off, saves a few tens of cents at best for one of the vegetables.
In percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
The total amount of these purchases would therefore have been EUR 1,20!
Neymar was out of Barcelona - the Brass Star signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian Lawyer Neymar has signed a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday nights, Neymar's representatives had paid the buy-in price of FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish league, for a purchase price of EUR 222 million.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past summer, the record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million from Paul Pogba, France.
Spain too brake the transfer earlier on Thursday, when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the purchase company cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money via the excessive amount to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a new home public at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will examine details
In addition, Barcelona provided information on the payment of the European Football Union to Uefa in order to enable the Union to determine the disciplines that might arise from the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish league, has suspected that PSG's infringing cash use of Ufa's financial fair play rules.
Uefa may punish a company that will lose more than EUR 30 million over three years.
According to Ufa, the transfer of Neymar is not automatically broken by its economic thumb.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the company’s economy for several years, but it cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with considerable sums, Uefa was reported.
PSG owns a state-owned qatatar company in Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by an former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

The attack in Kabul: Nato's soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber hit a military victim in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. According to the authorities, NATO was killed by a soldier and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber's attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's opinion, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol of NATO-Afghan army took place, bearing an individual by carrying an attack on an artificial explosive device.
The opinion noted that all the injured persons were stable and were treated at the United States Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the writers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, the area where it mainly lives in Shiiamuslim.
Taliban said he was behind the blow.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in the city centre of Kabul in a bomb attack that was the most devastating attack of the country's militant group after the United States-led troops hit the Taliban in 2001.
Violence stresses the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and the police.
According to the writers, the suicide attacks in Kabul over recent weeks have also made a significant contribution to the government's confidence, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA is evaporating its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke-free rules
The U.S. Environment Agency, EPA, passed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smoke smoke emissions during the Obama administrative period, after 15 states had challenged the Agency’s law.
The EIB announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called \"zoson\" definitions in 2015, late on Wednesday. According to the Agency, the decision shows its commitment to co-operation with the States.
\"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the States,\" said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, the Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions for one year for October 2018. According to definitions, the rate of smoke smoke ratio is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution is to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Office sued 15 mainly the democratic state, including the District of Columbia, and according to them the suspension of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental provisions of Barack Obama.
Trump's measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, air breathing containing ozone may impair the functioning of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in charge of Daddy had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the doubts, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before security checks.
The police won't tell us why the company broke down.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas separation and take the device into full public space, such as the public transport equipment.
The Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever planned in Australia.
Because of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match for the near future of a series of less than 66,7 kilos, met on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel offices in Los Angeles until Mikey Garcia, the unbeatable light-series champion of WBC, walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the master of the WBO's upper feathers.
Garcia won on Saturday at Showtime by a unanimous decision of the former four world leader Adrien Broner, and after that, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the five best groups of boxers on the comparative list.
Garcia handed out her right hand and asked: “How are you, Master?
Good luck with the fight.
Lomatchenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN channel on seven Saturdays.
When the twin poses for photographers, Lomatšenko manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be complete.
\"I'm an ex-sucker,\" Garcia reminded me.
\"I'm going over the series [63.5 kilos] for the Bronx, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light series.
He must rise to the light series [62,2 kg] and then we can take it.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fill their hopes.
Lomatchenko agreed.
- No, you don't.
Klamas asked whether the match should be organised on the payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko debytoi in the light series later this year and will be held next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 trumps). Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take a light series at Forum on 23 September.
\"The deal could be on the payment channel, because the fans have asked for it, Garcia said and later announced she was ready to fight with a channel that offers the best prize package.

I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement.
Garcia said she'd appreciate Lomatchenko as an unbelievably interested, and she might want to go see the Saturday game.
Lomatchenko cut off Garcia's throw and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked so slow.
Garcia said she was focused on showing the force and then boxing.
Men said they knew that the fight between them was becoming ever stronger and stronger.
This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match is as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case. Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said that he was waiting for him to fight the best. \"Mey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight.
Average wage of EUR 5 300, education of what happens - the situation of investment counselling has been wild and free
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot recently.
Last time, Helsinki’s words were told by Rita, 68 for whom banker’s investment advisors were talking about a full pump when selling investment products.
Investment advisors and different rules on the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
The gap is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define the competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 study.
The financial sector is an authority in the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investors Ltd, with experts from both Finance Control (Fiva), universities and industry.
The studies are of the scope of 12-15 study points, and their tests are prepared by Aalto EE, a Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both tests are quite broad in terms of requirements.
The study material includes 10-15 books, as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savik, CEO of APV Investors Oy, tells us that the percentage of exams passed is roughly 70.
Most of the employees of the major banks have performed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory in accordance with their own rules.
Then there are smaller banker movements without mentioning whose staff seems to have mapped out qualifications, says Savikko.
According to him, such banker movements have been changed.
According to Sakik, APV1 has been completed since 2000 by 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding investment advisors, approximately 3 000 people.
Some banker companies consider that the purpose of the examination is to benefit.
In most other sectors, there are considerably more stringent knowledge requirements.
Savik says that the Financial Recommendation requires the execution of APV qualifications, as it is the case for investment sector competence.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn a number of thousands of euros per month, including benefits for nature and commissions.
The average monthly average working time of employees is around EUR 5 300.
On average, men in employment earn an amount of EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500, respectively.
On average, the most profitable tens earn some €8.100.
Tens more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, a tenth of women making the most of the money earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been entrusted to the level of labour and mission.
According to Fiva, the examination carried out by him received individual cases where the qualifications and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the activities of the adviser.
Investment products can also, in principle, operate as a seller, even if professional skills and qualifications are at a smooth level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
In most other sectors, there are considerably more stringent knowledge requirements, Savikko says.
According to the clay, from the beginning of next year, this will be achieved by tightening up the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to ensure that investment services are adequately qualified.
Financial supervision, in turn, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor, Marko Hovi, tells us that one of the clear changes in the current legislation is the requirements for the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and investors of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements concern both the employees of the investment firms and the affiliates who sell the products on behalf of a company.
According to the proposal of the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva receives the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are precisely, these visions will be decided during the coming autumn.
In future, the company must also ensure the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has an obligation to provide evidence that this has also been done.
The benefit is specified in practice that the company must, for example, identify the staff’s activities at individual level.
This will certainly be the case with different requirements depending on whether investment advice or the sale of products is concerned.
According to the court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced than the time limit if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with the person meeting the criteria for a certain period of time.
As a result of the change, the rules are tightening and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

The blue coastal schoolers of Imatran do not stop at rain or sunfall - Iines Allakone's shelf with the help of the bathing bath
In fact, I was on my way to the good track, Taina Itkeen followed me.
Imatra beach break schools are running in Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, the young swimmers are not mute, the praise of the swimmer Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimsuits, a total of 13 children, next week ten.
In the coming week, the fact that school and eskari are already starting at that time seemed to be estimated by Itkonen.
The Imatra Coastal School is co-organized by Sport and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday at Liette's beach, there was a nice feeling.
The sun was heated and young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with swimsuits, someone without it.
In the water, the smaller sisters also enjoyed their joy.
It's the first thing I've ever thought about was getting deeper into water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to march towards the beach.
It's gonna be great!
Eines Alleone told me that he's been swimming a lot this summer.
He's a good one.
Like everything, Vili Huhtän, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swimming school was very much astounded.
Jami Kallio, 4 years ago she wanted to go to the waterboats.
Anna Villberg, her daughter, followed by Ilona Villberg, swimming from the beach, is a good start for swimming lessons.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna's been so happy to leave here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The U.S. Schools packed up on the docks.
The boys had plenty of room on the beach with a frog.
Milja Luuknen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread the towel wipes, nailed the fruit and roasted the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the docks.
It's like it's not in the summer.
With an unknown soldier selling toilet drills, there's a mutual story here.
All kinds of things you can see.
The Sini product made of cleaning products was used a couple of days ago in an unidentified series of military products.
That's, uh... Tits drills and laundry tapes... and Wc-hards on the edge of the brush...
The unknown soldier refers to the film and film marketing that he received this fall first night.
Yet there is something special in the combination, and the products have been removed from the social media: When will the unidentified health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Aino Mäta say, Vice President of Blue Product?
We're partners in the movie.
We're supporting this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural film, Mätä says.
According to him, the products will become a special feature and thus have visibility.
Isn't there something funny about this, often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is a mixed story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määtä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen an old Unidentified soldier.
And cleaning is not a guest for military culture, Mätä points out.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Salido, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichyt, which is known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, has been placed on the market.
Unknown products record already perpetuated by Finnish Photographic Journal blogist Kalle Kinnunen
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the movie's first night, so there's still a deal.
The unidentified partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, Jaostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were announced
The latest results of medical tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been announced. The results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80 % of the tests were established to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believes that the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Judicial Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be assessed more closely than the age of the asylum seeker. The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Office was criticised for failing to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be underage.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far carried out 6 880 tests, and the Legal Medicine Agency has now published 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and end July 2017.
The 80 % test, i.e. 2002 asylum seeker, was established to be over 18 years old, and in addition, the Legal Medicine Agency defined 25 cases that the test had to be carried out was, if possible, 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, the result was that the asylum seeker could be under 18 years of age.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there were doubts as to the age of the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Legal Medicine Agency says that the results are consistent with the results of earlier months.
“The figures are quite uniform. There are no major differences in statistics in previous months, ” he told The Local magazine.
Although a large number of applicants were identified to be over 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and announced that in 442 cases, there were indications that it had to be examined 18 years of age or older.
When Svenska Dagbladet studied the same results, it became apparent that in 243 cases the applicant had openly told that he would complete this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used for tests takes X-rays of the wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint. Then dentists and radioologists analyze the images. The method is also criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karoliinen Institute, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right thing to do.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't certainly determine age, we shouldn't pretend we're capable of it, he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: “It can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where you will soon have to complete 18 years, where the risk is about 10%.
Ilone fell 30 locations in Scotland
Five more par results in the third round were held by Mikko Ilosen 30 picturing down to golf in the European tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday day 11 but was found at the end of the round to share 41.
I'm happy to have a double box with three bogs in a difficult basement.
I'm sorry, but I've had a hard time with the others.
Ian Poulter, England, rose up to share one of the tops with one under the par round, even though he said that there was enough work to be done in the umbrellas.
The tongue was raw, but I crawled with it, and finally the day was good, Poulter's wind.
He's sharing a lead with his countryman, Callum Shinkwin, and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The governor of West Virginia is changing the party
On Thursday night at Trump's campaign event, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party.
\"The Democrats simply abandoned me,\" Justice said.
“Today I can tell you many prayers and thorough reflections... today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats...
The audience broke out in the popular favors.
\"As a member of the Republican Party registered as the morning, Justice added.
As a coach, I'd say to you, it's time for a new game.
Trump previously promised to make a significant announcement on the Western Virginia campaign event.
Trump won the West Virginia at 42 points because Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was elected governor in 2016. He is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an opinion saying: \"The exchange of the governor Justice is once again a new blow for a democratic party, which is more likely to build barriers than better America. \"
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the latest return to a party with no leadership and unable to find a positive message, a message that unites people, Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, said in his opinion on CBS news.
The lightnings have sown the damage that Thursdays are coming up even in the summer's very big day.
In the end of the week, you can also get more holes in South Finland.
Over the past week, in particular, the central and northern parts of the country and the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
On the night between the middle week and Thursday, lightning discharges lit several fires.
According to Meteorologist, Thursday may be a very big day for summer so far.
The Ukrainians have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, in particular in central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomen.
On the table, the lightning hit the electrical center of the rowhouse, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received an announcement of the fire about 15 minutes later on Wednesday.
The power station was located in the sauna room at the end of the rowroom.
The rescue plant bit the ceiling and the wall to find firewoods and shut the fire vibrately.
The total number of 11 dwellings was lost without electricity, but the personal damage was avoided.
In the cold again, lightning lit the outer building into manifestations in Harjuland before midnight.
At the time of the rescue facility, the building was already in the full phase of the fire, and the rescue facility could not stop the fire from spreading.
The outer building of about 50 square feet [50 sq m] burned to the ground.
On the road to Kuopio, the lightning hit the homehouse again.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stamping lightning strike.
The rescue facility was on the spot to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get the fire from time to time. Only a few mergers hit.
In the movement, the thunder caused problems on the train path between the Walloon and Vaasa, when the lightning hit the traffic control system.
This information was obtained on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was corrected only a little before 5 p.m.
From then on, train traffic has also been able to continue normally with the thundering section.
The lightnings have sown to destroy Finland across the globe.
However, lightning has been relatively small this summer.
These summer thunder stories have been completely dead! reviews The emergency meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
In the middle of the week and Thursday, the worms have been mostly moderate in their strength, but thanks to the little lightning salad in the summer it even seems powerful to many.
This may seem like a really bad old man, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's thunder, says Tuivinen.
On Wednesday, there were 1 700 times more underground, and on Thursdays there were potential even the toughest day of the summer: around 16 o'clock there were 1 790 underground lands.
If lightning continues to go on to the beginning of the night, then more than two thousand lightnings can be released, Tuivinen predicts.
The previous record gap was reached in 2015, with about 30 000 pieces of lightning in the year.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So there is still a point of interest so that this year does not break two years ago.
However, there can be an ongoing need for a blindskier.
According to the latest, Finland will also remain warm and wet during the final week, which is an acceptable birth-based environment for the old.
On Saturday, the capital of the old ones should be moved from the northern parts of the country to the south, where some 2 000 lightning days can be obtained on Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country, there is a more uniform saderina.
According to such a Tuvises, it's only a few.
Coe commends the Russian-avocative - apology for doping scandal
The World General Sports Boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology made by Russia on Thursday, which was due to Dopingsandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end the ban on Russia's participation.
Dmitri Shljatin, Russian general sports leader, said at the IAF Congress on Thursdays of the World Cup of the World Cup, that the ban that Russia has received is appropriate and that he intends to fight decisively against doping.
He said he was sorry, for all the athletes who were taken to the competitions for gold or shopping.
In spite of his comments, the IAF Congress voted for the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from the general sports competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA report had provided evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
“I think that his response today was very direct, and it was a very open presentation, ” Coe, President of IAF, told the journalists.
The Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian General Sports Union had admitted the country through difficult times and announced that it would do its utmost to reorganise its activities.
Coe said he was very pleased, too, that Russia accepted the conditions for the closure of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress, but Congress supports the recommendation of the working group that it is not time to end the ban on Russia,” said Coe.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system, he added.
Nine Russian athletes compete with a neutral athlete's status at the World Cup competition in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of IAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
“The study remains insufficient and the trainers who received the ban continue to act freely,” he told the journalists on Friday following the presentation to the IAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed Tom of Finland’s poor success
Tom of Finland's film did not come from success as the authors wished, says Yle.
If they're honest, I'm disappointed, you'll recognize the film produced by the Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June it had achieved fair 100 000 viewers, which is the budget of the film, about EUR 5 million, compared with little.
There's no lottery profit at all, but it's important now that investors get their own back.
If the film had been better off in the country, they'd already have their money.
Now, we have to wait for a small bite of foreign distributions, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions on the use of European football coins do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive playover of all time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, a European football player, which can prevent team participation from being a respected champion league.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair game economic rules, and according to them, PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary for the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to his star card, as it will be financed by the reigner trap enriched with the oil of Qatar.
The monitors can use large sums of money to buy players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up as President of UEFA on the initiative of Michel Platinum, a French player elected in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini considered that the debt to succeed was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners had their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair game economic rules moved from the bank's liabilities to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used in Chelsea for the first time in 2003. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of gambling and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of economic rules for fair play will last until 2018 and will be up to EUR 30 million will be lost.
Although Platin had to leave UEFA president's duties scandalically in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer, also wanted to control the reckless use of clubs.
“The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will also apply them in the future,” said Andrea Traverso, in UEFA, the Associated Press News Office last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-off payment, it may break the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded at an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of the economic rules of the fair game, the first fines were awarded in 2014. The largest fines were transferred to the PSG and to Manchester City, financed by Abu Dhab.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the Society was ordered to limit the league of the Masters to 21 players over the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its economic regulations by increasing their income through companies related to the owners of the association.
If, for example, the qataris company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as a normal income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support from the Qatari tourist authority to PSG was overrated.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be financed by the Qaar’s 2022 football World Cup Organisation Office.
However, the PSG and the Advisory Commission have denied that Neymar would be taken from the World Cup ambassador. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such a arrangement.
As a result of past PSG sanctions, UEFA will monitor more closely companies by circumventing the rules.
On Thursday, the sources that arrived from the situation reported that UEFA had not negotiated the transfer of Neymar with PSG.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on the condition that their identity is not revealed, as they have no authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, the net sales of PSG during the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and to increase the sales of accompanying products and toys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to make the transfer of Neymar more difficult, alleged to break the economic rules of fair play.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the company and the state,” said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish league, to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal Manageri Arsene Wenge also has reservations about the state financing the football club. Arsenal owns an American sports poet.
“The return is the result of ownership that has changed the football operating environment completely over the last 15 years,” said Wenger on Thursday.
- Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
There are so many interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the State.
Now is busy: Finnish MM athlete coach in gangs in Helsinki
Pity jumper Arttu Pajulahden and trilotician Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train general sports in the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkela may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti competes tomorrow at the length of the bath and Mäkele on Saturday at the triangle.
However, the coach of the twin, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this without the results of the British Embassy.
The coach has the invitation of MM-play organisers as a document, but it has not been enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or whatever, coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always dealt with visa issues successfully before, but now there is some problem.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It doesn't have that much meaning.
As long as someone's looking at the step signs on the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of the possible removal of his coach.
MM-mital for FinlandLontoo requires a miracle
The World Sports World Championships start in London today on Friday and last a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
General sports, landscape skiing and hockey are the species for which Finnish poker athletes are passionately able to view each other from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of poker athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from valuables to another where the experience of acquiring an experienced athlete’s performance to the level of genuinely possible adult MM medal.
Now, in the Finnish small MM team, there are no young athletes, and there are not even the brandies.
The MM-mital for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can also happen.
It pulls poker athletes off the TV screen and glues to follow the races, even though London's medals are solved from time to night.
Finland received one promoter from the previous World Cup of Sports 2015.
It's brought by a spearthrower, Tero Longmäki.
The crowds are waiting for a long scale now, even though the results of the last few years of his or her and the other shooters, as well as the survival of Long Mountains, are being run out of value games last summer.
Anyhow, long stays as a great Finnish sports hero in the history of these races.
Access to the final competition or making your own record is a good enough performance for other Finnish athletes.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt for Finland’s future years of universal sport will give a good success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite force of representative athletes.
The success will not come in a moment, but it will require years of sweaty work for athletes and patience, both for training and for poker athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope London's races will remain in history as a race between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of the fear of terrorism or the attacks of the poor.
But it's a shame.
The snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is placed in the second big air race in Colorado.
Copper Mountain has become number two in the world sugar of Rukajärvi's best big brother.
The women's race won the United States Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi gathered 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the Caballer 1080 for the first time in the competitions, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and a good file is now, but it's a shame that the last jump didn't go right.
Yes, I'm going to do it from now on in the races, too, Mr Rukajärvi.
In a big round of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from the jumper for the species.
Viking Linen's new high-speed ship hit the port in Helsinki
The new long-term FSTR of Viking's reserve company is very late on schedule.
The long-ship was supposed to leave Helsinki at 6:30 p.m.
In eight countries, there was a loading on the ship.
The ship's late for Helsinki.
At least a half hour, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car line moves a little, at the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for access to the ship, told me at 7:30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical flaw.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought access to the ship for water bottles waiting for its cars.
The Viking Communication Manager, Christa Grönlund, says to IS that there was a technical problem.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki for a few hours.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a few hours from Tallinn return.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn at 20.15 p.m.
The 42-metre special traffic interferes with traffic on Thursday night on Thursday night.
The 42 meters long special carriage moves from Muustola to the port of Mustola during Thursday night.
The transport from nine should be there by 11 a.m.
Police are running traffic on the Sixway, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
Transport from the mark point to the 13th port of Mustola is on the way.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Combade Detective
At the same time, both the days of the '80s and the '90s grunge (at this time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State shows for MTV) and their own times – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars moved on their career into bigger cases.
As a cultural product, it is both a parod and a description of a continuous reminder that we are stuck to during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already lived.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (for example, the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s voice was reported).
Vitsi's core is that middle-aged actors act like an ambitious fellow who approaches full-life, and their emphasis makes it impossible for the past to achieve part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parodia is more fragmented: for example, the 90s of stalkker movies, such as the horror film of the Hand that is wreaking.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller bearings and changes in the pattern from 1991 to 2001.
Many stories are the same as before.
The heart of Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not been over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one of the crazy lines is accompanied by Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his partner in crime, George H. W. Bush (who appears to be Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best are bystanders.
It is especially fun to see an iconic Paul Rudd, who has a beard under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon-soul patch, from the film Singles.
The moments of random madness may raise this series as a recursive Seven Up! series until it receives its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. At its last scene, a friend group goes to Wet Hot American Summer on his first night.
The Amazon's Comprade Detective series again appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series of cold war for the spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series for the printing screen, where the East meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas, a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
In the mains, as a tough girl, Gregor and idealist Iosephina, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici will be seen. Their turn is doubled in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea.
But it's not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (politicals spend time watching TV chess in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Comrade Detective remains too attached to tracking the socialist drama – for example, the killer behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often starts to feel like a colludant propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not abundant enough.
As an agitprop-satair, a better series could work, even if Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visited by the US Embassy and there are two fat men in the lobby, all in a covetous hamburger.
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can do all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaged Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were on a tour of our own recent history and their history.
Kouvlalainen Toni Taurus will rise to the ring in Macao on Saturday, against the former UFC challenger
Toni Taurus wants to keep the fight up.
Mr. Toni Taurus will receive a hard bone in Macao, for last year the Brazilian Landro Issa was still in the UFC organization.
Brazil also has a black belt and a world championship of juju.
For once, I'm taking myself against my parents.
It's funny. 32-year-old Taurus tells me.
The Kouvlalainen had to rise into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The deal was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three campaigns were received on a quick schedule to the Chinese self-government area in Macao.
Taurus has never met one of those before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying, because getting ready and training took a lot of time.
The complainant is pleased, however, that a new time for the struggle was reached.
A week's wait won't have much effect on getting ready.
The transfer doesn't make any sense, because it won't be right in a week.
The condition can go even worse if you're now practicing too much.
The Taurus has faced some of the opponents in his previous struggle, whose strengths are in vertical action.
This time, the situation is different.
The father of a comedian describes him as typical brasile.
He's quite aggressive.
I'm guessing he's going to come on hard in the first round and try to take him to the mat.
He's won the world championship of the jury, so he's got a lot of weight.
The previous Kouvian match didn't go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Bellingon hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never been so very capable of him, he didn't get a hit.
When I left to pour, he hit my eye.
It's been a long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers take one year, some get closer in the ring.
For example, the future opponent, Isssa, was the previous one in September.
The Taurus, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now there's another struggle for the past year.
Sometimes the pace has become heavy.
I've been training in recent years and in good condition all the time.
But I've only been fighting for it.
When a 32-year-old heard about the future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training, and I was happy to do it back.
We got really good training when there was a guy from Sweden.
It was a great help to practice, as on Saturday, a Kouvian will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been given training against the same size of opponents and training for vertical action.
If you're able to fight, it's a 32-year-old main act.
You have to hit it rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take the property myself.
They must not be given free because they spend the most.
Macao attracts Taurus previously in China.
I hear it's China Las Vegas.
I think there's a big night ahead.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inefficient and that speculation on inflation has ceased to increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank moved interest rates because more pressure is being put on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Board decided to hold an interest rate of between 6 % and 2 %.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and it also warned that there would be more pressure on income levels for households, as inflation is expected to continue to grow close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the Bank, interest rates are, however, needed in the coming years to reduce the inflation that Brexit has accelerated, and the bank also announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected on the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which was to be implemented one year ago in the follow-up to the Brexit vote.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to provide a cost-effective funding to the banks of 15 million, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision states: \"The Commission's forecast for policy is that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years when household real income declines in consumption,
In the case of interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for some tightening of monetary policy - more market expectations - more broadly - to reduce inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
The Bank, however, stressed that the potential increases are - and limited -
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
It now held its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
In relation to the dollar and the euro, the rain deteriorated as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound fell by 0.5 per cent and was $11,31 per cent, which fell by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was EUR 1.11 per cent.
The decision to maintain interest rates was made after the expected lower growth rates were reduced by increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain in 0.3% in the third quarter but to be slightly squeezed at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope of rising inflation and low wage increases to households, and the Bank said that the situation would deteriorate even before it became better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent a drop in income over the next few years, but it expects wage developments to recover considerably at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak shortage, which will repeal part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rates were calculated to 0,25 per cent, following the result of the EU referendum which fell to the weight decrease.
The Bank considers that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to be seen in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the recent decision by the central bank, interest rates had started to be called for more and more when inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% interest rate in July.
Inflation was shortened to 2.6% of June 2.9% last month, but according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation tightened again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the increase in the target level of 2% was due to a weak level.
\"As the recent decline in swap interest rates is taken into account, competition on the mortgage market would seem to be aggravating further when creditors are looking for customers and wishing to end the year strongly,\" says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“Markets seem particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is about to end, and they are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are costly alternatives to:
NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial HIV medicinal products
As of September, patients can be assigned “overlapping medicines” such as anti-HIV. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicinal product in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that approximately 10,000 people were assigned pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) during the first three-year trial.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the court court held the Supreme Court's last-year judgment, which states that NHS is able to pay the PrEP medicine, even though it claims that local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, the leader of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday to be \"a significant new intervention\", and the national AIDS organisation described it as a crucial moment.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive registrations that extend in October to other clinics. Try to reach their full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) should be used prior to combination with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV control in risk groups.
The medicinal product to be taken prior to combination means that the body has sufficient drugs to prevent HIV infection during the period of integration.
The medicine can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose to meet the conditions of the experiment for male, female and trans-sex and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People who live in England and report to general medical care can also apply for a test in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs 10 million pounds and the UK NHS signed a contract of medicines after the international invitation to tender this week.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of a PrEP medicine by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
\"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the range of already existing and increasingly active means of preventing HIV,\" says Stevens.
“This is another important achievement in the struggle for the greatest health challenge of mankind for over 30 years,”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, Head of National AIDS.
If PrEP is given correctly to people who need it and are at risk, it may have a reverse effect on their HIV epidemics in England.
Since September, the risk group will receive NHS through a trial, which they will be able to decide independently on, without the need to negotiate with a partner, an effective effect that will improve the lives of a large number of people.
This was welcome to the news.
“Now it is most important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no risk group is excluded,” says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP medicine used for the trial has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection.
“The beginning of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that lasted for many months due to government slowing down,” says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
“We have evidence that the medicine can have a reverse effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
Try to help us understand better the real benefits of PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible across the country, and this is how we can protect HIV-exploited and make a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped.
Quality of living: the outer layer and smart interior solutions have made a small home from Earl's Court.
The former banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's time-style house, which tells us that Joanne hasn't packed and changed.
“This is before I live in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment, ” says Joanne.
I was looking for something similar in my price category.
I went to the apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as in my silloy apartment.
I was thrilled right away, and I made the offer on the same day.
After that, about 90 square apartments have experienced a complete transformation of shape.
It was a double with only kitchen access in the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as an intermediate floor to make room height used.
\"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands, he says.
He hired a job at the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Erfan Azad Hill. Erfan was able to use the space of nearly four meters high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not exactly enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
\"The steel structures are pretty complicated.
The facilities had to be reorganized so that they did not have to ride.
The structures had to be modified in such a way that the height is just right on and below.
Erfan was able to place two full-floor rooms on top of his fascinating details.
The outer floor opens a retrouvius copper-rustic window to a stylish living space.
The hidden furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's Vintage lamps create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theater, feel and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem to have a real length.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window that opens up to another room.
Inlets with mirror-shaped furniture have a storage room for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
The more style the kitchen gets hidden when it's not used.
The kitchens equipped with the magic door are not a new solution,
But Joanne's kitchen is a unique fact that the door will be raised in the same way as the garage door.
\"It took a little design,\" Erfan tells us about a steel-definition DDF door.
\"It is balanced, which means it is very readily slipping into place. \"
With a sharp use of space and storage space design, Joanne received 16 extra square blocks, another bedroom and even a better basic solution.
“When the building is sold, the area will be decided – or the property’s appreciation –” says Erfan.
In the event of a return, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price according to the area of the price:
In Joanne’s apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the farm.
“The property is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnels in the apartment are partly generated on the basis of them,” says Erfan.
No one's getting attached to the power lines on the walls.
They're important too, but they're not the same.
Joanne's apartment is an example of good design and additional organs being able to make a home with exceptional quality.
It may also happen that the apartment does not want to be moved away.
Princess Sofia, who was pregnant, was beaming in her summer class.
The man in Princess Sofia hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad the last time she was born.
For a Sustanable Tomorrow dinner, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the occasion as a smile.
Swedish princess Sofia has visited Sweden this week in Båstad.
On Wednesday, in the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar, Sofia was represented in a beautiful blue body home, which was wearing the latest pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue settlement.
This is the last representation event Sofia represents before she was born.
His calculated time is in September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by big earrings and a stylish little bag.
That's a great princess.
Sofia's been on a mission this week in Båstad Sweden.
Sofia's a full-blown living on a little bag.
Sofia was very bright in her summer log.
Sofia even became interested in the event to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said she was laughing and referring to her love for the rest.
He'll raise us with a sweet chill.
In the summer of 1996, Lahti appeared home where Thai food was sold.
The Gulfmen didn't dare to taste, they walked by.
At home, food was sold by Panya Sumsri-Penttilä, known as Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not know Thai at that time.
Because people couldn't go to dinner, Panja offered free taste.
Thus he taught the Levites to eat Thai food, spring roll at one time.
Try a taste, he said.
I got caught up in the bag.
I went more and more, eventually, every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai food in Lahti's commercial hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were fewer than 20 clients.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit by the boatside.
When hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
We got to know our little sister better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with a dictionary to teach Thai.
Two years went to the mall, but then the restaurant had to be changed, because the spices themselves made say they'd get too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the trade hall's end.
There's room.
Now we deportors are allowed to sit in our own tables again, only during the most depressing times will we have to ask the guests to see if there is room next door.
The banker knows his client.
They're telling him about the rumors he's been in and who he's seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen the different stages of life for customers and the mess changes.
He remembers what kind of man I used to eat at my first spring roll.
He remembers me lazy and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own seat next to the kitchen door and change your hang-ups with the Panja who hangs in the bar.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet Chilic sauce.
He has opened our taste in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
At present, many talk to her about thai, thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been friendly.
He's busy.
On top of the restaurant, he's in the fungus and mustard.
Last week, the restaurant celebrates two decades of seduction.
We customers got some corncakes for dessert.
Without a alarm or attention, this important day went by the job.
The discovery of underground support revealed 173 Isis terrorists, who were ready to hit Europe.
The safety authorities received a list of important aspects of anti-terrorist work from early years.
The list contains more than 170 data from the Isis player who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, there are 173 people and the document also includes photos of each other.
More than 130 people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The remainder is Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now, the location of the list and the information contained in it have been specified.
According to the newspaper, special forces in Iraq's army found terrorist identity and a list of photos when examining the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities estimate the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists to fall down in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, the inventions, as well as information from the person's country of origin.
The list also contains the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J., on the list, reads Abu Assid al-Alman, a German.
He is told that he left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join Isisi's lines.
He's got a suicide bomber written next to his picture.
There's no more accurate information about the fate of a man.
A total of 6 000 fighters have left Europe, with no certainty of their fate.
The man went under the surface in Tokoinra Helsinki
Based on your interviews at the rescue facility, the man wanted to show you how to swim.
Even a spider can save a life of death.
In Tokoinra Helsinki, a person under water was saved on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the head of the Helsinki rescue facility, the situation was quickly over.
A person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The lifeguard diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The Rescue Department received a notice after half four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to first-care care.
Estlander says it was about 50 years old.
On the basis of the interviews, the man wanted to show you how to swim.
The situation in the Tokoinra is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard Agency and the police.
It was the task of the Border Guard Agency.
The divers were also a fine guide.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars ran into nine people in Eura, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, says the emergency firefighter.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident occurred at a three-way crossroads at four o'clock a day.
Kolari happened when the other car turned after the warning triangle in front of another car, says the emergency firefighter.
According to the rescue facility, there is an hourly limit of 80 km in the cruise area.
Brothers are fighting over $500 million of real estate property
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, which is related to their Italian family 40 years ago to establish a family company.
Former Chairman of the Carlton Football Society and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in Torak's value area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court to dispute the division of property and business property between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family company since 2014, but the divorce is a bitter challenge.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 real estates worth over $30 billion. The family began collecting property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street street in 1973.
The family set up the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into 160 movement chains.
The trade chain was sold at USD 85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in suburban areas.
According to the agreement with the former father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as the bearer and the central character of his family.
According to the case-law, the real estate ratio means that Colin owns some $316 million of real estate and Paul's worth of about $ 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
“I believe that Colin’s proposal left the best real estate for himself, ” Paul wrote in his first oath to the law in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court for the first time after several conciliation companies.
Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from his business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true, and he's blaming Paul for the poor treatment of some property.
Colin writes, together with his first illustrious testimony, that he would like to make a decision on the matter.
According to our Italian traditions, the family is most important to me, and Colin notes in his opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of interesting statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being discussed by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and delicious shops at the end of the 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought trade in Brunswick.
They were used to buy a real estate from Collingwood, where Colin founded the first family jeans store.
Colin tells me that he was established in the last few years of trade reading when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old) –
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their boys in agreement.
“Luig often said that he did not want brothers to end up in court, ” says Anna in her opinion.
The two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a series of financial conditions for their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian football league board and TV star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to this 2015 biography of life.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
The only answer was Colin, and he said in his text that there was no right to comment on it because it was dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and, according to the name of our family, to bring me into the battle, ” he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s requirements.
Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way, Colin continued and expressed hope that there would be a solution.
On Friday night, hope seemed to have passed out.
We're going to be in court in the near future, Colin wrote.
Trump's new Head of Staff intends to limit the media use of the President.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of news so that the boss does not get so often into trouble.
Editor Josh Dawsey reports:
“When John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of Staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he spoke about the main problem he intends to resolve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all information – both printed and heard in the press – must be carried through him, because the President makes better decisions when he receives good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship for decades with television – and as President, he continues to look at a lot of television.
“If President-in-Office Trump was nervous about the unfair news, he was in favour of a more fairer discussion of the media, ” said Sam Nunberg, who worked as adviser at the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
At that time, a politician named Tara Palmer wrote that, according to the previous six campaign workers, the use of Trump Twitter is essential to ensure that his personal media flow belongs to a level playing field.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump Twitter would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don't know – perhaps Trump's twiites would have been even worse without their efforts.
We probably never know what kind of messages Trump left behind.
If his staff has even been able to prevent problems caused by him a few times, their work has not been vain.
However, no one has been consistently able to prevent Trumpi from causing it.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their case by giving Trump information that supports their views, and that information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counsellors deliberately question the President.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
“The current and former employees of the drum say that he can become so angry with the magazine magazines in which he is criticised, especially if they are told about harmful information leaks, and then he has to know exactly where the data came from.
That is what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President a copy of the news of the GotNews.com website, founded by Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several years of information from the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and cancelled them later, and he did not provide concrete evidence either.
However, Trump had begun to read the case after the interview with the staff in Walsh.
Goldmacher added that the then head of staff Reince Priebus and the White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still self-impulsive and his assistants will continue to run their own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian Lawyer Neymar has signed a five-year agreement with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Previously on Thursday nights, Neymar's representatives had paid the buy-in price of FC Barcelona, which played in the Spanish league, for a purchase price of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore cancelled and was free to move to the PSG.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past summer, the record was at Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million from Paul Pogba, France.
PSG owns a state-owned qatatar company in Qatar Sports Investment.
The Society is chaired by an former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Orane explained alcoholism and the fear of flight by hypnosis: “I’m fine in my life.
From TV books, the time of Rose and the pure white sheets were known as the success writer Raija Orane just spent his 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren, along with writing, keep their grandmothers, that she and her husband, Jyrki, gave up Spain from the sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now they also left the rental apartment in spring.
The light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija took depression and alcoholism from which she has survived.
The external nature is also 20 kilos lighter.
The pressure went down when serotonin medications were stopped, they were mood medications.
I used to get help from hypnosis, which also made it to fly, and I won it.
I've been out of alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, it says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orange have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Jyrki Orane, who worked in the tourism sector, has been together for over 40 years.
I asked for it, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raina laughs.
Such a drama queen she's always been, she's stopped living that way, Jyrki's laughing at her wife.
A large library of writers, Orange, remembers only good 44 parts of the purely white sheets of TV series, which touched and moved the sheep time to Finland.
I finally decided on the part of the Raikka family company in the clothing industry when I read the 50th anniversary interview on Liisa Seppälä.
I was the daughter of a sewing player myself, and my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I work as mannequin, orane remembers.
He felt that a series of plots and stories changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savilainen's investigation and her argument revealed it, orane says.
Raija Orane lives as a writer for active time, has many manuscripts under the work - ideas of hundreds.
The Kiertos returned to the alley of over millionaires.
The most wealthy house owners of Western Mexicos are once again with the self-employed circulars who managed to cross the wheel that the municipality wanted and return to the field next to the houses.
The Kiertos parked their 20 trailer near the street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the circuit-definition whites they had brought with them children, horses, and the army of vans.
The Kiertos managed to cross the passage point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Deprived residents have accused Solihull of lack of authority to solve the problem.
An anonymous resident tells the circulars that came Monday night about Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers by stone.
“It needs to be hard to act because it seems completely inability to solve the problem.
The Kiertos were here in May, and then they left but they came back again.
They became more and probably even more today.
The resident told me that Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
\"Asun Streetsbrook Road, it is frustrating to pay a municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the orbiters returned so soon after they were driven away.
“They have been more than once, and they have even put the horse down into the park.
According to the Solihull municipality informant, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road.
From the point of view of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many local as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
This will help to form an overall picture of the situation for judicial proceedings.
Human beings surrounded by Portugal’s demise
In Portugal, men who have been forced on the beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the forced landing, two people died last night.
Two men flying the plane can be charged with the death penalty.
At the very least, in Portugal, 16 years of imprisonment may be obtained.
A small plane flying by men had to make a technical mistake yesterday, due to a forced landing on the shores of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran off the landing plane into the water.
The machine hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit a man who was on the back of the plane.
Soon thereafter, the machine rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
She's parents didn't get hurt.
On the beach, the small plane was surrounded by enemies right after the crash.
A girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, told me that the case was in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha's paper.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle that more people didn't die.
Two men in the machine were not injured by the forced landing.
The Finnish star whose leg was tragicly lost again won the World Cup: “I would not be the world’s champion, ”
Matti Nagy-Hamar celebrates early on Wednesday morning Finland's time for MM-cultivated banked game competition held in Canada's Big White.
Big Hamari won earlier in the contests, too, cross the MM-angle.
All of the MMs have been raised by now by three.
Pretty incredible MM-playing games!
Two times taken care of gold, with a pretty good heart rate, the Great Hamari, who was determined by the phone, was happy.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and well-prepared preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamari, the number of interviewers in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paralumbing has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are falling, and there are a lot of new veins.
Always wondering if someone's gonna come after a black horse.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Big Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to get along with his friends since he was young, and the accident had not taken him to the slope.
After all, I've been thinking about what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's unnecessary to cast.
On those cards, they play what's shared, Big Hamari's stressed.
It would be cruel to have a serious accident and loss of the limb to be a lucky kick, and the Great Hamari won't do it.
But he turned to a terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be three times the world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Big-Hamar's biggest boarding machine was already climbing.
The speed went to the top after the accident.
I trained when I was young with my friends, and we always killed X-Games.
But they were far-fetched dreams, which were somewhat dimmed over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow out of that X-Games launch.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and drowned.
I decided to pull the hammers and get to work.
I'd say I've done quite well.
The slower was very happy about the choice of Leo-Pekka Star to be the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winners received their prize in the sports gala held in January.
According to Great Hamari, star victory is an important signal for parasourism.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parasourism world.
Since it's time to launch a double world champion Matti Big Hamari Year athlete campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best.
Not yet, the Great Hamari has taken over the tops of all his desires.
Next year, we will find a major goal.
A year later, there will be Paralympics in South Korea.
We'll get the medal out of there!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and Isis leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey was conducted on the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees were roasting bread in refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of the Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The regime of Trump does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of Arabs in nine years.
This year A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees researched the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, the survey was carried out by a total of 400 Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were made in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will continue to return to their homeland in the future.
42% of respondents may think they would return to their country and four percent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people on the return of home affects the war in Syria, as well as the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) of the end of the war is considered to be the most impressive factor for a permanent return home, whereas the fourth thought that leaving the country would be the most important thing.
Only less than one tenth will bring the most important factors to an end to the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone is not a solution to the conflict
The Syrian youngsters were asked what is important for the conclusion of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more important than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair fourth considers Al-Assad’s President to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half of the experience is that, in order to bring an end to the ongoing Syrian conflict, both political and military solutions are needed.
In order to resolve this conflict, military action alone does not believe like a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see Isis's power weakened over the last year, while the fifth is experiencing a stronger power.
According to the respondents, the most important battle with the Personals, and in general it is against terrorism that the media conveys people information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many were the primary means of military action and training reform.
The 10th fair feels that it is most important to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every fourth one believes that the Syrian conflict will deteriorate in Trump's period.
The views are divided into two aspects of whether Russia and Iran's involvement have improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coded to keep the Internet in order - he developed a database using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the fastest growing world-wide database of open source code.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by Michael-Monty, is not paying users anything and can be developed via the Internet by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but paying customers do not necessarily exist.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and readily available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there,” explains Widenius.
The Widenius, a technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time using codes.
A handsomely distant man will contribute to ensuring that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL with a billion dollars, and one year later, the software waste Oracle colluded Sun with 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade happened, a large part of MySQL's developers announced they were leaving.
“They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not promise a certain future for MySQL, ” recalls Widenius.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun for twenty best developers, and I made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
MariaDB's code development freedom of control was established by the Foundation.
“No such certificates were made during MySQL,” says Widenius.
Although many people have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion store, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
“Our growth rate has been about 50 per cent per year for the last few years,” says Mariann Paqvalén, economic director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which concentrates on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is short of the company's characteristics.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services that are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps in exchanging databases, which can be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
MySQL's switch to MariaDB will succeed in a moment, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are customers of MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to its customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we're connected to the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest television operators, game companies, banks and even some central bank, the Paqvalé list.
There are still giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oracle, too, is modest from a branch business compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
Although Gartner said that the largest database companies in recent years have lost market share, players such as MariaDB are still inefficiencies, although rapidly growing seals.
In the database market of about USD 50 billion, open source databases do not even survive billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only for money, since most users do not pay anything about these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced by open access or transition at the time at least started.
The large companies do not receive new customers because most of them next select an open source code.
This has led to the fact that licence fees for commercial databases have jumped to the clouds.
The companies want to make as much money as they used to with a smaller number of customers, Widenius is thinking.
Since the exchange of the closed database is difficult, most of the customer companies have been listening to increases in prices.
“There are a lot of customers to whom the transition is really difficult, because their old applications and others are stuck in the closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the clients is coming full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer will move sooner or later into the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from earlier, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if you want.
Many companies, however, are facing major changes in the system while transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the biggest growth funding granted by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide, with the intention of hiring more.
One of the reasons for EIB’s funding was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
“A number of countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively,” says Paqvalén.
Widenius is upset about how to spend money in Finland, for example on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say the open source code is idealology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do something that it can't or can't make.
55-year-old Widenius belongs to other Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, alongside the most well-known promoters of the open source code.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on an open source code.
I am still holding 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this issue.
Italy's hard-to-be attitude towards the civil society rescue teams
Italy has warned NGOs who, on their ships, save refugees in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to operate unless they commit themselves to comply with new rules on their activities.
“If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to work, ” said Minister Marco Minnitti of Turin in the interview with La Stampa, the Finnish Minister of State.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German Jugend Rette's ship, whose crew is suspected to have cooperated with the human traffickers who promoted illegal immigration.
Only one year ago, the relief organization refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area, the organization announced in its opinion on social media.
We can only assess the charges when we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rette since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees directly from human traffickers who re-used the boats.
One such incident is claimed to have occurred only a few miles from the Libyan coast, which is reflected in the prosecution's document, which has been published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the region, and is considered to be a motive for helping people.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who controls their activities.
Only three NGOs participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that they would regard new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they do not cause any significant changes or obstacles to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct, Nobel has been hired by doctors without borders.
On the other hand, Minnitti stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, as evidenced by the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local city leaders will produce results.
“In the last days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel, ” the minister said.
He pointed out that the plans were to continue discussions with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his open mate at Enontekio, a suspect found in the ground, a case for the prosecutor.
A suspected crime occurred in Enontekio's Kutus last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish open mate.
It has been said before that they were both seasonal workers.
The police have also told me that after what they did, the suspect would have fled to the ground with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the ground, and he did not resist when he was caught.
We've got to get the case up in less than a week.
The case may still be located in Lapland's senior right in August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and All-Creeping Friends, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy is dead at 91.
The actor's death reported this family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started her acting career at the theatre at age 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter's movies and his veterinarian's role in the All-Warden friends' TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was described in total through seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for suicide text messages
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered to have given up her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, completes 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
“My police have broken, ” said Conrad’s father in Thursday’s session.
My son was my best friend.
Carter applied for an amendment to the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be dealt with in the field of freedom.
He was threatened by 20 years' sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy buffer, listened to the hands of his judgment on the cross with a crying look on the ground.
His actions killed Conrad Roy, the prosecutor said to the court.
He decided Conrad's life to heal his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility. The prosecutor continued.
\"He has not shown repentance,\"
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by a tragic situation that Carter deeply regrets.
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that neither Carter nor maturity nor even mental health problems had a significant impact on his work.
The D.A. reads the statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she told me, \"It won't take a day for me to die my beloved son's death.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this, and I'm trying to comfort his sisters in this pain we'll always bear.
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was “worrying, ” the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and not be aunt to her children.
It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born.
The case appears to be a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car for bull poisoning dead in 2014.
The case raised national attention when it turned out that Carter had become proud of his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
“I don’t know that there are many ways,” said Carter in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the two weeks prior to his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: “You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start a generator, and you’re free and happy.
Judge Moniz said that Carter was paying attention to Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by submitting interviews.
The case has been divided by experts' opinions.
Only a few have been defending Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion by Knox, which states: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.
Secretary-General NATO: Means the worst then cold war in Russia
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented the Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday by Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, and Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the Cold War ended, we were hoping that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, in particular, following the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability caused by Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that tensions do not get high.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the collapse of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, the US President Donald Trump was able to say that he was even at a dangerously bad level between the US and Russia.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the bad, necessary Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Audi will make changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a stroke experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi notification, BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said that the company believed that \"more rational options than driving restrictions\", he referred to European cities, such as the BMW hometown, Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines on Tuesday to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a reconnaissance.
European car manufacturers have made a strong market for the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the US to achieve CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installation of neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been charged with the co-operation and abandonment of major car companies.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed on cars cheating equipment that reduced emissions in compliance with the regulations.
Several charges against Volkswagen leaders have been raised in the United States, but the activities of the leaders are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the last month, the former director responsible for thermodynamics in the Audio Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a trial.
Previously this year, the Audi was drawn to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which was suspected by the authorities that Audi had installed a system of its cars that could circumvent Europe's emissions requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audit investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the share of the luxury car manufacturer Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
The vote on Venezuela began with a lively study, major demonstrations in the permit.
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result, the President of the National Election Board, Tibisay Lucena, said to the journalists.
Maduro convinces the crisis to come to an end
In Venezuela on Sunday, a representative was elected in a controversial vote, which is intended to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has criticised the vote strongly and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its own demonstrations in such a way that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces in the country began to take over the parliamentary building of the country on Wednesday night.
They are intended to ensure the security of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens the Lavender of Provence
Laventel has become a symbol of the Southern French Provence region, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Laventel had decreased due to drought and diseases, and researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Laventel is directly threatened in the Province of Provence, because it has suffered over recent years from the effects of climate change, with a marked reduction in the rainfalls of spring and, in particular, in autumn, in the province of Provence, an expert at the Institute for Agriculture, Eric Chaisse.
- This will shorten the life of the Lavender.
In addition, drought has brought many small cats to the region, which spread micro-bacterials.
The bets are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“ Instead of all the stars and big flowers, we now have smaller flowers, which are either poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether, ” says Chase.
\"In other words, parts containing essential oil are even less -
The solution is sought by increasing the watering process, slowing down soil moisture loss and injecting the plants with a mixture of clay and water.
The supplier's murder is a growing threat to Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper once a week is usually held on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Singola.
Today, however, safety is being discussed because of recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers will discuss which one is safer: leaving their children home or involving them in the delivery of a grenade strike in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the room board: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask for names from suppliers in each group, and proofs are not needed, observations and feelings sufficient.
They write names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and suppliers who are suspected to be government or drug cartel paylists, and they are criminals who make Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Trade Marks Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. The Federal Protection has 589 suppliers who have been attacked and threatened, and at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodoce, the supplier and the source of inspiration.
“The fault is to live in Mexico and be a journalist, ” said Valdez, one of the many books that deal with drug violence.
Riodoce’s building’s public wings are covered by a huge picture where Valdez shows the center finger. The picture reads: “The right to the 30s of suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that are decorated with the smiling face of Valdez. Valdez has a penthouse with glasses and a trademark.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death. Journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office was established, in particular, for the processing of cases of suppliers, but only two charges have been raised so far, according to the Committee on the Protection of Editors.
It is only rare for journalists to be sued, as is the case for thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime murders every year.
The editors of Riodoce are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety meeting is of little value because the killers are not known and there is no hope of right.
\"This meeting is, in fact, a waste of time,\" he says.
We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why this is happening.
Valdez had removed from Riodoce’s delivery in the state capital in Culiacan this morning on 15.5.2007.
He had driven only a couple of blocks of tours on Red Toyota, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired 12 shots. The amount is supposed to be linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove out of Valdez's car, and hit it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was killed by a wife and two adult children.
The rumors move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a cry for mouse.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and was expelled to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
On the streets of Salloa, one or more people are killed every day, and in the cemetery there are two - story tombs that are larger than many homes.
The state of the coast is “rare, ” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that is war against the boys of Guzman.
The story could have been made up by the sons of Guzman: the customers suspected of becoming members of the gang bought each number as soon as the newspaper came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the other magazine declared an attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste, when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodocen. At that time, the shares in the newspaper were sold at $50.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem, says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine began to know its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
The journalists criticised the possibility of publishing a high-class study of journalism without fear of it, and readers in the paper were fascinating things that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prize of the esteemed Maria Moors Cabbot award in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received an international press release prize from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, without any sensitivity to the story of the drug trade in Mexico.
He was open to admit he was afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life, ” he said, when he received a commission from the Committee on the Protection of journalists.
The drug trade is in Sinaloa, the way things go, Valdez said in the interview with Rompevito TV last October.
“A witness must accept a mission that falls upon him, or be shown stupid.
I do not want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?
Riodoce's staff needs Valdez, a joker who curses like a port worker, and they need a friend who always had hugs and advice, and they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He used the hat all the time.
He went to the other El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to reflect on how best they can do their jobs and remain alive.
The Roma do not like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out, Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-esteem and self-esteem,
trusting in your own instincts.
If it feels like it's not all right, you have to stay away.
The problem with Riodoce's supplier Andres Villarreal is that, in the case of Javier, the impact can be disappointed.
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
The mobile phone was not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce was trained in safety training. A few days earlier it had appeared that only the spying programmes sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied to the shadow of the tree for protection from 40 degrees of heat.
The State Government had ordered them to guard Riodoce’s premises located in a nelicered building in the Central Class of Culiacan region.
Some of the suppliers were estimated to be half as though these two police officers belonged to the 50% that the governor of the state did not regard as reliable.
It had been months since journalists had been running drug gangs in mountainous rural areas.
To this week's number, Riodoce's delivery planned three main things.
The size of boxing was Julio Cesar Chavez's brother killed in Sinalo.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's money was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to move carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and public authorities.
The supplier found out from the public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a political party in the institutional revolution (PRI). PRI has controlled Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in many cases receiving publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of them “El Chapo-Guzman’s son managed to escape and avoid military raids.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column had reliable information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known what had happened earlier,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the pet name ‘El Flaco’, Astrosine.
\"Now all the connections between our sources of information are now outside: \"
Valdez's office has been changed to a warehouse that preserves counter-promoting signs and stories from suppliers' persecution. The employees of the newspaper have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists with freedom of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few sign with him when he left the next morning for a demonstration by the local prosecutor's office, which was the reason for another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the West State of Michigan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, was found to be Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loud throughout the country. They are interested in walking and building – SOS Press – texts.
Today, Director Bajorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
He has since asked that he be transferred from matters dealing with the government, because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that there was organised crime around journalists in Mexico, the authorities that allowed crime, and the uninterrupted society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on the suppliers last year were carried out by the police and authorities.
\"In what way, people will be silenced by killing,\" says Ramirez.
The murder has a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of a blogger, Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border State of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a message signed by Zetas cartel near his body: “I’m here because of my articles.
Her head was cut off by the computer's keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to end their activities, as El Norte’s newspaper in the North Chilen border State after Miroslava Breach’s painting murder.
Some continue to operate, as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on his website to drug cartels: \"What do you want from us?
Some of the suppliers have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and there's got to be a way around it all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for the supplier's hands, as appears to have been a photographer to Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in a house in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled from Vracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to become a poet at one time, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
I became a reporter because Mexico is on his way to hell, he's telling me.
Some time ago, the Riodoce suppliers sat in front of the delivery at midnight with a beer on their feet when the new issue had been completed.
19 people were killed at the Maztalan quarantine meeting in the shooting between the rival gangs and security forces.
The war grew, as the messages from the cartel found in the area were promised.
The reporters put the news on Riodoce's website from their foot-to-mouth smartphone.
I was supposed to make it another day.
Siren are closing in close proximity – a new shooting scene.
Bajorquez looked at the delivery of security officers:
If they were scared, they would cover it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive image, where a man shows a middle finger for the entire Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that he can't even consider stopping the operation. How could I stop the magazine when our intern asked us to get to the street to do a case on the same day that Javier was murdered?
Hannu Manninen's Olympics project began with a huge setback.
In April 39-year-old Hannu Mannis' party was short because a professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the training period began at a disastrous rate when Mannine became infected with the flu.
It started a long period of illness that took me nearly five weeks.
In practice, the May month went completely ill.
The first was flu, and finally, children's disease like ear infection, where I had to eat an antibiotic.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't get used to practice, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanonom.
Test result collapse
The world champion of 2007 was granted a training permit only in the second week of June, which was shown at the KIHU Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a carpet, which is speeded up every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete's finger to the needle.
Last fall, I spent 32 minutes on tour, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There's a fire against the wall. Manninen's telling me.
In the right direction
After the start-ups, Manninen tells me she's been healthy.
I've done a wide variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I've tried to normalize the body's metabolism.
This is a really good five-week period.
There was also a half-week vacation from flight operations.
I've had enough with my family to go to the cabin.
In the last season, Manninen was only involved in four world Cup competitions before Lahti's MMs.
The best result was seen immediately at the opening competition when Manninen rose to the top 18th.
Guidelines drawn
Master coach Petter Kukunen has made a training and competition plan until next February.
We're now going to get a different kind of rhythmary exercise from last year's practice.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have three World Cups weekend.
In December, at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau, would be involved.
At the end of January, the plans should still be included in Seefeld.
I hope after that, the name will be found on the Olympic team list, says Manninen.
The Olympics of Pyeongchang would already be the sixth Summer Olympics in career.
Now, the most important thing is to keep healthy, at Salt Lake City, 2002 the Nummelite's bottom line at the gold team contest.
Dinosaurus protected himself from his enemy by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of the entire creature of the Canadian miner, which had been so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaur Mona Add.
It had been so well preserved that researchers could even determine that its suspense skin was red-brown and had had had a problem with the past.
According to the Current Biology magazine, it has been best preserved in pansarded dinosaurs and in the world’s best species.
The recently found fossil is nodosaurus, which lived between 110 and 12 million years ago at the average stages of the accession period.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossils to be very significant.
According to the National Geographic magazine, a pansarded vegetarian has been the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in Suncor Millennium in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and it was found by Shawn Funk's miner.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his discovery in more detail.
The fossils found in the prison were sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, a beast was dug out of 1 100 kilos of lice.
The results of hard work are now visible.
“If you turn your eyes off, you can almost believe it was asleep,” says Science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
\"It remains one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs of the dinosaurs, Mona Lisa.
The leather studies showed that the meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to be a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and it was a walking armor wagon.
Its red-white armor masked it from predators, and also protected it from darker colouring and brighter from the top, which continues to occur in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend into its environment and avoid enemies, greater dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and it is now exhibiting at Tyrrell's Royal Paleontolog museum.
The researchers have named it Borealope, according to Mark Mitchell, museum engineer. Mitchell was part of the team, where more than 7 000 hours of digging dinosaurs came up.
Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's veins and armor.
They found that you still protected it in the animal world from a general coloring that is darker and lighter than your body.
However, it was a surprise that Borealope is significantly greater than the current animals with similar colouring.
It can be concluded that the meat - eating dinosaurs were so contaminated that evolution favours survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
Modern animals, for example, peuros, serapros and armadillos have similar colors, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The landing of a large, heavily pansarded dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the accession were, ” Brown says.
The chemical analysis of nodosaurus suspensive organic compounds reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions on its life, among other things, studying the content of its intestine to find out what it ate on its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and went to the sea where it sunk on its back on the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to go much further than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish skin has been preserved and has been preserved in its original form,” Brown notes.
\"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
It does not require much imagination: if you turn a little eyes on it, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.
The period of accession was the period of the teropods, the vast two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus Rex, or millions of years before Boreelopeta, its mighty predecessors may have caught this armored dinosaur.
For example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster, about 11.5 metres long, belonged to the predecessors of Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, and they believe that Borealope was screaming from the sea after his death and emulated in the mud.
It was found in Suncor Millennium in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and it was found by Shawn Funk's miner.
According to the museum, it has kept the world’s best armoured dinosaur with its leather and pansars into the hips.
On average, nodosaurs were five metres long and weighed up to 1 300 kilos.
They've raised two half-foot peaks from their stage.
Scientists believe that this pansarded vegetarian passed through the present West Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in the seabed.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its skin remains in the armory holed plates along its skull.
According to Michael Greshko, the National Geographic magazine wrote that such survival is very rare as lottery profit.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still a phossilated leather in its larvae plate.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scars of that foot base.
How did an activist learn to answer the question: who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment on bed playing Facebook with his phone.
Then he noticed the message from his high schoolmate:
\"The police just killed a young 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street.
When he was ashamed, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. Therefore, he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retreadings from the user @TheePharoah.
A username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis, who was twitting in real time from Michael Brown's death.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's body on the street where it was left for four hours.
This is incredible, Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter the same night later, people were told that he would collect the Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police's closures and screaming people and Brown's father, who claimed to be themselves, who said, \"Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son. \"
Ferrell followed a real-time video camera where the police stood in front of the protestors with a dog barking.
He also tells me that he saw a video where the other police put their rifles and shouted, \"I'm gonna kill all of you... animals... \"
It's not normal, Ferrell remembers what he said.
It was not a murder that we have already used to and could be regarded as typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.
He booked the return home for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up a six-year-old from his daughter's father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Fernando in almost three years' time has been done on documentary film, which received its first night at cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and mental expression, love and loss, as well as strength and blasphemy from the perspective of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell was on his way to Ferguson's flower check and their daughter who was dressed to the crown, they had again had a conversation about what it was like to live black and in which conditions they had spoken of it countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how black people had to fight for the things they believe in? Ferrell remembers his saying to his daughter.
- We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right.
I couldn't leave my daughter with me. Ferrell told me later.
The events of this day are... the height of past events.
My daughter has the right to know and to grow up in it.
He must be prepared to act and organize, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living black, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from dirty racism, he is still like other black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality.
Their first stop was the South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, where activists were waiting for information on the case and finally found out that no charges would be charged against the police.
From where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually started to react to the activation in a new way.
“At the University of Mission in St. Louis Ferrell, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of nurses with minorities, and at that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
I had no experience in organising.
Something just happened.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to simply tell us what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was a bit suspicious, and he asked: “Do you really want to tell me what is happening, or do you want a story that you can use?
In the background of the doubt, they were countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and sinnipotence.
“We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice, ” Folaya recently reported in the interview. “We wanted to do things differently.
Folaya had already contacted the assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity with the sentenced prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project with six other locals.
\"This is not a document where someone speaks for us or speaks for us, but we speak,\" says Davis.
“I was most important to the way local people were presented in the film because I was presented in the same way.
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was intended to show that it was not about the charismatic leader but about the community, but that Ferrell proved to be more transparent.
That is why the document shows a surprising private side of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
I felt rather naked when Ferrell told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
\"But I realized that this work and the human description of the blacks require a certain vulnerability,
In addition, Ferrell's story times and brings again the role of black queer women at the wider Black Lives Matter store at midnight.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot the black teenage son of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are linked to the queer identity.
Ferrell says. “It’s because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
The black queer women have been through everything.
Folayan agrees: “A lot of black women are really maintained, including a lot of queer women.
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the purpose of the document because of its queer identity.
He's got the energy going. Folayan says.
\"It's no coincidence, however, that he was in the front line, the black queer women are living in a lot of things at the cutting point, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy's coming from the white man.
The new description groups have left Fernando long ago, but the Community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell's still got two and a half years of parole left, and he's got a warrant to shut down the highway in protest.
His description of the social climate at home is short and core: \"Several.
Yet, he continues to rely on the hit clause that he learned from the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It's our chance to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our hands.
A suitable perspective: artist creates images of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has hung in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, which can be more clearly observed.
These 30 works are the portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth prison, where he passed his 35-year sentence, and Manning was sentenced to leaking classified diplomatic telephony to the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Reemblance was opened on 2.8.2017.
There are two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transatlantic and career-wide dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama has reduced his term of office on the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA from algorithm and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, yet a little theoretical position on the ability to modify DNA data, the causal relationship behind complexity and interpretations and identity.
Chelsea Manning, of his birth name Bradley Edward, has openly told women of his identity since the break-up. In 2013, he was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one photo of Manning, sentenced to prison: a structural, black-and-white Self, where he is in the car, sitting on the driver's seat.
Dewey-Hagborg had a major popularity project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
There he created designs based on criminal technical data, and he received DNA data from tobacco clogs and gums, for example, and created pictures of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case, ” Dewey-Hagborg announced a new exhibition at the press conference.
So the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his prisoner suddenly became correspondencemates, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even did together a Suppressed Images comic book, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo, which describes the future in which the President would reduce Chelsea's conviction and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning's judgment just a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky accident after the seven tough years in a nationwide military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now, when Donald Trump fights his own war against data-creating and trans-creating soldiers and finds new ways to strengthen the powerful chasms that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that \"all have a purpose...
On the gallery wall there is an artist's statement, and under it, the great title of Manning, where the point of the last name is the heart. In his presentation, the artist requires the end of an automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
The opposite wall has the Manning DNA episode: a long line of C-, G- and A-books written on lead.
With this 200 letters – or a nucleotide – as the scientific definition used by the artist belongs – a combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
\"I'm helping people understand that we're equal from our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretations,\" says Dewey-Hagborg.
\"DNA tells countless stories, and it's like 30 here.
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with his hand a megaphone.
If they get you down, they've won, they'll read it.
- Don't ever turn around.
\"Tekst is the letter I received from Manning,\" says the artist from Philadelphia.
\"It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold colors.
Unlike the comic book described, Manning hasn't seen the exhibition yet. When Manning arrives, they greet him with his own genetic data based on faces like a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intended, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA episode is written at a lead height, which is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
“The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring them into the crowd, ” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to describe Chelsea’s mass movement, which was also behind his release.
Professor of Northwest University and employee of Oxford University are being looked for as a suspect in murder.
Police reports that they launched a national search to find a professor at Northwest University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of being stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury home.
According to the Cook County Court documents, on Monday, arrest orders were issued from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to the local information published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several slice wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and stabbed as murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiological and immunology at Nortwester University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of the University of Social Relations, stated in his opinion by e-mail that Lathem is now free of administrative power and is prohibited from access to the Northwest University campus.
\"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwest University helps with the investigation,\" Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent financial assistant at Oxford University.
The opinion, which sent an e-mail from the University and Somerville College, states: \"We have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are prepared to assist the US investigating authorities in all possible ways:
The opinion also noted that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
The Chicago police chief of information, Anthony Guglielei, said that he would urge the suspects to give themselves seriously to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and we keep looking for them, ” Gugliel said.
According to Gugliel, local, regional and national authorities are helping in search of suspects.
He told me that the police had received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an vague hint that 1008 had happened in the apartment.
The police described the view at the scene to be terrible.
According to Gugliel, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Latem and Warren had been in the building.
\"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair,\" Gugliel says.
The Grand Plaza Management Group published the following information to the residents: \"We should examine the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.
The man threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London.
\"I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic,\" said the police.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and to kill all Muslims.
According to the Indepent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them in on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt got caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to what happened in the bookstore.
The authorities noticed that Moffatt was dressed in the same order as the suspect in the bookstore, the police informant said.
I'm not an anti-muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a penalty, a man must complete a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay around €620, i.e. €690, legal costs and 85 pounds, i.e. EUR 95 for compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard, several hate crimes are not reported.
“We will complete the action under the WADA road map in the near future – – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko
Vice-President of Russia Vitaly Mutko said that Russia will soon conclude the measures under the WADA Road Map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
“The measures in line with the Road Map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was able to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
WADA’s road map has been updated in these parts, but Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s road map, setting out the conditions for restoring RUSADA’s powers. The second part of the road map was published recently on the organisation’s website.
According to the fact that it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
\"All has been reported and all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympics Committee and WADA in the near future. Mutko added.
However, one of the points of the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of the investigation of the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko said: “The study is ongoing because our antidoping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we can't admit that we didn't exist.
In the words of Mutko, Vitally Smirnovi, President of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee, had echoes.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport Sports Media on the same day, acknowledged that there were problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies. “We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to approve this report, but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, when the doping scandal's scope had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
The director of WADA, Olivier Niggli, visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July. After his visit, he stated that the organization was on the right path towards the restoration of powers.
British Organization as a skeptical for Finnish beloved innovation: There is no evidence of the health interests of maternity packages -
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packs.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust against the Scattle Academy prohibits the use of its own brochures in British maternity packages.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lllaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity pack would reduce the risk of death.
Drain death means an inexplicable sudden death of the baby.
Lllaby Trust acts as an expert at the British Health Authority on a child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official submissions to be packed into them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization has informed us.
Finland has one of the world’s lowest children’s mortality readings, only two dead thousands of births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is a result of a number of different reasons, such as a small number of teen charges.
The fact that there is a box for each family may be one of the factors.
However, it cannot be said for certain, Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hide mortality.
Maternity pack is a Finnish invention and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for a free period of 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed by it meet all the security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no security standard for cardboard boxes.
According to Lllaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no fault or soil bed.
The organization recommends that the packaging be used only for day-to-day purposes and that it stop using it at the point when the child can turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or wet.
He ran away from the Japanese zoo for another time.
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has been surprised at the speed of the staff and has already escaped again in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in West Japan on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the entrance.
It does not die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told me.
The escaped 35-year-old frog is female, 55-pound and about a mile tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
In the open hours, the frog will be free to travel in the taran area.
The zoo hasn't been given eye-to-eye observations from the turtle.
The last fugitive in the house happened in the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I saw it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues to help, and Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we can ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy said she wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online shop startup business, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured me that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
The company has 75 employees.
And so he decided to stay out of external aid.
The market has become more and more new start-up companies in human resources, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employees' commitment. Businesses can carry out surveys and target them to certain teams and groups of people, and provide anonymous reporting services for their employees and in some cases direct contact with the government over the top management.
“The health can be followed by applications such as Strava and Fitzbit, but where Fitzbit is staying, the founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employee commitment.
This has been using the Glint's software for three years, and he tells us that he has had a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
In addition, it can draw up a map, which can be seen with one eye, with which departments employees are less dissatisfied and which leaders have received the lowest estimates.
Businesses have understood that they need to follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. There has been a crash around the transport company since the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are being bullied and punished for problems.
For startups like Glint, such failures are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are the global industry, which can be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
In Denver, the Convercent in Colorado is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate use. The interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It's recently made an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make customized surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers may be informed of inappropriate behaviour by an anonymous text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager's misconception, the complaints go directly to the company's government.
“The general opinion has been excluded by the authorities,” says Patrick Quinlan, founder of Convercent.
He would point out that if the company treats its employees badly or does not work in an ethical way, the consequences can be expensive, even if the authorities are not concerned. Consumers can start botling the company and it can also lose workers and become a challenge to justice.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has spent more than a year on Convercent, since it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and easy access to the main office.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or e-mail address that was able to report to the main office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a scary and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, the legal director of Ruby Tuesday, who said that complaints made by workers were difficult to follow.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be identified and dealt with more quickly.
“I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
\"In the same way, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment relationships,
According to Quinlan, companies started to be more serious about ethics, values and employees' commitment after Arthur Andersen broke down as a result of ethical activity in the context of Enron scandal.
Only with social media did companies realize that they could no longer prevent their lynches from publishing.
“The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics,” says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is the business model and possibility approved by the venturers, and both Glint and Convercent have the support of the venturers.
Convertent collected $10 million in February for companies such as Sappshire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised capital for a total of 47 million dollars.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has collected a total amount of $60 million.
Investment is not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, workers expect more from their workplaces.
In the market of competitions such as pilaakso, good wages, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a truly useful company.
“Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, Head of the Linkedin Company responsible for employees’ remuneration and well-being.
Investors get returns when companies are successful, companies are successful when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee commitment, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, information on employee commitment is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken.
If the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be regarded as a sign of change.
And if the change is not done quickly or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee commitment.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to conduct four thousand discussions,” says Russell Raath, President of Kotter International, the management consultant, who has seen companies rely too much on the collection of information.
\"If the company does not take action, the workers will start wondering if they were to be heard.
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to this report, Madison Reed is currently making staff interviews monthly and able to cope with the problem on the same day that it is reported in Glint.
After returning to the slowness of decision-making and to the quality of communication workers, he was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training in order to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the stability of staff in the long term industry, which is known for the high degree of change of workers.
“If the company is not committed to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees,” says Vitrano.
If it loses workers, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked female neighbor, reports TT.
The woman in Göteborg had come home from the shower when she had noticed her window outside a cell phone hanging from the end of the bitch.
According to a woman, the cell phone camera shot me in the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress up.
After she had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon thereafter was recalculated into the window.
A 20-year-old man who's suspected of being a covert has admitted that he's shot a woman.
However, he claimed that he only photographed a woman's face.
The video on the phone had been deleted and the police had failed to restore it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but he has refused to commit a crime.
His description was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor as a madman.
According to the U.S. News Office TT., a man will be charged with the case.
Teachers require more liquid in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed, said OAJ President Olli Lukekainen on Thursday.
The temporary operation of the public sector holiday payments highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements where the review would not in any way involve the cuts in holiday money.
Only after the private sector has signed up for contracts in the local sector and the increase percentages are clear.
Luke predicts that, for example, the work conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luke did not yet reveal.
This is also the President of the Juko of the Public Training Organisation.
Link: Holiday money surgery increases earnings differentials
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of the public sector's employees is diminishing while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday cut will further increase earnings differentials.
In Finland, how many students can be per teacher
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the best and least able differences are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are decreasing and differences between pupils and regions are growing.
When NCAA reduced daily exercises between two together, I held the day of the Bruins players.
It's almost 11:00 a.m., a bunch of UCLA football players have been left to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs will shine on the hair after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training, students at summer courses will return to the dormitory to read the final tests. The next morning they will meet at Wasserman Football Centre.
\"The three days will be followed by the punishments for these friends,\" says the Bruins coach Jim Mora a little before the Monday shift into Tuesday.
The aim of the change was to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the last final tests are held.
That is why the three first exercises in UCLA began over seven nights. It was hard for players to find space for themselves.
The limitation of the exercise coefficients in one day means that there is more training days than before. The camp began this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six ongoing Westwood training periods when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Practices are planned to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation of the season opening match begins: UCLA meets the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that he supported the NCAA's changes in the rules, even though it made players' schedules even more stringent.
“We’ll load them very much for three or four days, and it'll be very challenging, ” Mora says.
But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think it'll make it easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
The UCLA will shut down the exercises after the outside camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the parking area next to the training fields and the Luski Center, to a level-level hotel that has already been bombed on footballs flying through the back of the goaltop.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available outside.
We have security, Mora says.
“The fact is that people can book a room and describe exercises there for video, and that is not an excessive concern.
The video described in practice is pretty much paid.
But we have guards in the parking area.
We're doing our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom to Rwanda
In Central Africa, Rwanda, the presidential elections are held on Friday, whose winners are already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagamem is officially pursuing his third period, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group of RRFs ended the extremism committed by the extremes.
Kagamem was Commander of RRF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for breaking the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of the distortion of statistics on poverty.
For the third period, Kagameme will be able to seek because the two-year Constitutions of the Presidency were amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a true leader.
In his day in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and international investments have flown to the country.
In addition, Kagamem has played a major role in bringing together a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagamem has promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised to its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against liars by increasing the efficiency of checking facts
Facebook intends to send possible false news more and more to independent facts and submit the results under the original article. The largest social network in the world announced this on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning for the identification of false. Possible falses will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being the greatest liars, and many believe that liars had an impact on the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has emerged in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded in liars before May's presidential elections and Germany preparing for the September elections supports the plan of blocking social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in its separate opinion published in Germany that the examination of facts is being carried out in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
“The people want to see which stories do not pass through independent inspectors’ circles. They also want more background data so that they can make a more enlightened decision on what they read and share,” wrote the company’s blog by Facebook’s Product Manager Sara Su.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and make other changes to his news feeds in order to reduce wrong practices.
The birth of a comic book: The story of one of the castles
Today, a small Scotney castle in the counties of Kent is known as the Squeeze Music Video and Margaret Thatcher’s hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
It has, however, 700 years of stormy history, and now this lovely place in the Bewlin River Valley is a theme for a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned motif writer.
It's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago.
I feel personal when I hold a letter in my hand.
The Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Mediterranean. Each story has been imagined by a different artist, a promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not a book based on Rhodes’ first archives. In 2014, he appeared to Dead Men's Teeth and Other Story, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library.
“I was tearing with tears in my letter to see a thumb print. The letter had been written by a double agent working for the jacobites in the 17th century,” says Rhodes.
It was his print!
And the letters smell like smoke because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives.
The author who was in old papers was allowed to stay in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council in England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days studying about the Victorian New Year’s War, archives, treasures and rares, such as the wall hanged hyenas and hundreds of thousands of bottles in the mooring.
He traveled around the old castle with ruins and facilities and discussed with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes pictured artists.
In the evening, he took whiskey and started writing.
The closer history of Sconey is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just about to start the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held by the same method for hundreds of years: taking all the extra ones to the swimming pool.
Archbishops had journals, letters from time to time and maps of who owned anything.
I thought I'd think we'd let it be.
Part of the story is going from prison to history in England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who will soon be associated with the castle after graduation in 1381.
“The Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
“The English housekeeper’s rebellion began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin from the sea.
Maybe these events are connected.
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle – like The Priest, the story of the priest, hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler again tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 1700s. He says he staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stone (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotland.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problem by getting married to wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to deal with the heirs.
Now Rhodes is going to get some more writing tests.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life in the early 1900s about a sanatorium that has left only a restored plot.
Sconey's castle has a special place in his heart.
It was sad to leave there, he says.
I didn't want to go back to this evil day.
The worst thing about Russia was the Cold War.
The military union between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented the Secretary-General of NATO on Thursday by Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, and Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the Cold War ended, we were hoping that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, in particular, following the illegal accession of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability caused by Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so that tensions do not get high.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the collapse of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, the US President Donald Trump was able to say that he was even at a dangerously bad level between the US and Russia.
Trump called on the countries to thank for the bad, necessary Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitsko will stop the replay against Anthony Joshua.
Long-term world leader Vladimir Klitsko will end his career.
Klitzko of Ukraine, 41, announced its decision as Thursday morning.
In Atlanta's Olympics, 1996, Klitzko, who hit gold, considered 69 times as a professional, winning 64.
He held various MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury found him at a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitsko met with Wembley's stadium in Anthony Joshua, and then, after the whirlwind fight, he lost his ass in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitzko were expected to meet in the re-election in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitsko did not find motivation for the fight.
I spent a few weeks of taking a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley match, Klitzko told me in his release.
As an amateur and professional fighter, I'd like to start my second career after sport.
I could never imagine having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at Klitzko's reasons for his decision on the video.
Klitshkon manageri Bernd Bönte reported that the termination decision was difficult for Klitsko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been seeing American actor Hayden Pantheter since 2009.
There is one child in Pariskunta, a daughter born in 2014, Kaya.
Klitzko's Big Brother Vitali is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the MM accounts of different alliances at the same time.
Finland’s weather breaker is rising under conditions: “Vie from the file,”
Seedhead Minna Nikkanen has suffered from circumstances during the summer’s outer rail season.
Minna Nikas has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman from the file.
There are also unstable conditions in London's World Cup.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer as a seafarer against Minna Naikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was impossible that I didn't even get the little pigs to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Insbruck race.
I've competed and trained here on the way to how many times and I've never experienced the same variable wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, even in exercises, to have had such unstable winds, Nikkanen said in Kalev's competitions.
The weather also spoke on Thursday in London.
It's been rather challenging to get the technology together... whether it's cold stuff or what.
It's been cold and wind, and it's taken from the file.
It doesn't make sense to spend energy in a bad situation.
He got his gray jump 455 thanks to the World Cup.
It's 445 out there.
Being in London is not the same for everyone.
We have to have a toast and wait for better wind.
The goal is to cross Friday's box at 460.
Why don't you change your training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany.
I was able to jump into the pool and standardize the technique.
I should have done the same thing now.
It's normal for you to get to practice in the hall, and now the hall's been stuck.
What would be a wonderful race?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
A little wind goes too, as long as it's standard.
A experienced ex-con official was pushing politicians up: \"We have no room for distribution now and for many years. \"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, the Juha Sipilä government has to keep in the hat and beware of the budgetary expansion with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for distribution.
Yle interviewed Virta, who lived in 2015, in the midweek Ykkösam.
The next year's budget is about to begin.
Recent proposals by politicians to increase the guarantee pension, to reduce car tax and to support electric bicycles Virtanen will be regarded as election calls.
They mainly say that elections start to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the distribution when you owe it, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtane stressed that all the debts were due to the children.
Virtä has a long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he started at the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and subsequently worked as Deputy Head of Budget Department and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he was chief of staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in Yle's interview that the projected three per cent economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a peak that will already be set for the next year, and Finland is expected to grow by 1% for ten years.
Washington will change the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules on permanent residence, i.e. Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The applicants from the new search process who know English and can support themselves and have useful skills for our economy, Trump said according to the media.
The spouse of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margareta were shot in April.
The Danish Queen Margareeta, 77, and his wife, Prince Henriki, 83, is not buried next to him, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the rulers' couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's Room has announced today that Prince Henrik did not want to be buried in the Rosilde Penitentiary, the court notes in his announcement on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent of his role in the King's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his roles and title in a Danish monarchy, Hovi’s communication manager Lene Belleby commented in the paper.
The decision of the Prince not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated as equal with his mate.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of the desire of her spouse for a burial site and understands the decision.
The moment of horror on the road: the car was on the highway
Tom had two small children on his way.
They did not get hurt in an accident, but they do not receive money from insurance if the other party is not targeted.
It happened at the Keimolaport in Vantaa.
Archive figure from the construction site of Kehä III.
Vantaaan Tommi tells us that his family survived on Tuesday at a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, his open mate Riina, and two small children of the couple, drove on a highway to Keimolaport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
The body III of joining the Hämeenlinnavälä was speeding along the white car, which was to drive the family car to the village, says Tommi.
If it wasn't for the press, the car would have been on top of Tomm.
I broke up and turned the car at the same time, and it left the hand, Tommi tells me.
The family car ran into the air at high speed.
The parents and two small children on the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little less than 3 years old, the other is less than one year old.
Apparently, it was pretty good luck for us when nothing happened.
No one's missed was even driving towards us, even though there was a busy traffic.
The accident took place at approximately 5:20 p.m.
Tomm says no one stopped by and the family called 911.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The ambulance and rescue staff came in and the family was checked.
The car went to the redemption facility.
Tommi tells her and her small income on the open side, and they got some relief for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family doesn't say Tommi's gonna get the money from insurance.
That's why the family hopes to see witnesses from the car, which is why the family drove to the rails.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was likely from the late 1990s or from the beginning of the 21st century.
He thinks the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the guilty person doesn't get caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or something knows about it is connected to the police.
The Uusimaa police department and Central Uusimaa rescue department confirm that they had had a mission on the scene of an accident on Tuesday night.
Title and story corrected at 21.15: Unlike what was originally mentioned in the case, Tommi said the other car didn't come up to the front of the opponents, but had to drive from the accelerator to the side of the family's car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jappiste deals with human relationships with humor - Self-responder will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
The Lotta Jappinen from Kouvola brings his premiere to the What? Theatre.
The self-proclaimer is a musical theatre performance that has been dissatisfied with past human relationships and inconsistency.
The director, Lotta Jäppinen, says it's still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
You don't have to stay in debt for your old feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, a circular summer theater performance has been carried out with a long-rural budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance is challenging to consider what man reveals when he comes to know a new person.
Maybe he'll take a role, or will another coat come open?
A drinkless presentation confuses the fact and fiction
He's been driving the show and he's dramatizing the show.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of texts from the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that, even though the presentation is about the thoughts of young people, it speaks of all kinds.
The latter points out that the self-proclaimer does not directly tell about his or her own relationship with the group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own precious world will care about the show.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I don't think that relationships, especially relationships, would be a condition of happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jepinen believes that the self-proclaimer is drawing up a current picture of young adults living in Finland in 100 years of age.
According to him, many people have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka are present.
The working group also includes the pusher Ella Snellman.
The composition of the music is Jeppinen and Rokan.
Love for the Theatre started in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, is a director of the theatre atmosphere at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's been two years, and there's another mess in front of me.
The skipper's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun over the Kouvola years.
The music classes have been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and played in the University Theatre in Helsinki and the latest in the City Theatre in Turku.
The guidance has become more and more interested.
The self-proclaimer received his first night in Helsinki last week at Narri's show.
About 45 minutes of a long-lasting performance also saw at least a Jäppinen study town in Turku.
Self-proclaimer in Kouvola What? Theatre 4.8 at 19 and 5.8 p.m. at 14 and 19 p.m.
Finland's Olympic winner recovered for a year from the terrible Motocrossonnettom - the necklace broke
A few athletes in Finland have similar untapped natural power to Janne Lahti.
There were hundreds of days in the Kumpares accounting around the world for 20 years and after their dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement of the Gulf continued.
He was not only a tired intern, but also a experimenter of new species.
I don't think there are many forms of exercise on earth, which the conductor would not have tried for at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new.
Finally, one hobby was to stop the Gulf completely.
In 2014, Lahtila had a motorcross accident.
As a result, his neck was broken and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I've been licking wounds at my house for a year, says Lalela.
There was bad luck at the bay.
He also admits that the age could have been a part of the trouble.
You know, driving on a bike might sound a little fun.
But I didn't get the limits.
It's just as a species that's so hard not to do too much of this 40-year-old thing!
After the accident, Latela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
The back was a long run-out in the Japanese freestyle country team as the main coach.
Lahtila started in the nest immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15. I had to be there.
I didn't really do much.
Even during the training period, Latela often challenged its cover in the slopes and in the physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I'm really enjoying it because for once, I'm actually the only one who could have been.
The mandatory break inspired the Gulf as the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd be burned out.
It's easier for you to find places that have gone off than just plains!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
He started the Finnish freestyle team as coach about a year ago.
During the same time, he found a safer hobby in the place of speed species.
I changed the motocrosses into a Frisbeegolph!
I mean, it just got out of here right now.
At the worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although the Gulf itself has always been a superintendent trainer, he does not require training to be the same as he does.
I'm not gonna force everyone in the same fashion.
In our crop culture, there is room to be their own kind and ways to become the world's best.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahti says.
Sex robots come and we have to worry about
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot sector – just when it started to feel that 2017 can no longer become more strange.
Yes, it is.
The sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
“We must begin to take serious account of the generalisation of sex robots,” says Professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield of the Foundation’s founding member and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingers.
\"We're going to have a lot of sexerobots, but they're already being sold, and we're going to see them even more,\" Sharkey said the report at the press conference.
Sexiukes have developed from blowing dolls to robots with a warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence-based features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to his or her own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the eyes and the type and color of the fingers.
The more worrying, too, is that robots have \"personality\", which makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
The sex cells have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the nature of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even though it is shy.
True Company Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigit Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is an adventure and so on.
“The personality of Roxxxy Gold is adapted as fully as possible to the user’s personality, ” the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of mental areas:
It may be tired, in a chat mood or in a mood.
There are many worrying features in the generalization of sex robots: they replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is women's underselling and direct rape fantasies, when users approach, for example, a programmed robot.
True Companion compares Roxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
\"Women have a vibrator, why can't men have sex robot,
However, sex robots are not just fetis or new sex toys.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual relations, where subsidization is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell much about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively until the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become widespread at the same time that women's rights are threatened across the world and the White House are sitting in the President who has been blackmailing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying of its powerful figurative language, such as pictures of the dead body and out of the missing eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprising short journey.
Sex robots are tried to do as much as they can with real women (with porn stars ratios) as technically possible.
Robots developers want their skin to feel genuine and that movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
Their personalities, however, are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history – nothing that is indicative of independence or that violates the fantasy of complete surrender.
They are pleasant servants.

Police suspect: two acts of terror were planned in Australia, led by Chief Isis
Head of the International Organisation Isis led a group of Australian men who were suspected to be planning to take a bomb to the Etihad Airways plane.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in charge of Daddy had also sent the building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the doubts, the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before security checks.
The police won't tell us why the company broke down.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas separation and take the device into full public space, such as the public transport equipment.
The Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever planned in Australia.
Because of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue.
Trump's good side?
Get Mitt Romney to show a healthy sense of wealth
It has already been repeated since Trump's period that the powerful cast-out of voters has also broken down families at everyday level.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper councils gave guidance on how to deal with the family members who voted for Trumpi.
We all want to take a look at this piece of information.
The ability of Trump to combine families has remained with less attention.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a poet from the left-wing spirit in Chicago, who's been against the Republicans of our family for a long time.
He reminded that the common enemy could have a strong interconnective effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins – including the Republican sister with whom he has been arguing for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but, when you think about it, there are significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more terrible possibility that Trump will normalize the real extremism Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I would like to recall Mitt Romney's slow version of madness: dog on the roof of the car, 14 per cent income tax (and at least his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild infractions.
When Trump's season is over, the next presidential candidate in Republicans will only have to be clear, and it will soon seem to be a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to Central Park to the carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best thing New York will get for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of Karusell are huge, mid - middle characters – loose clowns and animals looking back in the horror – and the underlying music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s characteristics become disappointing over time: the views of high buildings begin to exacerbate, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality does not correspond to dreams.
And not yet, after 35 years, it has been completely over that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a major driving circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cotttage, however, is a Swissian pub, but it is not counted.
Instead, there is still a strange magical experience in Central Park – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one 11-year-olds and two 40-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the bearel full points if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week, I was asked to assess my payment experience at the mall, with a scale of five stars before I put my credit card on the reading device.
The same thing in the coffee shop at my home, but there's also an opportunity for me to combine the 15% service money when I go to the coffee bar myself.
This slows everyday interaction and press the customer server to put their person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
When I was tired of giving my credit card to a five-star experience, the valet salesman smiled.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inters.
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's company's representative team for the mission of the coach.
The training responsibility will be taken into account by Fabrizio Piccareta, who has previously been an assistant coach.
Other training groups will continue their current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in the English Sunderland.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Interin Training Group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, President of the FC Inter Government, is sorry about what happened.
Changing the coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the company's leadership confidence, when there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the company's communication.
The Piccarireta agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are already responsible for tomorrow's domestic match against HIFK.
According to the reports of the evening-Sanomies, the team has crashed along Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the company's assistants Piccareta and John Allen were moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccaire were strongly involved in an Inter match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of youth in the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
In Instagram Linda Lampenius published a youth picture.
A number of alarms have been added to the picture, which enables you to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at a camera.
A long time ago, serious, he'll send you a message.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it from here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also spoke about painful subjects.
A fair year ago, he published himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he will be seen 20 years ago, the other he will pose now as the mother of two children.
In his image, Lampenius looks at his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered younger.
It was 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is, I've learned to keep myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to the English hashies of life, eating disorder, uncertain, self-trust, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his previous years of eating.
She was at the hospital when she was 14 years old for anorexia and Ortorex.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which was eventually discovered only in 2006.
The healing began with a little noise.
In addition to therapists and comparisons, Lampenius helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for all the cutbacks on his wrists, which he said he had lost in a cell.
Pustorius was convicted of murder of the accused for the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day as early feelings in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have said that they intend to complain again, for they think Pistorius' six-year sentence is too mild.
The national prosecutor intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with this year.
If a complaint is accepted, the Pustorius judgment may be extended for 15 years.
The death penalty is not available in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the State Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the bTV channel.
The police arrested a group of promised encampmented people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced later that they were released by Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free camping areas and give already well-known fines to all who camp elsewhere than for purpose.
The inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine may be imposed.
Neste's share is sinking - it's already -7.7%
The oil processing plant Nesteen's share has risen by 7.7 per cent about 11 o'clock.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast of Inquiry Financial.
Stock exchange has recently gone on the side of the pack, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Following the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had been increased by 0.2 per cent.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange's overall index OMXH had decreased by 0.3 per cent to 959,48 points after approximately half an hour trade and OMXH25 had reached 0.3 per cent.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate may relieve the irritant intestinal syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
The recent study, however, claims the opposite: a high diet containing meat protein and milk products may facilitate irritant intestinal syndrome.
An acute intestinal syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or blood diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers from Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that enhance the tolerance of the intestine.
According to the head of the study, Marco Colossa, immune cells guarded the mouth and ensure that the harmful microbes in the food do not get into the body.
Infants cause cells to balance cells that enhance tolerance, which protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too close to the inflammation, there may be an irritant intestinal syndrome.
Studies have shown that nostrative immune cells are present in mice with a particular bacteria in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophan so that the immune cells begin to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building materials of proteins.
“We found a connection between the Lactobacillus reuter and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
\"The more the mice had tryptophan in their diet, the more they had such immune cells,
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and a high diet containing tryptophan can enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
When examining the immune cells that confirm tolerance, Professor Luisa Cervantes-Barraga found that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbioma of mice, i.e. to the community of normal bacteria, mushrooms and viruses.
Six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were administered to mice growing in a sterilised environment without intestinal microbim and with no immune cells developed, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in liquids and transferred small amounts of liquid – without bacteria – to mouse isolated non-cypsyps.
Immunocytes developed tolerance for cells that confirm tolerance.
When the active ingredient was recovered from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indoli-3-matic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the treatment of mice, the number of cells that confirm tolerance increased by about 50 %.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same cells that can be tolerated as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the Tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuter bacteria develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, gene errors associated with thyptophan have been observed in patients with acute intestinal syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells, as they regulate inflammation on the intestines of internal surfaces,” says Cervantes-Barraga.
\"The high levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their increased incidence.\"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has received his line-up after a contract with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has received his string-one after a contract with Nemanja Matic. The middle-field player debuted in Manchester United's fight against Sampdory on Wednesday night.
The Mactic, who moved from Chelsea to 40 million pounds, started in Dublin, in the last round before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved in the blue shirt tour of Asia before the beginning of the season, and he was only able at the field for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there is a change before the beginning of the selection period.
He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and thinking make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability, says Mourinho.
\"We will help him to be prepared rather than later...
In addition to Matic, the entrants Victor Lindeloof and Romulu Lukaku were starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cool his starting size for the beginning of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the company has already done a great job, by acquiring three of his four priority players.
“ Three out of four, ” he added.
“I’m more pleased if I get all four, but they did a fine job.
Air balloons bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match for the World Cup in the World Cup directly to Germany in different 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German routine in gambling is high.
Balance their game was in every sector, Finland’s main coach, Tapio Kangasniemi, reported in the release.
In the first two paragraphs, Finland held its opponents at a time, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we were played patiently and in certain places with enough aggression, we were able to play with it, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Pia Korhonen collected 14 points.
The three games in four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges in connection with the Russian meeting of Trump Jr.
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The great jury, which was invited by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer known as the Kreml linkages, Natalia Veselnitskaja.
The news office Reuters, which at the same time reinforces Wall Street Journal’s information on the gathering of a large jury revealed earlier on Thursday.
According to Reuters, the great jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of the Veselnitskaya, known as Trump Jr and the Kreml link, which was held in the middle of the US presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son, the current advisor to the White House, Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called together a large jury in Washington means that the pace of Russian investigation is concentrated.
The sources add that Mueller wanted the great jury to assist in his investigation to investigate Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether the Trump campaign or his immediate circle cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, to send challenges and force people to witness with an oath.
There is a large group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The Grand jury weighs on the evidence provided by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether the prosecution should be brought before it.
The British inventor microchips himself to get home and into his car with a tear of his hand
The British inventor has been the first to microchip himself all over the country so that he can open the outer door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is 33-year-old between Steven Northam's thumb and its front finger, and now it offers services to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their life with the technology of Northamin BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson at the Royal Hampshire Count Hospital in Winchester to meet the medical requirements of the microchip installation.
The microchip uses the same technique as in cats and dogs' microchips, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also turns the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has placed microchip technology in both his home and BMW Z4, which will start when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
Your White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House, the American production event, came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on its way. It was an appeal in the event held at the White House on 17.7.2017, where American building programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials are familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter prepared in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before its landing to the southern lawn floor, an exceptional event, which is reflected in the documents for the HMX-1 helicopter ship.
I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility, the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote an e-mail to his superior, an assistant commander of the Marine Air Force.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17.7.7 p.m. at 7 p.m. and the event would begin in three afternoons.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the departure of a helicopter from the White House would be delayed, another crew would have to be present due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the time of the event, and the security personnel of the unit were with the helicopter when it was in the country.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked for a breach of the law.
“One of our questions was whether this Hatch Act was broken, and we were told not to break, the commander wrote.
It sounds like you can take part. The assistant commander answered.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political tone.
At that time, the President spoke on behalf of the Senate health reform and on the smoother state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their trips.
but their use is unusual for photographs only.
Trump's actions raised attention in February when Air Force One was running the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has been strongly critical of the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products produced by American workers from all 50 states,” said the White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House with the accuracy of centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exercises for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
On that day, helicopters of the unit were also scheduled for 11 hours in non-precise support tasks.
According to the White House, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's informant told me that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have accounts of flights related to the President's duties, and the exact assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defence 2017 hourly compensation for VH-3D Helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico state to the White House and spent an hour back.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
“The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading, ” says Walters.
\"The level of compensation required includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called \"excessed costs\", which are taken into account in annual appropriations,
According to the report by the RAND Research Company in 2015, the level of compensation does not include personnel costs but takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former Secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
\"It's time to introduce American production.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and, through it, employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is absolutely appropriate to bring it forward:
It's not sure if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he was sitting in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky boat.
I know Sikorsky very well, the President said.

The state prosecutor of Venezuela calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country from being appointed.
The state prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday's vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative was elected to the country, which, among other things, could change the Constitution of the country.
According to D.A. Luisa Ortega, the decision to stop has been requested for election polls.
Ortega has also started the vote on electoral research.
He appointed two judges to the task after the British company holding a representative vote reported that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the Allies of Maduro were in terms of representation, and the elected 545 representative body has, among other things, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the representative may break down the Congress led by the opposition and amend the laws.
Maduro as a described dictator
The actions of the Maduron have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the Constitution to be a way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, in turn, announced that they do not recognise the new representativeship.
Maduro claims that the new representative group is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, restlessness has continued for months.
They have wounded many people and over 100 people are dead.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis after the oil price dropped.
Now many people can't afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to show its opinion on Friday, when the new representative is to begin.
The Russian man who gave up Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
At the Minneapolis court in the United States, Max Senah, 41 years of age, sentenced him to four years of imprisonment as part of a worldwide computer therapy.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland gave Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, says AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of a computer plague that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be expelled from the country after the sentence of imprisonment.
After the arrest, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly strung Finland and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing it in advance.
According to the D.A., Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which was infected with tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish user names and passwords.
After that, the bombers used data by continuing to direct Internet traffic, which led to clinking and distribution of spam.
According to Director Kenneth Blanco of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other active cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press release.
Amended at 20.58: Corrected name of the convicted person by littering.

The threat of flooding by certain tourists to the culture of the region
Public authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, local anger is directed at cruise ships in the form of tourism.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it \"hot and flee\" tourism: only a few hours are available and there are visits in large groups.
Venetian is a threat to the city’s quick day trips.
It is difficult to move on the streets, and the fine openings are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further from an historic center, while hotels have arrived in their place.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Public authorities are considering restrictions on tourist quantities.
They call the current phenomenon bad-quality tourism - low-quity toursm.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
You follow the guide on the Piazzale Romasta Rialton Bridge and St Markus Square, and you turn back, describes the tourism and tourism that is prevailing and problematic by the Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of places, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the city's identity.
The St. Mark’s office is also part of the most popular visits to the historic centre of Venice.
The church of St. Mark is located on the side of the tower.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
At the historic center of Venice, 50 000 locals live.
In 1951, the population was about 175 000.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Russians showed their views against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this goes on, there will be no tourists in Venice in a few years.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says the demonstration was organized by Carlo Belframe.
It is difficult for ships to bring to Venice the income they need and create the need for many jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is that cruisers go beyond the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, is sure to change the situation if Veneto's administrative area, where Venetian is located, would have more power to decide on his own matters - unless it is fully autonomous.
In Venice, some 20-30 million tourists visit each year.

I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curse of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of himself, among other things, in Grand Canyon's men.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian athlete, has risen to his current home country in Norway, not least because in March, he broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record of 400 metres running around the wheel cycle 51.81.
A month later, he healed the 400 - foot [400 m] of adjujuice in Norway at the record of 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who is using a hard social media, noticed that fame and publicity have a shadow.
The men around the world began to send pictures of their sex organs to Iuel in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close off his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of fracture photos from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel did not want the VG interview to identify exactly what pictures he received.
You can guess, Iuel.
It's nice to get some feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother's a Danish, father of Danish-norman.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved first to Namibia because of her father's work, then to Pakistan.
After that, they were in Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained by three trainers, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussing than the United States.
In the United States, trainers don't ask any questions. They're just giving orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be in personal contact with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record at 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence train.
I'm walking down the road, Janne Korve's entire career, and now he's in the World Cup: \"I don't know what's going on.
It's been nice to count when it's never happened!
Janne Korpi, who reads the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has again been able to enjoy his beloved species.
Last summer, the career continued at stake.
The weight loss of the table had forced Korve to operate in January, and he did not want to get better.
The hand had taken a hit in the race, too.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was gonna do, whether or not I'm going to go onboard.
The sponsors were missing and many things opened, Korpi says.
But that's what they say.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began again to draw on the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, \"Oh, fuck, yes, this is so much fun, we're gonna have a couple more.\"
It was only in September-October that the basket was able to calculate properly, but after a long landing period, it's been a big deal.
There's only a few of Korpi's going around.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the boarding to Korvele.
I've never fallen for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi is climbing the Spanish Bay of the World Cup of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Even though individual races do not like him on board, in hard association, he will always get on fire.
According to the ear, the evaluation of the international skiing union competitions has increased over the past few years, even though some platers chose Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is big.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-year team of Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The team's droops, the 17-year-old Rene Rinne fabric and Emmi Parkkisenniemi are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow the way young friends go.
I remember when I myself was at the time that everything was new and was so sick about everything.
It'll bring a new power, too, Korppi will think.
There's still something on the front line, but, by the way, no, that's the amount of power in my friends!
In the background of the boarding career Janne Korpi has built another kind of sports career.
The son of the director-in-law, Pega Korve, has been involved in medical sports: the director has his own medical horses for whom he does training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the results of the treatment and usually something from the beginning, Korpi tells me.
Treatment management and therapeutic training are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the plateau career is completed.
I don't really plan that far, but it's probably an option.
I'm going to experience it just as much as I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep my time nervous and develop, maybe in the summer, I'm going to drive something out.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already inside the species.
The treatment cases also include the Elitloppet sickness insurance with Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruise ship headed to the Stockholm Elitloppet restaurant at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
Robbery has gone into a very commercial business, and people have been excited.
Now we're at the point where there's no bankruptcy at least.
There's still time for a few months, hoping to get the ship full, Korpi says he's excited.
I'm surprised that Kite has all been caught up in the courthouse project.
Intendo Esther is the name of a new, 41-year-old care home built for Kite.
The building of an over 1 700 floor sub-haulometer will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighboring health area.
The subject of a general wonder is where customers are enough for the new treatment unit, for now during Siu’s wars many private nursing homes are picking up a customer seat.
Anne Flink Totendo, Director of Health Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for enhanced housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Intendo bought private nursing homes from Kite in Kanervikkola and Eerika last year.
The trade concerned business, but there is a five-year lease on real estate.
Flint says that Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these areas.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation of the long-term commitment to production by McVitie's engineer manufacturers at the Glasgow plant.
According to the GMB section of the UK General Trade Union, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees at Hobnobs and Rich Tea factories and other products.
The Pladis company owned by McVitie's brand reported that he invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will certainly be the first to be replaced if there are any changes to the business.
In its letter to the CEO, GMB urges the company to respond to the concern that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines.
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, considers it very worrying that the factory manager will not be able to find out about the business needs of Tollcross and future investment plans.
“Perheet has worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused strongly on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income and Brexit, rising cost of living and continuous reduction of production, the Eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production.
According to the distributor on the planet, the factory manager had received a letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company is directly responsible for the letter because it appreciates a continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB at Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with workers, among other very competitive and uncertain market companies, among other things, we assess all of our business activities and operate constantly in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the notifier, in recent years the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in Tollcross’s factory, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
“We are aware of the long history of Tollcross and are sure to be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant’s activities.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's target after the end of the EUR 189 million transfer agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational transfer is the most mentioned case in the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of migrants. The previous record was less than half the smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United at 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best hired professional athlete, as PSG will offer him more than 500 000 pounds per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be upset about the activities of PSG and the way Neymar has left the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that Neymar has been taking very good care of since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players in PSG.
- I'm not worried, because they know that if they take our players, we'll be their opponents and we'll contact their players, Al-Khelaifi said.
- We're honoring all the clubs.
But if they bother our players, they'll have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of just this: it expressed its interest in the PSG average field player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances. It might well be that Barcelona loses its star player, Neymar.

NYT: Trump's hot calls were invented by the White House informant: \"I wouldn't say it was a lie.
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, says New York Times.
The calls made by Trump with both the Mexican president and the director of the Party Organization have proved to have been invented.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the patrols spoke to Trump personally, and Trump, with the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, had discussed at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty bad accusation.
These discussions happened, not just on the phone, but on the face of Sanders.
The speech to the Boy Scouts raised evil
On Monday, Trump told me that the Mexican president called him and thanked Trump for his successful illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that a few more will cross the border in Mexico because they know the journey is going to be on the US border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a notice saying that this call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In that case Trump expressed his speech at a large meeting of the National Coast Guard in West Virginia.
I got a call from the warden, and he said it was the best speech that's ever been held to them.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the CSO informed me that it was not aware of the call made by any of its executives to Trump.
According to the press, a previous statement by the director of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologized to Trump for his speech from the partyers, speaks his side.
The Trump's speech at the convention on the part of the Armenian organization raised a great deal of weirdness, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, expressed the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
