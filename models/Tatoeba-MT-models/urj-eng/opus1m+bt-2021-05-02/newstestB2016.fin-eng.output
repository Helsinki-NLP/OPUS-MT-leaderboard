The Opposition Party immediately called for a distinction - the President gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech that he had spoken about a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again held the same speech in Parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not seem to have the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, who was 91, was in full power of life.
The MDC requested Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants urged to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.

Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, will assess the request.

According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of the ministers of the Interior.
The professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University, in an emergency call, asked a little bit of a shaker police home and told me that he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact information of a dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
In the house, the police found a hand-written message on Amy Prentiss' body and white paper: “I’m very sorry, and I hope I can cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me, in Lamb’s signature, read the authorities.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus, and the police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor in his working room who had been killed by his workroom, who had been shot by Lamb.
The Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university's authorities received information about shooting at 10.18 in the morning.
She said that Lamb called a fatal emergency for a while after this.
The day was another death incident, and Lamb took off his life when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teaching staff stayed behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers examined the details in both places, and the Lamb knew taught about the man, and the researchers were born with a picture of a gifted but perhaps a problem teacher.
The students always said that they were looking forward to the professor's lessons.
According to Gautier, the Prentis death police, the professor did not have a prior violent or criminal record.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in Lamb’s book, which had given recognition to the “human people, ” with whom he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 members of the educational staff. Many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
However, there were some references to the problems.
The student named Lamb, Brandon Beavers, told me that the professor seemed tense and nervous, as if he had something wrong.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about the stress of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration policy meant that the claim that Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the assistant professor's office.
Professor William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After he left the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before reaching Lamb, the police had taken off their lives with a 38-caliper pistol in the backyard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a half-mile away from his parents' home, Methel Johnson, Washington County Killer.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a geography and educational teacher at a university with 3 500 students. In the city there were 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's most long-term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he met with Lamb's friends when he was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old.
She was still friends in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar for years.
“Lamb was a real heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls were with him on medical leave, told Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no document says they're not married.
The couple had a dog called Lightning, and they lived in a brickhouse in Gautier's little town.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
The ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
He was very shocked, O'Steen said about his daughter.
“Tytary and mother were the best friends...
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that she liked music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared in both summer events three years ago.
Later, they used to play together.
O'Steen says his daughter's writing and playing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barmaid and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, told me that he had seen Lamb and Prentis on September 5, when Lamb had called the guitar and the lips for a rare audience.
Nothing said that something was wrong.
A happy couple, Shaffer said.
We were together.
They both had a good sense of humor.
“The professor Schmidt, who received his death, directed the first year’s seminars and specializes in the history of Indians and migrant times,” said Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
She was married, and she had three small children.
He studied at Emphoria State University in Kansas and was Chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people met at a memorial meeting in the candlelight.
The Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night event where the university choir presented the songs \"Bright Morning Star\" and \"Amazing Grace\"
The teaching goes on Wednesday.
We're trying to get the students back, LaForge said.
\"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to Mississippi about Cleveland.
Assistant suppliers: Associated Press suppliers of Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi in Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, for the police are now telling us that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that, although Lamb referred to the emergency call as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to employ as much seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is providing his current employees and seasonal workers with the opportunity for further knowledge of work.

UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to nearly five years of conflict and that the weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Banan announced its intention to meet five permanent Member States of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would later be in contact with the United Nations General Assembly in this month.
Ban regretted the fact that the dispersal of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional authorities has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iran Nuclear Convention.
Chapter 8 of the suffering test: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trumpia has been tried to be an empty cleaner.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some of them predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican circles have had the results of every effort to pull Trump down the Gallippo leader.
Ten national gallupes will show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it says about the options of the real estate engine.
But the elections are only in the early stages.
There's not yet any announcement that Trump will be elected candidate for Republicans.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who had been in the gallup tip of 2011, was able to give room to ascending Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would be difficult in the general election.
External groupings such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC as well as the economic conservative Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and started digging to cover him.
The following recent gallup data show that the real estate module cannot be ignored with the shoulder drive:
There's been a full rule in Trump's favour.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, according to the Gallup of Monmouth, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate.
By mid-July, 40% were already positive.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six of the ten Republicans are a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also seen in the states where the elections are held first.
In the last week's Quinni Market Galllup 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidateship.
At the CNN and ORC gallup last week, 67% of Republicans expressed their satisfaction or satisfaction with the possible choice of Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's candidateship.
Ben Carson will make almost as eager a reception as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidateship and 40% of Trump's candidateship).
Who's next the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding support rate of 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be unsatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush was elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament problematic.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for the volume and offensive comments. 52 per cent of Republican supporters across the country regard the properties of the real estate module as suitable for the President.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the first meeting will be held: according to the Quinni Market Gallup, 52 per cent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities as suitable for the Chief of Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post's gallup, 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament incompatible with the White House.
Republicans are starting to get used to it.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When I ask the Republicans who are most likely to be the candidate for the party, according to CNN and ORC, four out of ten believe Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since the middle of July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in place before.
At this stage, the last four ten Republicans considered Rick Perry to be a likely candidate, and only 28 per cent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think the Trump campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans supported another candidate, Trump will cover almost all other candidates.
Some experts consider that the divided camp is likely to benefit from Trump when the opponents of Trump are divided into beneficiaries of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University's opinion survey revealed that, in an imaginary double fight between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would have a greater support force on his side almost always.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's on levels.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory out of Trump 19 points apart from the imaginary twin fight.
A small majority of Trump's supporters are already saying that they have taken a vote.
According to the gallup published on Tuesday by CBS and NOT, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure to vote.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment, a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's great rival at this moment is neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates will vote twice more likely for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans are united with Trump's view of migration.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump two months ago, migrant rapists from Mexico have been a hot topic in 2016.
Part of it is concerned that Trump's volume-oriented speeches are exterminated by important Latin American voters from Republicans and hinder brand reform.
However, according to ABC News and Washington Post's opinion polls published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump.
As long as the migration is in the light, it's Donald Trump.
Irrespectiveness towards administration is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting around half of the Republicans' votes. Please make a significant contribution to the fact that both of them have become outside the terms.
ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion poll says this was about six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also a pain in Washington.
According to the opinion study by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the brink of rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question hour
After the election, Corbyn's first performance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been looking forward to
The Labour Party of Labour's new screening, Jeremy Corbyn, is to rise first to ignore its forces at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corby's first six questions after a little bit of a day.
Corby has called less theater and adds facts to the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corby's first parliamentary test is being carried out at the meeting of Corbyn, after the meeting of the shadow government and the speech of the Corbyn trade union central organisation at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence the national song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War in Tuesday has been a critical part of a number of Tory parties, and the silence has also ended with the headlines of several newspapers.
The silence of Corbyn during the national song attracted attention.
The representative of Corbyn stated that Corbyn stood up during the national song, in silence respecting the loyalty of the royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a shadow government member of Corbyn, told us in the BBC Two's Newsnight programme, that he would have called upon the party's leader to join the national song despite the opposition of this monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's number twos, calling on differences in economic, defence and external affairs.
Ms Robin Brant, a correspondent in BBC's policy, considers that political differences between the EU membership of Great Britain and the conditions for the granting of benefits to the government have taken place in the Labour Party following the appointment of Corbyn.
At the TEC meeting, Corbyn said that Labour intends to propose changes to eliminate the restrictions in full.
A few hours later, Minister Smith of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government said that the party's position was very clear: it only opposes government plans to fall from 26 000 to 23 000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader, met by David Cameron during the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
A new approach, promised by the Labour Director, says that he has chosen questions for Cameron from the public on 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, who was elected from the Northern Electoral District, the Question Time has too much coordination, and he promises to avoid nomadic speech and licensing and, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow minister Angela Eagle will be bringing him in interviews, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corby has also given the idea that others could also be put to the vote at times, and he will tell us that he has discussed this with John Bercowin, the President of this House.
On the rise of Corbyn in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a doll theater policy that was often linked to Question Time, but years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since the first hour of survey television was held in 1990, it has been regarded as a central measure of the director's judgment, the management of the sub-room and the position, but according to the critics, the survey has become a calariy who needs substantial reforms.
‘Shot in Joburg-: homeless young photographers

The group of former streetmen has found a meaningful way to learn and make money.
“I was shot in Joburg – is an unprofitable description studio where homeless young people are taught to take photos of their home and earn at the same time.

Pound is strengthened when Britain's wages rise
On the rise of wages and salaries in Great Britain, the SABMiller drew up the FTSE 100 index.
In May to July, wages in Great Britain rose by 2.9 per cent from the corresponding period last year.
The accelerated growth rate was fastest since 2009.
The price was increased by 1% and recorded at USD 1,5505 and the price increased also in relation to the euro and was quoted at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose price pain was 20% when the company received the initial purchase offer from AB InBev, a competing company.
When it comes to trade, the two largest brewery companies in the world would be combined with brands under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the competing Richemont Group’s positive result, focusing on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. Sales development was also the result of the increase in the Burberry key market in China.
The Glencore stock rose by 5 per cent of its declared plans to collect 2.5 billion dollars as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the pack and paper group Mond were the largest fall of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's stock prices for sales.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to GBP 46,6 million.
Bomb JD Sports: higher wage expenditure could be detrimental to enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, the president of the JD Sports Management Group, the increase in the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the company.
It is clear from the fact that the increase in labour costs can jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash lanzeeras the grass root campaign against Aldi's belt
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA store from Ald's power in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against the $700 million invasion of Australia.
Aldi intends to open up two distribution centres and the first up to 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-suppermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in power and social media and organise events such as Adelaide-show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory Simmo in Dunsborough offers taste in IGA stores, and traders sell ticket tickets to customers at the discount price for football games in South Australia.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade team organises an annual investment strategy day.
It is a significant market, as South and West Australia accounts for almost 30 % of Metcash's IGA sales footprint, and in these areas the coverage is higher than the IGA sales network of the Eastern States.
Southern and Western Australian consumers are known for their periphery, and IGA traders in the region have a significantly higher market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland. The market share in South Australia is 30 % and 24 % in Western Australia, whereas the eastern states account for only 14 %.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which will be sold by all operators, but in particular by independent operators.
This week Morgan Stanley Analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sale of IGA dealers could be 360 million and Metcash's sales would be $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
The report is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and in these regions will be up to USD 500 million and USD 600 million.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of sales and volume of food can mean a loss of $113 million in the result before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast will lose market share in the Eastern States, mainly for Ald and Coles, although according to the recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's clients are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group's leading portfolio manager, Hamish Douglass, told us that it was very likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that Metcash's board member contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's food business business, serving 1200 IGA, has decreased by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesaler goes counter-measures and makes over $150 million an annual rainfall in Australia to meet Coles and Wolworth's prices for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the renewal of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the choice of food for their brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price revision and sales reform plans are at a good pace, and the company is able to raise its profits in 2017 for the first four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanas from Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his conduct rather than the criticism of a special man.
According to Steve Healy, the president of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the victim of the recent Nick Kyrgios jujus, who deserves a special mention rather than criticism.
“The two younger parties named Special K- duo, Kokkinakis, became unsatisfied as the evil boy Kyrgios provocated his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, in the Cartoning between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, Cincinnati, the judge had to separate his competitors twice.
In the US open Kokkinakis, he was frustrated in the field of the Mayan, when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the second-time single-player Bernard Tomic behind Davis Cup in the semifinal against Great Britain.
“I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn to his dispute, ” Healy said.
He broke the bat when he broke the match in the US open, and he's not the first player to break his mail because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not proud to do it.
However, he has been very good at the provocating use of Harrison in the United States, for example, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and completes a very team. He has never had problems with other players, and he's being respected amongst players. He practices hard, is in good condition and a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated based on his own medals.
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the important round of the Australian team as perjaminator. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties, but he is in favour of returning the Canberra tumour to the team for long-term confirmation.
First of all, we want to focus fully on the fights in Kyrgios instead of all the genders, Healy said.
Nick has gone up fast, and as Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man is going to have to grow up in the light of publicity, and he deserves to be critical of his bad mistakes, but we are still trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to arrange his own peace for him.
The European migrant crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, who declared the emergency, closed its southern border in Serbia on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants, aimed at preventing the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, when hundreds of migrants collapseed into a non-kennel country, and the Serbian authorities responded fiercely.
People who fled from violence had to stay on the road between country inspection stations for an indeterminate period of time
Decompression began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter fly above the migrants, these hurried, open the border, and shouted insults to Hungarian melkapolis.
Some became Protestants to eat and drink.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as further arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation must be discussed in Brussels and also in other countries in the next few days, Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
At the border between Hungary and Serbia, the day later began when the 28 national groupings failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility of 40 000 asylum seekers' interpreters in Italy and Greece was shared. The meeting raised the hope that an agreement would be reached next month or at the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
In Tuesday, German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope to take urgent steps in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions could use more effective means, i.e. closing you and speeding up legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire to the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migrants from that point of view, now that Serbia's border is already ready to help.
The CBS News correspondent, Charlie D'Aga, reported that even the prisoners took part in the invitation to tender for the finalisation of the PIM between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottle and transit point for migrants into the European Union, and many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that most of the people arriving are living-level refugees, not those who have the right to seek security, but also those of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at half-night, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, and it also defines longer prisoners for convicted human traffickers.
“As a result of the mass migration situation, the government announces a crisis situation in the country,” said the government informant Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
We follow a tight line: illegal crossing is a crime.
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military measures that are expected next week. For several days, suppliers of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs at the border.
Gyorgy Bakkosi, an adviser for internal security in Orban, reported that the authorities have taken 45 border crossings to try immediately at the border and 15 further.
The people who cross the border are now in possession of the police, accused of crimes based on new laws.
The authorities are quick to fix the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday.
Kaaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal bag at a point of contact where people packed up.
About 20 fit in, but thousands left behind.
Another migrant group was blocking the main gap between Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were in the eating and drinking cave until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders by national gallupe
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton is still double-numbered as the national presidential candidate for the democratics, but Senator Bernie Sanders has exhausted the distance.
Clinton's support is now 47% of the votes of the Democrats (down from 58%) when Sanders is in favour of 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the democratic people is 15%.
More than five months before the pre-elections for most of the Democrats, it is too early to tell who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice for other candidates.
After a galup last month, CBS News, Clinton has lost support from several democratic groups, whereas there have been new supporters involved in the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a solid leadership amongst women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's suffering among men has fallen significantly, and he only has a 5 % needle in Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among democracy under the age of 50, and now he's at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
In the last month, Clinton's first trip to support shares in Sanders among the liberals was two-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-piece neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to announce their support for Clinton if he is elected as a candidate for the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with the smallest reservations, and 15% would only support him because he was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly eager to be a candidate if he was elected a candidate.
There is more fragmentation among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton, only about a quarter would support him with zeal.
In turn, 48% of the Democrats would support Clinton. Only 35% of Republican voters would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s voters are freely asked to describe why they support their proposals, the most popular justification is Clinton’s right experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose a female president (13%) and third, the fact that Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
In addition, there is a mention of common views and the opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President is still weighing on his possible proposal, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to join the contest, and a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When I ask the Democrats for the second most popular candidate as a party candidate, the majority will choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate and significantly more popular candidate after Clinton.
If Biden does not go to the democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his way forward in front of Sanders, while Sanders will be in the first 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not go to the contest.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, who is second, is far from Clinton, but more believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual elections.
Democrat voters, however, consider the views on issues of greater importance to candidates' profits.
The voters do not regard any democratic candidates or potential candidates as acceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and executive types.
Biden is often described as honest, while Clinton is often regarded as the leading type.
Up to 30% of the Democrats do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while Sanders are 15 per cent. 27 per cent cannot say whether Sanders is honest.
Democrat voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideaology of voters.
About a quarter of all characteristics have no opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked for views on the private e-mail of Hillary Clinton and the use of their own servers as Foreign Minister, the majority of democratic voters say they are pleased with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed the idea of Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only a third of them are satisfied.
The opinion of the people was divided in March, when the conflict had just become public.
The majority of Americans believe that the contested use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% says that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this, 36 percent is the majority, six out of ten, there are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, it is possible to improve these qualities by asking for the views of all voters: Clinton considers that it is only 32% more honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than in the last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered more reliable.
The majority consider Sanders to be honest, but just as with Carson, many people have no Sanders opinion.
The survey sample is 351 voters and the survey error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is going to hang on to Donald Trump's first trip to the national suffering trap
According to CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates doubled over half of the votes in a new survey and left other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The benefit rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey, which was conducted before Fox News last month.
However, Carson’s support was ambitious in the same period, ranging from 6 % to 23 %.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all population groups.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich stay far away. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is weaker and has fallen from 10% last month to 2%.
The former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida shared a third place with a support of 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent in the direction or in the second.
According to the latest survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising and 19% of Republicans are in favour of Trump's support.
In the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also clearly led by Carson before.
In the last week's encounter with men, Trump set out extraordinary charges for the retired neurosurgery, but Carson, however, apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
\"We need energy,\" Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of the Baruch College Fuss.
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the community ritual in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, five people are charged with murder charges.
The members of the Department of Pi Delta Psi, Baruch College of New York, were brutally assaulted at the castors of Chun-Michael-Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had been set up with almost 15 kilos of sand and his assault had been repeated in his attempt to reach an object placed on the other side of the rigid field.
Deng is first told by his choice of headache, and then he lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the P.D.A.P.P.A. didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they're supposed to have waited an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
The Commissioner, Chris Wabner, at the press conference, told me that however, Members were able to change the clothes of Deng, goglat his symptoms and contact Andy Mengi, the president of the department.
At this stage, Members began to hide the tools, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health, said Wagner.
Deng wasn't recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been beaten several times in the head, upstairs body, and I traveled with a boring object.
“A lot of families have had to be shocked by the simulation of the department, as at least one student per year has died as a result of a simulation since 1970, ” says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The departments and their members must be responsible for taking an important step.
The great jury in Monroe County presented five members of the department to be charged with the murder of the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with simulation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to be responsible not only for individuals, but also for an organisation officially or informally approved, ” Wagner announced at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College placed an operating ban on the department, and the national department resigned from the operation of the local department.
This is how the increase in interest rates of the Central Bank of the United States (Fedin) affects
The rise in interest rates and the increase in the stock market were acidified, the return on securities is rising and the economy slips down.
That's what we know.
We do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
In particular, with regard to the economy, we find history as an indication of timing.
It has reached up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, although not always. The determining factor is how economic and financial assets react.
This is why central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention when the increase in interest rates begins, but how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators may notice that all interest-in-interest increases may be over-excited.
“The first rise of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly interpreted as often as a sign of the end of bad money,” said Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics chief global economist to his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a scary standing shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there is no impact.
Examples based on these historical trends of how the effects can be seen in different economic areas:
As has already been seen on the market for about a month, the retention of interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When the interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
‘The trend would appear to be the continuation of interest rates on capital after the first increase for a period of 12 to 24 months, which may once again reflect a delay in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank analyst noted the recent increase in interest rates in the study.
In the last 35 years, the market is generally seen at a sharp increase in interest rates, about 14 per cent, relatively flat for the next 250 days (mean increase 2.6 per cent), and after 500 days, the situation normalised, and the average interest rate yield after six shares is 14,4 per cent, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Ascend Management Chiefquity of Strategy Barron's.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is generally slightly later on cycle and interest income are beginning to decrease.
The depression is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates tends to work on it in general.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that were not previously in existence and could speed up the downward trend.
It is particularly noteworthy that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever due to the increase in the central bank’s governance interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, an increase of 118 steering rates then in 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to be sustainable, and in the third quarter, 1.5 per cent, the regional central bank of Atlanta says.
In the event of an increase in interest rates such a sensitive economic situation can be a risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to this week's Open Market Committee (Federal Market Committee) meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economists believe that, although the open market committee would accept a lift at this meeting, the future trade appears to be just a 25% probability.
“In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles until now have been in supercycle, which also shows a very rapid rise in GDP before the landing point, after the rise of the increase.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst sheep in the Verroca season.
The cycle is clearly the longest one the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession, and the record had been 35 months, now it is going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market’s past interest rates, and the formula also repeats on the capital side.
The difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in shares when the central bank changes the course.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first rise/calculation cycle starts.
At the end of the pick-up cycle, income will drop immediately, Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that the interest rate will make long and short-term bonds approach to each other and level up.
“Collected bonds are often better off in such a environment, although we are still cautious about returns,” said Ms. Kathy Jones, an analyst for fixed-income securities.
I find it fascinating, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future trend of the central bank.
\"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of tighter adjustment of financial policy,\" Jones says.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the rate of return is direct, the credit risk margins are enlarged and the volatility has increased.
In broad terms, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit because the interest rate is falling and local products are beginning to attract.
The prospects of the debt-bearing multinationals are weaker because the strengthening dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and increase debt.
“The list shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months, the Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Enterprises with strong balance sheet levels over the period 1994, 1999 and 2004 reached an average of five percentage points.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility also improved their quality, on average 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points better, respectively.
It's a big question.
Businesses with a significant share of variable interest will lose most, Goldman said.
Consumers outside the stock market generally benefit from strengthening the dollar.
Sparers also benefit from higher income, although experts disagree about how quickly the effects are seen.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a classic FM copy
Conservator Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for over popularisation.
According to Bingham, today it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitors.
It also claims that the BBC Music Awards award is only a copy of the British galaxy.
Mr Collins, on the other hand, blames the Voice channel for inhumanity.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually turns into a copy of the Classic FM channel, and the accusations increase the pressure on the station to prove that each of the other commercial radio stations will be offered.
Conservator Andrew Bingham also informed the BBC's leadership that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populist and that the channel is no longer a distinction between its commercial competitors.
\"I would not like to talk about populism, but Radio 3 seems to be moving towards the Classic FM channel,\" Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Award, held last December, also receives criticism from Bingham:
“The first BBC Music Awards held in the year last year affects the British Prize Award copy.
These two examples are that instead of new and different ones, only what is already on the market, Bingham notes.
The President of the BBC denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 had a commercial competitor with significantly more live music and selective content.
“Radio 3, I learned from classic music that I can’t learn from other channels.
The commitment of the Channel to live music and music is entirely in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and order new works, said the President.
Earlier this year, the leader of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the station had to work harder to maintain public interest, because British people know classical music better.
However, radio 3 is not the only critical of entering the commercial channels in the consultation of the BBC channel, the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
The Toy Party Parliamentary Secretary Damien Collins criticised the \"The Voice\" competition, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer, Talpa Media, which is estimated at 22 million pounds.
\"It is not just a debate on the programme, as it is not unique or particularly distinguishing:
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which, as stars, was produced by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way to BBC.
In addition, Collins called on the company to look for a slow program on its own account when it next launched a new series of entertainment.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online trade in all time in August – perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of online commerce have been statistics since 2000. Last month growth was slowest in all time.
Three years ago, the online trade was strengthened by mobile shopping.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can control shopping wishes.
For more than ten years, the takeover of the online trade has helped many of Britain's purchasing wars.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is on the line, and new sales figures show an increase of only 7% over the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slow throughout the whole period when online sales have been statistics, i.e. since 2000, and last year the net sales grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is on the line, and new sales figures show an increase of only 7% over the first three months of 2015.
“If the growth of the last year is compared with the figures in 2000, it is clear that growth will be adjusted over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of IRG, Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile services.
“There were more and more to buy from the network, and it was possible to buy for many in different environments, even though it was a domestic threat.
With more moderate mobile mobility now, growth can improve,
The black Friday coming from America is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for the slowing down of growth.
According to experts, the theme day to be spent on the last Friday of November can allow consumers to postpone the purchase decision before Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal, led many traders to fall web sites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which allows consumers to push after offers, can control purchasing desires during the rest of the day.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of shoppers.
In the field, nostril accidents are buried in the responsibility of the victims, the Bin Laden family.
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the major construction company Saudi Bingo Group is involved in an accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims of a crane falling on Mekka's Great Sprinkler.
The streets had met a number of white-dressed people to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The devastation occurred at a holy place where the fallout was only a day before the house of a Moscower infiltrated through the walls of the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia requires Bin Laden's family company to be responsible for an accident involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims were transported on the streets in the Mekka's Great Smurfiant accident.
Among the fallen dead, Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mekka with his first sacrament.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Keeper, who were about to start their annual career holiday trip.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that the outbreak will be held when thousands of people are currently entering the city for the purpose of the temple.
According to King Salman, Binlad's Group should not have left up a crane's boom when no crane was used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binlad Group is involved in an accident.
The English service of the news office did not report this in detail. However, according to the English version, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the court of the Great Smurf. Thousands of Muslims are headed for the Great Sprinkler's dispersion later this month.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice of nostril accident and the Group's representatives have not been targeted for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of not complying with the current safety provisions and cooperated with meteorology experts.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by Mekka's Suurmoskija as part of the huge building project by Binlad Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close links with the reigning family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several important construction projects.
Al Qaidan’s senior leader Osama bin Laden was a cave boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
A nostril accident occurred just a few days before the sanctification of Mekko, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rice (EUR 250 000) to be paid to the victims’ families and permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q bomb, there is a cheap Eastern European labour force behind the phenomenon.
The British hire generals at home more and more, says Veronique Laury.
The Finnish people who come from Eastern Europe have increased their skills, working as professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for employees will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Main Letter, Daily Mail
The British are said to move home hammering and painting practices to the people who come from Eastern Europe.
Ironing and painting skills seem to be rare these days.
The British are now increasingly employing home generals to carry out home narrations, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfishher, who owns the chain of the sale of home supplies. According to Laury, professional workers from Eastern Europe are at high prices.
As a result of this report, Kingfisher intends to open up 200 new Screwfix stores for business operators, while 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more female cancer for B&Q sales, for eight out of ten shopping decisions make a woman.
At the moment, most of the personnel are men.
According to Laury, it is important to take into account the demographic trends, since today, more and more women living alone are also refurbishing their homes.
“The staff of our sales are still mostly men, ” says Laury.
We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process:
Laury is one of the five women who are at the end of the companies of the British FTSE 100 index, and he has also reorganized the company's management group so that men and women leaders are equal.
Kingfishher is almost the only quality, since 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the CEO and the financial director.
This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important issue for us, so Laury told me.
\"It has not been difficult to find good women in the Group of Directors,
Kingfisher's half-year operating profit and sales figures are down even though the company had the most rare work to do after the withdrawal of sales.
Kingfisher is in line with the current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open up 200 new stores.
The three acet government decided to resort to mandatory legislation in order to save the country's economy.
Even visible effects were quickly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to force the same route and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people feel that reason is at that time.
Let's see if it's worth a break when it goes bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already come to announce that you are not going to participate in the expression of mind but go to work.
This would have been impossible in the good old consensus period.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring as a rich person would have been a small person's political suicide.
Millions of members of trade unions, a few tens of thousands of people, do not have much time, but it gives the reason for thinking.
The position of trade union is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From an interest in the Ay movement, the government's poor solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to roll with their own weight, it is now at last in the Treaties to get to the point, namely the rights of the worker to defend, appear and properly.
Thus, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the union is perhaps more necessary.
Whether we think about the activities of the organisations or not, it is dust that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been down for 31 months consecutively.
Gross domestic product is still falling, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduced staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta begins a savings study with the aim of getting costs out of total EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings university, the University will start the entire staff-to-work y negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be sought to save other activities.
As a result of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It also affects the government's cut-offs.
During this accounting period, the university will produce some 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but the same funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total university budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass education and research cuts and the reduction of corporate financing with our university is very important, says Principal Anneli at the University of Pauli's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the additional funding reduction appears to be in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, soutter says.
Rail transport is supposed to be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is in line with the local transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-range traffic going on after the short-range traffic.
Soutter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, Onnibus's plans are welcomed.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
United States central bank interest rate decision time
The whole world will be following the US Central Bank Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on the possible increase in interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the economies, which, last week, still believed the central bank would raise interest rates, are now cutting the central bank's remaining interest rate at the current range of 0 to 0,25 %, which is evident by Reuters' 80 economic scientists from asking questions.
“It has a historical situation, since the central bank has held the interest rate to be close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates at zero level and therefore initiate normalisation of interest rates, told the Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior researcher Angel Ubide.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of extra dollars into the balance sheet and has only accelerated inflation slightly.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation which is not as rose.
It has called on the market to make provision for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.

Delta State University shooter left an apology form.
After firing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hopes to be able to cancel it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
At the Mississippi Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m. in the morning.
Monday, and he told me he shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to come home in an emergency call.
I shot my wife last night, Lamb told me, and she also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that had no harm to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the site and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by both Lamb's hands, saying: “I am very sorry, and I hope I can cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
After Lamb wrote a message, he drove 500 miles away from Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of history before he took off his life late on Monday, when the police reached him.
Professor William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt as well. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triiodrama.
Shawn O'Ste, who was married for seven years, described his former wife as a human.
The couple had resigned 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter, who is shocked.
According to a man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Heraldi, a close friend of the Prentiss, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentis worked online from home by hand.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
He always wanted to help others.
According to the police, Lamb had called the relatives during Monday night and told them that he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the forest and took off his life.
According to a CV on the University's website, Lamb received a doctorate degree in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Deflection stars
The last few years have been hard for an actor (in a picture with his left son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also been involved with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything's really happened. It's all been demanding its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the page for months with two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke into the Manchester United Championship against the PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will have to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area at Hector Moreno's bad fight when the game was running for 15 minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was transferred to the hospital.
\"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital,\" Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The young man associated with Manchester United’s 18-year-olds has experienced hardship and is now injured after great toys.
In the locker, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the foot breaks from two points, he's on the side of half a month and he's not playing at the block stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have had little effect when the situation did not follow the red card as a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
\"You may conclude yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-foot tact...
Shaw said: “Thank you all for your messages. I can’t describe how sad I am. I’m starting here and I’m getting stronger.
More about Manchester United Luke Shaw page at the PSV match
The British defender has a special reason to recover from the European Championships in France in June.
“It is a very bad injury, ” said the PSV coach.
“In these situations, all parties are always very sorry.
The aim of the players is never to harm the opponent.
Moreno broke his leg while playing in the Mexican lines of Van Gaal’s created Netherlands only in the 2014 World Championships.
“He is very sorry, for his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It’s a shame to hear that the injury is serious,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) was involved in the ball, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
I know how difficult this can be, Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a crash with Chris S Modelng.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, each parent notices that the child learns his favorite book almost from outside.
Except to see David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's churches, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the environmental teacher of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “It’s fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I would like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we haven’t noticed before.
It sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron's intention is to describe the book's plot is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short original text.
“In the city where the right trees and plants have been destroyed and even the air is commercial, the boy is named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into the heart of Audrey’s heart by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree, in the text. In 1991, the version of Dr. Seussin, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted, who had no interest in having it.
If this is not yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: “In the city where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, the boy is called Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey's dream.
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book plot would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys the wood and manufactures Tarviks despite the opposition of the name-name-hem Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, flexible creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that such a minor practic mission is believed to be an assistant's mission, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times as a child.
The Prime Minister told me that the text is probably from the Cameron Elections Office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this, but confirmed that the text was in the hands of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the British team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but we are not expected to see the repeated loss of the last 3-0 Test series in the team selected for the UK tour.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a stranger.
Alastair Cook's side can be more experienced than a three-year-old team, but the punch team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences since 2012, only young positives.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a tour promoter, and Adil Rashid, although he has no test level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the UK Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly difficult for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that critical players are criticised according to results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point match should have been in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets a new chance when he hits the counties.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, which was not surprising me.
The question of how long the Test horse gets the opportunity to impress it is difficult.
Lyth received seven painting games – like his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton had the chance to fight both home and guest.
The only issue of appeal is that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was at the top – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter I value high.
He's an unknown author's critic player, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
There's been an idea that Moeen will start a shot with Cook to get an extra tourr into the game while four fast-eaters are being held, and I'm not against the idea.
I can't see the obstacle that a high-school eater could be hitting here, and this left-wing player has already shown himself to be a great critic.
Moen may not have had much time in his local team at Worcestershire, but he's been a team three player, and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 test matches as the first substitute player before starting in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a backup feeder, and based on what I've seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 feeders – and this can be a search mark, but very many tourrs have not shown themselves to be ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot about this game trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mkyyawarden Jayawarden, as adviser of the Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most beautiful men of the species who brings much experience because he has played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is going to play a game trip to the white ball, bringing both energy and mercy.
In my opinion, he has always had an impact on an appropriate international crisis, whether he was a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has a good intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing before, can be a spray.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root received a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not all agree, trainers and voters do not set the match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs also depend on the results.
These decisions will never be made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is bad in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for maintaining Britain in the EU is still deeper and deeper every day, even without the desire to please Jeremy or not – Corbynia's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC to mock Europe on Tuesday.
In other countries, there are their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomat recently explained how in many crises the EU is struggling – even if not all of them are not doing its own – some of the Member States have become tired of the self-righteous agenda of Britain, which includes concessions which are dissatisfaction and harmful changes to the Treaty which they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of the TUC, it was decided that they would not even enjoy social security in the EU.
We could call it Dave and George's self-agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Union will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catch a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants to have an open-minded UK within the EU Treaty. - Don't leave us alone with France. - Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don't care if we leave or leave.
Angela Merkel, a German-thinking ally Chancellor, is an ally, but he has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the river before it is degraded, as it happened to those who lasted too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or successor's choice in 2017.
He's on his way too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-hand government, the left-wing government in Spain.
It's hard to imagine them trying to help Self-Brits who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they don't want it, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may plan to put in vain useless comments about the Scotland National Party style in the United Kingdom's 2017 referendum campaign, which aims to delay the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The most recent negotiations had been held, and nothing left for the British to renegotiate.
Europeans know how to catch the British press and how the EU-Sceptic Oligarchist magazine is, just as Tony Benn had a referendum in 1975, with a result of 2:1 joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may recall in a distant way Boris Johnson, a professional Euro-opportunist, who became known as our direct banana correspondent in Brussels at the beginning of the '90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
These include tax evasion, phone hacking and visual housing, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about the same thing about them, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he'd have to stretch bananas into a spider so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was the Blacker of Blair in opposition to the referendum, and Blair admitted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was able to make good use of it.
The press never forgiven him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the back of Westminster on Monday night, told him he had no more time to waste on me, and it could be a risk that he'd put in place Neil Kinnock's media book strategy in the '80s, and that was a mistake and still is.
It may take some time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, who, by BBC, he sat on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
The vast majority of people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to be able to respond to this award.
That's what Hilary-Benn, but not Bennite, Benn, was on radio and television this week when his inner Boy tried not to admit that it was a bad call from Corbyn to appoint a Karski John McDonnell as a shadow state minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father was having trouble being on TV without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said that he was opposed to remaining in the EU under all circumstances: Mr McDonnel did not say that neither to his fellow Members of Corby nor to members of the sub-room in a private meeting on Monday night.
Mr Corby cares about how wonderful the picture is, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The gallery is important during the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where healing and fraud can be done.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass with regard to the EU, which could be considered self-evident to support Labour in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
That's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnellin and Corbyn's equivocation from EU membership is compatible with the past of the island economy and capitalism, and the discussions are no longer just a narrow division of left-wing dissidents, for whom the idea of combining similarity is a central lesson in doctrineal shocks.
Tom Watson is inconvenient that Corby does not campaign for his departure. Foreign diplomats have to try to clarify this to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the terrible military performance of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the surgery of Tory government, and I received a reminder on Monday in connection with British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British Authority's opinions on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by the state-funded institution that the smoking of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking, were born at a meeting of 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health Authority Public Health England (PHE) report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE described the report published last month as a reverse and comprehensive review of the results:
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and highlighted the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the last month, Lancet Medical Journal published a haptic basis for which the main conclusion of the PHE was based.
In addition, two researchers have considered in BMJ whether the claims were established for the ‘calculation’ or for the sand.
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University have said: \"The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that, according to the current best estimate, ‘the electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes’ should be based on detailed research results analysis and modelling.
The claim is drawn from a single 12-person meeting, which was convened for the development of a multi-target assessment (multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA) model. The model wanted to harmonise the views of the participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose former CEO's independent research has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT) from sources.
In addition, in the report on sustainable action, the Executive Director demonstrated his support for the functioning of BAT according to public health.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting was awarded funding from the electric cigarettes manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not, however, grant.
There is no explanation of the panel selection criteria, but there are a number of well-known producers of electronic cigarettes, some of which are to be awarded their participation as industry funders.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in combating smoking.
The meeting also participated in the PHE’s tobacco response.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's study report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the adverse effects of the products on the large part of products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, the PHE report does not mention links or shortcomings.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electronic cigarettes can promote smoking by children or non-smoking persons. McKee and Capewell regard the claim as premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the health and well-being director of the PHE has previously responded.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than traditional tobacco risks, but long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what evidence shows and what it does not demonstrate, particularly in a situation where there are no clear risks compared to traditional tobacco.
In the United Kingdom, almost 80 000 deaths are reported per year, and smoking costs a total of two billion pounds per year for public health.
The responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a riskless option, but that the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the sharks of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up East Enders, says Channel 4
Luke Johnson, under the leadership of Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand from hit stars, such as Albert Square, the soap series.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticises the BBC for presenting programmes to the smaller public at the same time as the large number of competitors and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After the President of the BBC, Tony Hall, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC for six years without any results.
\"I do not agree with the idea that BBC will buy formats and send programmes that would clearly be part of some competing channel software,\" Johnson told Parliament's High Room Communications Committee, which explained the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I believe is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to at least the programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to the best viewing time, because it wants as wide as possible support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned about the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
“I do not understand why the tax on regressives should finance programmes that could be financed without aid,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, even though it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give you their right hand about it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcasting company.
I don't think this would be a loss for BBC.
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur, which was led by Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, and he felt that BBC had good ratings because the company is working on ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the most popular series of BBCs are similar to the former Sky Pomon Tony Ball, which proposed in the MacTaggart lecture in 2003, that BBC sells out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for the BBC niche general are shown on BBC4, where viewers are often not able to measure, but they fulfil their purpose.
\"BBC will present them at times where no one will ever see them.
Johnson said: “I'm going to have you look for another one in the sense of an old-fashioned system, who gets the best advantage.
Of course, everyone thinks it's worth 150 pounds a year, but people for whom it's a big deal, especially if the BBC doesn't look at it.
David Elstein, former Head of Sky and Channel 5, who also expressed his own views at the Committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient commissions with new information, instruction, and entertaining:
According to Elstein, teaching programmes – 1 per cent on TV and 0.1 per cent on radio – are hardly on BBC's current offer, and he adds that BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies and break up its Commission into new faith: \"information, lighting and entertaining\".
Elstein proposes that the BBC be able to increase broadcasts, for example, such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were sent only a fraction last year.
Brain cells can be controlled on sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how to change the shuttle noise when it is applied to ultrasounds.
The researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so the worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle ships change in their direction when they are applied to ultrasounds, the frequency of which is above the hearing area of the human ear.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that reacts to the ultrasound.
More on: Researchers follow brain activity using light
According to researchers, a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics) was shown in the worms. In the process, ultrasound is used to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritation coming from outside the body.
The Salk Instuten researcher in California La Jolla, Sreekant Chalasani, told Guardian that one day the method can be replaced by deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method for treating Parkinson’s disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated with electrical pulses.
Chalasani noticed that the worms would start to react when they were placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
Chalasan says that the rubbers are amplified by ultrasound waves that are moving into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ionics, which are part of worm cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate cells to which they are attached.
In order to control shuttles with ultravogue Chalasani changed worms genetically so that some of their driving nerves appeared in the TRP4 ionics.
When ultrasonics were controlled, the microcircuits strengthened the sound waves and moved to the distances, when the nerve cell started to move the signal.
The method reminds me of a bit of optogenetics that is a revolutionary tool that enables researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
However, Chalasan says that sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optical genetics.
Light on the brain under investigation is controlled by light fibers. Low-speed ultrasounds, instead, pass the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be controlled through the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and viral treatment can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in cells producing insulin.
Unlawful torture devices – on your door!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arming mass video.
Creepy killer instructions!
Necks breaker legs!
Robbery bombs!
Remote lasers that cause irresponsible pain but do not leave any trace!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British government's attempt to sell weapons to the repression governments at DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) Fairs, which are organized at the ExCel Fair in the London Docklands.

The bus stops and metro wagons also have posters that require a second look.
“A major announcement: you’re moving on a subway between 15 and 8 September. The notice reminds you of the announcements of the London subway, and the picture of the tank is on the other side of the metroline.
\"In September, a number of arms dealers arrive at Docklands. Customers are asked to help stop weapons fairs.
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruz Designs.
The collective called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution of posters around London with a six-tier-six-floor auction package with six-tier keys that claim to access about one-third of the world’s bus stop advertising posters.
Transport for London is not a celebrity vandalism.
One of Special Patrol Group's collectibles.
According to the Cruel Designs Curator and the professor Gavin Grindon at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and to bring political work to the public for sight outside the gallery.
The artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought to the true world. Many move to work with the activists of protests.
One of the posters against arms trade greets public transport users in the subway.
Amnessty's video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times in the course of the day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the editor have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, threw away the absence of mass advertising and nothing to do with the event calendar in ExCeL. He was building: \"Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid.
They tried to draw a more realistic, vague corporate video, but bright colors and animation raise attention better.
“They have done a wonderful job and helped us raise the fairs in which illegal torture is carried out, ” says Amnesstyn Tom Davies.
\"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not traded illegally on our home door;
However, perhaps the most creative anti-dosage is presented in the exhibition halls in ExCeL, where the exhibitors take advantage of the great circular expressions of their trade.

Eight golden rules for students living in student housing
I moved to a student home 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in barettes and moral relativities, and I remember now the violent smiles that I was annoying, and countless, long complaints to others.
The main lessons can be summed up into eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment is the least challenging experience and the worst to shock.
It's easy to say: you tell everyone where you are, you have an interim year, and why you like Corby, and why you don't hate or love Marmite, because it's just a hiccup, a ashtray, I'm in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other questions.
Questioning will guide the discussion and help you find the people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your eyelashes were on display and these people would split up the triggers.
Give the rest of the room.
Their own rooms are often used as drinks, movie theatres and general accommodation rooms, but their own room is also a place where they dress up, starting with underwear.
Add to the subject: Do not even think you will combine dating and university studies
The Introverte University is a tough place
However, many apartments have a social culture that moves from room to room and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can download the energy I used by dating you.
Try to see if any of your fellow students are exhausted from social contact. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of struggle, knock.
In my own student apartment there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get your friends out of here with a baker.
You're starting your study properly when you're in, so if you're eating brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50s, you're a little weird, you're welcome to the neighborhood, I've had something to eat for you.
Homemade deliciouss are a great way to get new friends.
Your student friends are forced to talk to you, and a tasteful surprise allows them to stay a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakery skills from you.
If you serve unlucky flour, sugar, and fat cookers, the others probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common problem in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can someone else's milk can pour it in their tea?
Always check the milk can from the owner.
I'm sure you'll get a permit, even if the milk loan is to the owner of the canal.
I understand very well that it's annoying if someone's taking something from you, but try to treat the situation as adults as much as possible – unlike my own studymate, who'd choked his milk to punish dairy thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't get used to it when everyone else is trying to sleep or go to sleep.
It's not just because it's polite, it's also worth remembering that anyone else digs a hole...
In my own apartment, a girl asked a living room next door to adjust the music to a smaller one, as it was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally quiet in the next room, the girl let her neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate happened to move to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your study partner would be your future mate, would you start dating, resign and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet him with your friends?
I'm sure the heart wants what it wants, but if the student friend is definitely not the only one, try to control him.
If you notice at a time when someone has forgotten their keys to the room whose door has not been locked, the limit of clashing and bullying is less than they could think.
It's a good joke, but it's someone that's gonna be okay in a minute.
Hideing some object can be a valuable and fun teaching, but no room should be mixed with toothpaste and sampool.
The door of the other room can be locked and dropped into a glass of water, which is placed in a freezer, but do not attach any goods to the ceiling with a blue bar a few more times.
A racist blow to the shelter of foreign students in Kite, when the house was planned to be received at the reception center, was strangled in Salo.
There was a racist attack on the premises of foreign students in Kite, North Karelia on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police mentioned earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors but the sleeping mats of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Lukekainen, a teacher of Kiteen Evangelical folk school.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities were strangled by racist markings, such as gypsies, and a metal object had been thrown through a single room window, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher for social security training at the university’s youth college, the building under the influence of an evil authority was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some might be elsewhere,” says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are occupied by the National School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as under-represented asylum seekers who have only arrived.
All those who were in a rowing building have A-stations.
Part of the study at adult school, part of vocational studies, and part of the study in Finnish, says Luke.
A status is so-called a continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack in the form of damage and damage to home peace.
According to Luke, students were held on Monday at a press conference, where the necessary interpretations were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had twenty years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens, Luke says.
Luke says the mess's already been cleaned out of the wall.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been on a light passenger car.
I think this is the top of the young weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, Luke says.
Salo also has a hospital with a planned reception centre.
The incident happened last week.
This is about MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn and written in English, You are not welcome
The case has been reported to the police.
Revision 15.9 at 16.02 corrected police information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state is breaking up the passengers of the Y-jun to the Karjaa, with their gums, from the ancient idiotics.
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa stops moving in March.
The news was agitated by passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, the suburbs hit the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström in the municipality.
It's idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming to the capital even if it's a tractor.
There will also be train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new line of R.
The station of Purola in Järvenpää and the use of Nupplinna in Tuusula are excluded.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the route to which the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period is changing during the year and the routes to be stopped are in the country as a whole.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be subsequently approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siuntiolainen, considers that the public train camp is short-sighted.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be a regret.
Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and passing over multiple stations.
The Espoolainen Annina Pöyry, on the train, was ashamed of the fate of travelers beyond the city area.
“It’s very bad for those who have to plan their journey again, ” he said when he pained the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) region, i.e. to Kirkkunum.
This will increase the cost to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year from the Y train, the Ministry certainly did much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves between two positions.
Instead, in Ainola and in Sauna Kallio, the number of train trains is doubled.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic on the routes in Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Sinajoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu route will be shortened as a route to Piksämäki-Varku.
Trains are reduced on routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made per year, with a total of about nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The aim of the new agreement is to bring to the state the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Finality Book: “Marxin should be familiar with:
The world economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his work on capital in 1867-1894, writing in the book Marx's Mainoma, which is the former president of GDP, the author of Yrjö Hakane published today.
He is now being taken more seriously than for a long time. Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and entry into all sectors of life, concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly long-term.
The writer list of the book based on the Capital Seminars of Hakake is also presented by the professor of Aalto University, a well-reputed economicist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current, and forever,
But the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Department of Economics is not Marxish, is he?
Oh, my God.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences have distinguished and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociology, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and author of literature.
“The public perception of the history of the dead is that the false opinions of the dead men, ” Korkman, begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far from the beginning of capitalism conclusions, Korkman thought.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
\"The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions,\" he says.
Another discussion is about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that changes as a result of the technical revolution, ” Corkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not gonna help Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was an hopeless case that should just be stopped.
And yet, Marxin's opinion is that Korkman should be familiar with it.
“In the '70s, Marx could not be read, ” Korkman says.
“Males and Trotskians and other sects hated all capitalisms, but more and more, ”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weights of the years back.
\"Some social scientist should be familiar with Marx's idea world, as with other classes,\" says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as the tamilis.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the civil war in Sri Lanka.
There's no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of armed forces in the last months of a long war should be examined properly, and the UN report calls for it.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report is responsible for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women were victims.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forced by bystanders and children as fighters.
Both sides, according to the report, have committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the English yo test, social media was able to weigh
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language that was English in the majority of the books in Syksy.
His English skills tested more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, the substance could write about social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a letter in English 150-250 could give a web page counseling board to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt responds to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents could look at matters for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, one was to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them, ” estimates the third topic of Porvoo’s Swedish high school in English, Mia Lybeck.
The third topic was merely a sitate from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said, was so nice.
It was meant to write a fire call, why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write talks,” says Lybeck, and estimates the whole test, “meel to be normal. ”
In the English test in Finland - or in Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, put the adaptation of the summer campaign to climate change and the handling of large mass data.
Some long Russian (68 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
Syksy’s articles continue on Friday, which is the turn of another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The tests are organised normally, i.e. the expression of the employees' minds does not affect them.
The university of higher education invites the experienced people to search for appropriate transport links in time to get to the audition.
Additional time may also be obtained if it can be demonstrated that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
Stored in Oulu with a gun threat
The shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in the district of Kelo.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a comendop covering his face.
He's normal, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to catch.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The expression of mind against government cutting decisions will be blocked on Friday at the centre of Helsinki, predicted by the police.
In advance, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Planned and STK Associations will meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mentality.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out alarming tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth functioning of the drumming expression.
The road to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles at approximately 9.30-14 p.m.
All we can do is get the alarm vehicles in the area.
From the direction of Hakanieme, traffic will be cut off from the road of Kaisaniemi, westward from Mannerheiminti.
Is the people at Helsinki Police Department enough, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala Helsinki, support parties are coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland because of the demonstration of mind.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
There's going to be a lot of people coming, but, as a rule, we'll be doing it on our own, Kujala says.
The police are calling on us to avoid private car rental in Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors coming from other parts of Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to Rautatientori.
Buses tend to be far away from the point of view.
The rest of the trip then has to walk to the demonstration site, Kujala says.
The expression of mind also stops the public transport of Helsinki.
From the police' point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally handled by these big gatherings, is now partly self-responsible.
Mental expression organisers have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful. Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local demonstrations will also be held on Friday.
Friday's demonstration of mind is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these lakes and demonstrations?
In many ways, the great expression of mind, organised on Friday by trade unions, is interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it'd raise your hands up in front of the government, She says.
The very right government has hit the core points of Finnish corporateism - and also those that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's heavy claims are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has the place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because there is no support for Friday's demonstrations by all employees.
The new is now the sharp division that the expression of mind will bring about among the one that ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered across Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, which was held in 1993, then said.
In the middle of the deeper sheep, Murrostorstai collected 20,000 unemployed persons.
Esko Ahon (mainly) government tripped from labour market crisis to crisis.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho Bóvari government.
Now, maybe even worse between the government and the Ay movement than at the time of the Murrostorst.
Besides, Finland is now a very bourgeois government in power, says Siseiinen.
The current government coalition is still of such interest that it is such a strict right despite the words of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the crash.
A number of thousands of protestors are expected on Friday.
The expression of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres as well as schools.
Even if the expression of mind does not receive undivided support from employees, it may come to the greatest number of years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki in recent years.
They're out of range.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations of ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the methods of action have worsened in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, are legal.
Spiriters strive to avoid damage or destruction of property, says the Prince.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The spirit culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw chicken eggs and the police decided to get the pig shit on.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, there were visible strikes on pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikees and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes of the 1970s
In 1971, the most significant warehouses in the 1970s were the metal lake and the power plant and electricity lake in 1977.
The metal men's strike took part in 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended with a proposal from the Conciliation Committee for seven weeks after the strike.
Metalmen received an increase of 16%.
The electric lake in the spring of 1977 lasted 49 days and caused electrical losses all over the country.
Murrostoristi in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people met at Parliament’s Parliamentary House, many of the poor unemployed, to show their views on the job.
The firemen ceased for three months in 1998.
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Agriculture opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police came to the hake in the farmers' protests against the EU in 1994.
\"Siperia teaches, the EU stops,\" there was one of the punch clauses.
Espa's farmers killed tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and to burn hazes in front of the meeting site.
In 1983 and 1995, care providers ceased to exist.
Hospital nurses stopped in 1995 for about a month.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
It was threatened by strike and mass transfer of nurses in 2007.
In the end, there was a threat of mass attack.
Doctors strike in 2001
The doctors in the strike, the escape, belonged to a clash of law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The death of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted a five-month period and resulted in a lively debate on how to endanger patient safety.
After the law, the public sector raised the medical salary.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5 000 students march in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police finds out that there were backs of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out about the backgrounds of the refugees registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the event in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died by suffocating.
According to the public radio first told about cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company conducts restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreignist, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for trafficking in human beings in Austria.
Captain refugees, former drug offender and an uplifting businessman - the story of five smugglers.
The king of high-end smugglers, the violent boatman, the stylish missionary and the cab driver himself as a good guy.
For example, such people carry on trafficking in human beings in the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and the supplier Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and clients, and their book Death Travel Office will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present human trafficking hipsters, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the tunnels are heading there for summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: The distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in the chain, the captain burning in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
Emir has done that in a blue, ten-foot wooden boat for hundreds of years.
If you fill the ship's feathers, there's 40 people in it.
One trip Emir makes some EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers are arriving from many countries, but during the Arab spring, a huge number of people in Tunisia wanted to escape restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as you can see fit.
Food is given so that customers are just and live.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer ends up with the money, it's their problem.
The water will be released at midnight with a cut off.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait a day, and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and throw up in a 20 - meter - high wave.
The human cargo has been bitten in half an hour, and Emir leaves for return.
Emir wants him scared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least he claims he's going to beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the ship and told them to swim on the nearest island.
\"I used the clients on my own, and I threw them overboard,\" Emir says in the book.
The ironiest passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
He says he's got to deal with this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
They need to be shown immediately who's to be ordered here.
Just a normal cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary cab driver in Bofovasha in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter's been pulling at last, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
However, the main point for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards Hungary's border.
Bohovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
It is located next to the village, a centre for asylum seekers, where families are primarily allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men who travel without their families will be housed in tents, villages and abandoned cars, which are now able to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
In the woods, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - via the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in a difficult land, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
In the end, when they arrive in the region of Bofovasha, in the node of the great human trafficking, people are dying.
The Gypsies of Goran are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best clients are the Syrians, he says in the book.
They say it once, and that's enough, Gora's compliment.
He says the Africans are trying to do a trick.
That's not what Goran likes.
You stupid fool all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, 300 euros, then they'll count to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and kindhearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people. He says in the book.
Goran tells us that he will work less than the others and that he will only make 50 euros of his ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a three-mile road trip, most of the nicest part of the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Gora deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for a smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered the taxis not to be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the arrows and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and goes away.
In the Work of the Prayer
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Cambodia, where a lot of those who fled from the Congo will be visited, as well as a small center where the Congolese refugees will be helped.
In addition to preaching, the Ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoe many times a day and takes care that the rubber tape of the white skulls is squeezing in style under the low waist of the jeans.
The ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call someone from the five telephone numbers of the Ambassador.
He advises that it is worth coming to the border in the morning, hiding the money in the water and insulting the traffickers across the border.
In order to reach the authorities of the asylum seeker or refugee status in Uganda, it must be said that there are, for example, war zones in northern Kiev, and that there has been violence in their homes.
It's often true, but if it isn't, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and the second will be acquired.
That's what they'll do to help the Closer's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually UNHCR.
A missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the lodging of an application to the Ugandan police will cost approximately EUR 100, the handling of documents to humanitarian organisations of some EUR 150 and the migration process in some European countries, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and icebergs
Tom's a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A four-year Irish warden on the coast of Calais, France, where his work is to load people to the trucks on his way to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French cab driver and dozens of trucks who don't necessarily even know he's in a human trafficking business.
At night Tom and the cab driver pick up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from someone near the center of Calais.
They drive A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for the organisation of illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a place where the driver sleeps before they continue across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure he's on his way to England right now, and he's not going to the Netherlands, and he's cutting off the safety guard.
It's gotta be done quietly so that the kids don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the line, but then the truck is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client with an aluminium foil, the same one that is wrapped in the kitchen around a shirt or oven potato.
It should prevent the police from detecting a hideout.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck, and he's out there hoping he doesn't blow up the smugglers, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human transporters.
The Upocalytic Turkish have been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the Indisputable Countries of the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçuk has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is luxury: Turkish ports are leased for tourist cruises for a few days to accommodate Americans or European families.
In fact, ships will be loaded to fill in the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, which will be transported against EUR 5 000-7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and then to a sea Europe.
Customers will be stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People are being turned to minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay under the deck all the way.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and throw up, the better.
Küçuk will receive around EUR 53 000 after a luxury trip.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, staffers and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, transports are organised at least hundreds and Küçuk makes millions.
He estimates that he bought through undercover companies, a country, a pharmaceutical company, and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He's probably lost since then.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10 p.m.: Death Travel Office will appear here, not next week.
American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-meter runner, has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book called Fast Girl about ending his career and driving into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published articles of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in high school and ran away for the second time.
But in the finals, he was panicking.
At the beginning, he ran to the top and defended his position with a ground run.
Yet, at 150 meters before the goal, his strength was erupted.
He broke into the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I was forced over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-way disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney's competitions, and he himself felt enormous successes.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no financial problems in the park, but he was passionate about having money to have sex with other men.
He also called on his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me that he's spent the money in his luxury life.
One example of Favor Hamilton as a prostitute was that he needed adrenaline stitches similar to that he had received in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters away with the world’s statistical rate of 3.57,40, but remained the last one in Sydney’s Olympic Final.
The master of the world was exhilarating when the union put Norway in the middle of a ski bowl: “Supreshing.
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of compliance in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian ski union have turned the whole summer and the fall into a sports agreement.
Even though the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multi-faceted world champion and Olympic winner.
The association of Norwegian skiings decided to close Northug out of the future World Cup.
The decision was a thank-you from a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put a ski dress under control.
Thank you for pointing the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one of the active athletes to avoid working for the Union sponsor, ” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the whole country team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and does not give one athlete in the fields.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had given Northug both economic and other special rights for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb refuses to accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, where he assured his desire to be braved in Norwegian Springs next season in the world Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two of which were gold.
He was involved last winter in Falun's message cult in the winning team.
The day of the button-turner shall also be spent in the North Sea
On Thursday, 25 September, stamps are held in various restaurants and shops for which the Paisin translators' shield has been granted.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food skills and reduce the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that all high-level restaurants have not focused on the capital region, but on top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the thyroid conditions and the organisation.
In northern Finland the day is held in Vaasa, Vaasa, the restaurant is held in Fondi and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, there's a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to do one of the most important international events in the organization, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the municipalities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent location in the region of critical crisis-time infrastructure, which is used by defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Erillisnets Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building package would constitute an important safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former aviation school and the airport, whose impact has not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that, for the long-term field, negotiations have been held for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Head of Defence Department, Arto Rädy.
A private person states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition from the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city government of Kahavan handled the reception center case last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea Region
The management means that immigrants and those here need to have the necessary conditions, Niinist comments in the evening to journalists after meeting all the Presidents of the Parliamentary Party in Mänttyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all the participants.
He values the ability of government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the Netherlands, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
There is a desire for nobility in the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive way, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Nimista, NATO was also sidelined in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.

Media researcher: Sipilta takes a huge risk
According to Sipil, many channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipil did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio phones would become.
According to the Sipil, talk may not always be transmitted in the future on Yle channels.
If other channels are reported as channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipil, the state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio to the public.
This whole issue, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Sipili figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and on Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Spil takes a big risk
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television phone will not tell us more about the government's inward turn.
Is it an effort to define a public debate more closely in your own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions of the public debate?
I remember the recent comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he did not follow the media agenda and let it not define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be linked.
The dog understands that commercial media has become nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not about democracy.
It is for the media's representatives to be defined to seek that political agendas are not adopted.
According to the dawn, television is a major risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, there should be something new and special on the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more to offer today that we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way, or would he say something new?
The dog says that if there is only more of the same old in the permit, it must be wondered why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
This is also a risk in the sense that it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is marked as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or general policy.
Swirl-toe bet
What the Prime Minister leaves without saying is also important in the future speech, the media scientist stresses.
Tonight, we should look carefully at where Sipil is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutt, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Six, the TV call is from Sipil's door for this to bring out its own view without the rings.
This is the case for the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at the press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The spark will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media misinterprets the speech because there are no specific questions to ask.
According to the Six, it's very important to see how Sipil appears on TV... if there's any sweat in his hands.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila knows how to do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that of the government to give information about something, because this is a person as if he speaks directly to another person.
This is what the President of the United States Barack is doing, Obama and its partners regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the public is very exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make Finns so compassionate to the conflicts ahead.
The employees' organisations are organising protests and strikes against the government's actions on Friday.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipilä could give his speech on the status of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge to Sipila's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
It's about six months from the election.
You can't hide for the rest of the time, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a escape trip has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Ministry of Justice of the Interior will also confirm the matter to the newspaper.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later this evening, he was never contacted again.
Dad thanks all those people who helped him find him.
Thank you for these ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in so short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent abuse of young people.
A sadistic freelancer, Makwan Amirkhani, published a video on Facebook, which appeals especially to young people from migrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young people's streetfights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and who was five years old with his family in Finland, has won both his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that she received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
Video has been downloaded to the account, where young people fight extremely violently.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in the bullying of young people.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the ground, sitting on the other side, and hitting the eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that are caused by this when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the video have immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from the heel.
Not to mention you're fighting on the street.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has sites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
It's a little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests for quite a long time here.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever end up being the target of some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make you any better, Amirkhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions Monday
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the wage organisation will consider its position on Monday on its alternative savings presented by STKK.
Lauuri Lyly commented on the STK's proposal on Twitter.
In the past Wednesday, STKI informed the government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (medium).
Mr Fjäder, President of the Plan, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKI and A scheme are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the matter in brief on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock and the need for agreements concluded by active parties on the basis of the forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
The Sipils previously cut the negotiations on the social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: High-defence threatens to choke, I think it's a little funny to put on a fist.
I think it's a little funny to put on a fist, if there's already a match paper in your pocket, then sign Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary from width to width in the employee camp.
Is it supposed to yell at the government or agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAKs will wipe out the sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the deserts too.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), President of the STKT, was agreed.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity block, which was required by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (medium).
Mr Fjäder (Kok) has immediately called on him to state that his piece of paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't belong in the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to deal with when the allies on Monday were asked to put the country on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to open up the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept the 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations in order with the Sipilian government.
The right hand of the Palola, Jukka Beauty, director of the social impact of the STKK, used to act as special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
So Palola described the government's ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Sattumaa or no, but Palola's exit took a bit of a clean off the Finnish standouts, which, as a pinshot, were strangled by the ACP Marko Pirate (sd).
I think it's a little funny to put on a fist if there's already a match paper in your pocket.
modified at 18.00: Added information on Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again. \"
The President of the Russian duuma, Mr Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Mr Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian duuma, said Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Uran Bator, the guilty court of the Parliamentary Assembly of Etyj, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union, to attend a meeting - a matter from which the President would remind journalists.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's pressurised news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk declared.
Mongolia's Russian delegation got complicated, so Naryshkin continued to hide Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia's different organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff section:
Tappara and Luku continue today in Hakamets for bully days when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today's Hakamets is not a real goal party.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night, digging for a 3-time profit from KalPa.
The rise was a manly one, for last season's silver group was at its worst in the defeat of two goals.
The lock on the title was more than just a lot more successful.
Blues, a regular guest of the peaceful prey, was round zero points, and loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Luk-eatingr Janne Lahti predicts the settings on the company's pages.
Tappara has formed quite a playoff button for the rams.
In fact, in the last two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the final series of Luko.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh race has been required.
In the last season, Luku took the series to a quarter of the game, but Tappara rose up in the next three parallels and passed.
There are no major changes in group compositions except paint defects.
Both of the soldiers who fought last night will be able to get their sister-in-law today.
With the killer's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the plugs Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Sight angle: A terrible play is happening in the voice
The Director-General of Sports, Katila, handed the chief coach to Rautakallio an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stalone hand-printed Rocky film where he himself played the main part.
The underprivilegator was sensationally placing a heavy series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Lumula handed to Pori the restless ashtray.
A nameless and wooden baker made it possible for all to be astonished to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underprivilegers like Rocky.
It was White Indian, Porin Matta and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players dyed their heads red and cut the irony.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the won silver.
The hope was one of the heroes.
The writer hopes that the novelty of this season will work in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the leader of the father's sports activities has built a piece of shit for the bad guys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting garbage in the remote, like Rocky pig feeds at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than to play in a hot game.
The hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part is to present the Pega Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Union with Sean Connerjek.
Rautakallio is writing in Rocky the same clumsy as Connery would have been in the original of 1976.
There's nothing left in the Iron Rocky except a nickname.
The philosophy of the Iron Curtain is not part of the routing and pygmy.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Essien Garrett Stafford took your jacket to the head of the Tapparan Jere Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
All we have is those who deserve.
I will not accept such a game and it will not belong to an assieke, a hot Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satanus.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's jocks, vets, cops, and cranberrys.
There are no key players in the game age in practice.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pega Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, and Rautakallio was diplomatically responsible.
I'll take a ride.
In 1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of hopela to be a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The noise balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses with goal difference 1-6.
The hope would not have been in favour of the script.
Olga Temone plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if he had met his husband as a teenager in Tuuka, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I play my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laugh.
He has been married to Apulanna ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple's done a lot of work together before, but for the first time Olga plays Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanta is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, although his father Risto (who present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I've known my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with a role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has been very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've communicated.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Sirkka also realizes that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula will become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and a real duck.
It was quite a small probability that someone would really succeed, but Sirka had some kind of initiative, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this youth even before filming.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how much older do you really know what you're up to?
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil story.
Olga was an arch and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the top, he could've had a secret crush.
According to Olga, in 10 years he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project does not scare.
Everything's always been a super-good.
Now, the entire production team will be leaving for a month to describe Heinola.
However, because of their small children, a couple living in ancient Israel often plans to drive home for the night because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the entire Heinola for the month.
They have taken us very warmly, asking only what streets and when they will be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
Timo Vuorensola directed by Iron Sky: The Come Race is a budget of EUR 17 million.
The descriptions start in October in Belgium.
The director, Timo Vuoreensola, begins shooting the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
Scientific film of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Come Race, will become the most expensive play movie of all time in Finland with its budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has been in Jalmar Helander Big Gam.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being carried out, will also be passed by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over €100 million.
Timo Vuorensola directed and film produced by Tero Kaukoma begins in October near Antwerp, and lasts eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the left-over budget.
I've been so sick!
I have such a relaxing file about scripting, because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that they're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, and he's telling the newspaper.
Originally, 8-10 million were planned for the film budget, but when the script was developed, the budget also increased.
The budget's big, but there's a big stop.
However, 100 million people would get stuck in the film, because each angle and efficiency is so expensive.
Now everything's been shattered so tight that there's no loose ends.
Today, the film production company Iron Sky University launched a mass finance campaign and a crowd loan, which will be paid at 4-8% per annum.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
Among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov play a role in this film.
Juntt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the TRendsets have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in his console.
The advertising of a hooder or a T-shirt was seen as some kind of juntist.
But times change.
Sport has become the right megadradrend of the fashion, and so are the old, familiar sports symbols such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, a funny and trendy limit is horrific: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core trend, i.e. the tavismot, where the trendsters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as possible.
Now, instead of the grey base collegiate, we're going to have to put on the girdle that's buried on the bottom of the cabinet, before which the manufacturer's logo is commanded.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' identifying track curtains, the game shirts for the favorite team and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
For starters, the Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, Versace's breasts make it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I didn't get stuck in a tank hole!
According to the claims, a special incident would have happened in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In the recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful arguments that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove from the large-scale gas hole in Zotovia for five hours.
Zotov has done all he can to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook site, he published a picture of the opening of the armor vehicle in a very good atmosphere, and not at least on the basis of their images, it's not about jugging or kissing.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a combat tanks car, it was a front-run armor wagon BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served on Ural.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out alone, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the TV channel of the Russian army, Zotov explained at his exhibition the new Russian technology as he himself was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And also at the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the editor a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and rusty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja Sluzhba's novosteii radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged Judas have been published, even though during a few days a total of 50,000 people attended the arms exhibition.
The claim that Zotov's chat started with the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told of his extremities as he tried and finally threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of the coating.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up discussion where the exhibition organisers told them what happened.
All of them are used to the rapid jump out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his big composition, simply stayed when he came out.
But he did not sit in it for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

The mines of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland have been leaked.
The purified process water for gold mines has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandal to its well.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the bleeding.
At Altaa is neutralized by the foaming process, the enriched sand and purified process water.
In general, water is injected either as a re-use water or as an authorisation, through the surface lighting field, into the environment.
The rate was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
The rest of the matter didn't hurt the environment.
The year was observed during the verification round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been observed in the building structure of the pool.
The company reports that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danski Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the IMF, is largely following the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation fled structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppämä, the Danske Bank’s main object is to agree on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of accompanying message for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be too cut off.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economic Sanctuary.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects would also be in favour of implementing as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% in Finland for this year, which is rising to 0.9% next year.
Danske is predicting today that today's new industry forecast will continue to grow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been at the bottom of the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in the summer of small growth, Kuopoväki says.
Less attention has been given to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer measures.
However, there are only a few percent of decimals involved.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed the new leader
In July, under the responsibility of Satoru Iwata, worked at Tatsumi Kimishima, who started his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic in the face of the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii-konsol hip-station.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for monitoring Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hidek Yasuda Reuters.
It is the task of Kimishima to see that Nintendo is strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
There will be more and more asylum seekers in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, according to the Swedish Immigration Office, have reported that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country.
The Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in less than - a year? - A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013 alone.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared in Kannelmaa reports.
In the context of the disappearance, it can be found that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may be found to be full age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the responsible country.
Similarly, a part of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were total 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adults lost their asylum seekers during the last 123 years, he says.
Is there any growth?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications, which came alone.
The total statistics on minors lost this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of lost persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have decided to turn?
They are also lost to the labour market, for example:
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police, who is responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, stressed.
The Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered country seekers.
He's taken action on this.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo asked about refugee issues on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen for TV and radio production is now on sale because of the disease scene.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional equipment in his field.
The first time I told you about the online announcement was the evening mascot.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer described for the Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are interested parties.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are a lot of amateurs - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thought about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä's home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear that a man who has a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only supplies and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which was held by representatives in a box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskyla.
Traffic threatens to go down worse than you think: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The metro and track wagon drivers decide today whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and rail wagon traffic only for Friday's demonstration of mind.
In the afternoon, you'll find out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Inspector Pega Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and daytime surgery is a big challenge for drivers, so the government plans to cut the flowers raise opposition.
However, it is a kind of dilemma that has been considered by Hirvonen to stop traffic all day.
If the metro and rail wagons stand on Friday, public transport will be almost completely stopped in the capital region.
According to the VR data, trains do not travel on Friday between dawn and night.
On Friday nights, there's no road or long distance traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be driven to destination.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain in the shadow.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday at 3:00 p.m. to Saturday morning at 3:00 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by superior, HSL informant Pirkko Repo is charged.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
The employees' organisations organise a major demonstration on the Helsinki Rautatientori Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian and Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward in Europe, reports the news office AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at the school in Texas. The teacher thought he was a bomb.
In the United States, Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered the clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to introduce his electronics experience in output.
One of the teachers, however, considered the clock just looking like a bomb.
The police were invited to appear, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to the youth detention cell in handrails.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
Yet, it is still possible for him to be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said that the clock had been shown by a film bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital display that had leadership between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is upset about the case and the American-Islamic Council in the country is considering whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain meets - Director Labour refused to sing national song
In song, God is being asked to protect the queen, but Corby is a opponent of monarchy.
Corbyn’s own own labour party’s representatives have also joined the criticism presented by an omnipotential press.
This has hurt the people, thought of the labur-citizen Kate Green public radio company in the BBC radio interview.
Green thought that Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's Memorial event respected the battle of British Airmen's pilots against Germany's Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses the respect he has shown for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in enormous gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in the course of the national song, the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear him to escape moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armament, ending savings and increasing public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to be present in Parliament at the Question Time of the Prime Minister.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was on Twitter for the weekend to pick Corbyn as a party manager.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families, and the Prime Minister has quoted it in his own account.
The reason for a family death in Minnesota was still unclear - the family's father was waiting for a case.
South Lake Mintonka's police have been investigating the family death of Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five - breathed family was found dead on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
When he first shot his wife and three children Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Days spent dead
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house and found a huge house on the other side of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and successful companies
The investigation of the South Lake Mintonka Police Chief, Michael Siair, is still ongoing.
The motive for blood vessels is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the dedicated social media site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune's interview, Short told us that there are four million different visitors on the site per week.
I've been made up of 50 purchases from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short's family bought a hulpe house from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised as a dream on the real estate website in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight garages.
Court proceedings on the ground
But according to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-op courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, comments were not deleted from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loir offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner's coin was awarded at the Finnish Hippos month horse owners' prize.
This is great, Lorir commented in a good mood on his honour board.
The celebrated Factory Duo won Derby's first Saturday and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused with the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the rescue horse coach Korpi gets a full-time job with a horse.
The blade will be set and will decide where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loir's laughing.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star, the greatest athlete gift ever made.
The Montreal Canadiens Superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical report, this is the biggest single donation by the athlete of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban and Canadiens signed an agreement worth $8 years and $ 72 million.
Therefore, Subban’s donation amount is significantly higher than his annual budget of $9 million.
Subba will receive the lobbying space from the hospital as a reward for his donation.
The Canadians' players have before helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other city's big hospital to receive the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
The Japanese coffee shop can order a wife for the night, serving only the bikinis and the essu on her head.
The theme cafés are tough in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee shop, a cinnamon coffee shop, a vampire coffee shop, a fish coffee shop, and now a coffee shop.
It's hitting on lonely, socialized, and hungry.
It's about Metro.
The Tokyo Ore no Yome (My wife) coffee shop can be ordered for a wife or husband's night.
It's a waitress who pretends to be a client's spouse.
\"Puoliso\" is chosen from the list before the coffee shop arrives, and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just an essus and a bikini on her head, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidates at all times, with what kind of pillow they prefer to sleep.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: they began to equip themselves with attacks against car security
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support technological developments and innovation in the sector, and Intel's release reports will be discussed.
The panel is composed of top security experts across the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can spend, create and share online data.
We can and we must improve car cybersecurity, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important element in the design of every vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six rising.
Finally, the car starts to be around in Finland.
Ford published the RS data now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt auto exhibition.
Due to Ford's new four-wheel RS, its 2.3-litre, 350 horse-power engine has a maximum speed of 266 km per hour in 4.7 seconds.
The price is also interesting for Finland, initially it is said to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell in his newsletter.
The favourite mark Kia presented two news in the Frankfurt auto exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
Finland is certainly more important than two new ones, the new fourth generation Sportage, which Kia intends to capture from the ever-growing street-stamping markets of the larger wing.
The new European design leader Gregory Guillaume, created by the new European design leader, is more round than ever.
There's been a cent in between axles and external dimensions, and the car's going to crack the air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but has been added to the 1.6-litre turbo to develop 177 horse power.
More Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the year between, our country got the new Kia Optimats.
Suddenly, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
It intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
At the beginning, Optims with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines are available.
Next summer, the pace will grow when Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbojet.
In the same time, it starts selling Optima Farm.
Chisu returned to the stage... ..with a bold hammer suit.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have to look like an open neck hole.
The apartment presents a beautiful singer star's belt.
The size of the crown is the gold metal belt and the red lips.
During a three - year break, a singer who became mother has been strung with light movement and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be filling in for a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
After a long break, I'm not really excited to get back on the stage and get up front of the public.
It's been a shame to do everything about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish a new album in a couple of weeks, while his fourth album is called Polaris.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's mother's style of obsessive resembling... now it's visible in the chest.
The true-tv beauty, Kim Kardashian, will give talks for one another.
He presents his pregnant wife and bra in sexy clothes, last night at one American time when he left Kourtney Kardashian with his sister, husband, Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the front of the breasts.
It reveals the colourful bras under the dress when flashed with lightning lights.
The last time Kardashian was dressed as an amatsonish maternity home when she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The department was emphatically emphatically embroidered by black extrapolates.
The third special maternity home is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was about to get pregnant.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Mano Leloup wanted the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths purely of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine brought together the six tough truth behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every symphony starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the previous season you were living in top designers, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with them.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuing to travel and can also take a year so that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can't travel along with you, loneliness can be inextricably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's only one kind of legality.
Agent New York may ask you to drop the pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
The designs and designers work together all the time, while operating as a support network.
When the fashions end, the difference is bad.
The models want this sector to be able to offer it, but they are so pale that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
The models also want to be their own person.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You were modeling last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks where designers will reveal their model for next year.
Roope Salminen, who moved into the style, presents the most unknown Abitant Musicist in the movie
Roope Salminen presents an Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band, in a film based on early years.
In 1991, Lautala established Apulanta with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me because I'm about to 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm going to present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it's just good that I'm just teaching her playing style from video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play a role.
The punk engineers come with a man naturally.
The stars, the stars in the punk section, I'm sure many people saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main performers of the beautiful film Tukka Temose was announced today.
A nuclear force known to the public by the band is yet to be presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumple Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, a singer from Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo basist Tuukka from Temoa Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his future plague last night when he mysteriously told him in Snapchat to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published in Instagram yesterday a picture of the new one he has had to carry out for the film.
Roope, who was previously seen in the figs and jaws, has driven his face to silopous, and dyed his brown hair to black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been wondering in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you at all?
There is no need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist, Fernando Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be helped to protect, for example, not to allow them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the sense of and distress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard about the refugees on TV news, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parents think he is afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of him, even if he'd be harassing himself and scaring himself.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also experience safety.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them about this if they think about it.
The fact is, all people in the world are not doing well.
The parents, together with the children, can wonder how our family views this.
In the end, however, do we feel that the world is a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model on how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “You need to teach your child to help the weaker.
At the end of your powers?
But you can still be a good parent to your child
Hard to control the blood-stamping Pallosalamaa
Perttu Pohjola got to sneak the Apila Pallosalama into the middle of the attack.
It only reduced the profits and the second seasons until at the end of July in Tampere, a collapse occurred.
Because the slave was just in the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a safe deposit from the vet for a while.
The explanation for the step-by-step was made clear in the alphabet.
The horse had a sore throat infection.
The disease was not the easiest way out of the world, but it required two courses of medicine to suffocate it.
As Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light motion, Pohjola says that he was welcome to the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku at the record time, after another SE plant Taruntull.
Apila Pallosalama was very pressured from the hive when it could have been run normally for just a few weeks.
Those things at the end of the little bending of attention were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that proper competition made the Ori sharp.
The horse must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have been even better off.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous.
After not enjoying it, it could have been a fat guy without the sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been dissatisfied by such a mystery that the opponents have been wonderful.
At the speed of action, the competitors are not able to reach Pallosalama, who can even get rid of warm-blooded rides.
There's a mirror run in Vermo's wishes at the North Pole.
However, the different thing is how Apila Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard to get out of here at the time of the departure, and it might be under the boom of the departure car and that kind of thing.
I hope the Ori would be more calm now than Turun's leaving.
Apilan Pallosalama is also able to come out of the bow while he is in order, and we will go out to win it, Coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of the bad iPhone software.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Perhaps in the future, Apple intends to remove some of its own iPhone phones, says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Vinks come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became forced on iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems on the top.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work permanently together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it, because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area went down to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices slowed down the decline in energy.
In this way, Eurostat revised the estimates of 0.2% a few weeks ago, slightly downwards.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimates for basic inflation were 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU over the whole 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU harmonised price index.
The inflation of the euro area continues to be very far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the rise in prices of two per cent in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for this year for the euro area.
Next year, the rise will be up to 1.1%, and the central bank will predict its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next US recession will begin at its speeds in less than a year, but more definitely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed will start again for a long time to raise interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the deficit begins before the next recession.
Fed has indicated that he may have started interest purchases this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
The next recession can therefore be hit at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate before.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they're responding to the blackmail of Fed's money, as they've done before.
Such conclusions have led to the conclusion of the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s London Market Research Strategys Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic research.
The Bank distributed more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market.
On the other hand, they present, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and markets have behaved in the past and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key variables of the economy and the financial markets, which are now the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates, and what might be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a mucher position to endure the increase in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recovery may not be a year.
Fed's monetary policy and its officials have been determined by the leaders over the last summer and the beginning of the year, suggesting that time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first deposit for over nine years may be due this week.
The matter will be resolved within the middle week and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed Executive Board is meeting to decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
For the previous time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds’ governance rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular but at the same time a series of interest rates of a small 0,25 percentage points ended for Fed to raise his interest from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the US's most risky housing funding, and one year later the financial crisis was a worldwide judge day nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy abuses began more slowly than the previous Fed interest rates have typically been achieved.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and rougher than the 1930s.
Deutschen’s strategies have reinvigorated the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950, and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
They are making clear from the interest rates and their financial and financial impact since the 1950s.
At the earliest rate, less than a year has passed since the start of the recovery, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended in the course of the year or two since Fed's interest rates started.
Fed has now increased and in turn decreased his steering rate by a dozen cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
In some respects, each time has differed from others, and the reporting is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely that they will give rise to any certainty as to the impact of the following increases.
The strategies remind us, therefore, that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rate too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be indisputable in finding out even in decades of research.
But three things about the victims of the crisis and the causes of its destructive forces, I believe, are somewhat undisputedly clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks of the world considered their governance rates too low for too long.
They were sort of sorting on the Teknoculum's tracks, and at the same time they raised the next one.
2) In the course of the various parts of the financial and real economy, the amount of debt accumulated over the decades and, above all, too much debt increased even more by the overrun of central banks' monetary policy.
The largest debt-to-GDP ratio was born in the past.
3) In particular, debt financing, which was the most expensive in terms of financial finances, increased the number of shares in real estate, debt certificates and commodities in most financial market sectors in the past.
Even so, it is unlikely that it will be very harsh to argue that the financial markets that have risen to higher levels in case of increasingly complex debt defects were in rare dangerous and unstable situations when Fed and other central banks recently drove up interest rates.
As a result, the valuation curves imposed on the debt instruments did not last as long as after the interest purchases had started and the cost of debt financing had increased.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give a nuclear issue, for example, by mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy under way even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) The debt has not been insane for a long time, as it has been ten years ago, but now the debt money is, in fact, cheaper than it is to express.
Thus, the debt liability of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt ratio is much more severe than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued as the lowest and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial market and the key types of securities and assets have been reduced to the highest or never before the peak that was before the financial crisis.
And the strategies of Latin are not only on financial market warnings, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to the model it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but according to the pressures and risks of the financial markets, it is equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed will now start to tighten up his money supply.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards of the Societ General's strategy, the French bank, is not as strange as it can suddenly be.
He's been coaching the bank's international investors' clients for some time for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial blocks will break out, and soon it's time that Fedin will turn off the financial shocks with even greater QE coins.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at the HP Business Service Department, the company tells.
In November, HP is divided into HP Inc., which focuses on sales to Hewlett Packard Enterprises and consumers.
HP had the highest number of personnel in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been cut to 302000.
The company will account for the one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30000 employees.
The consumer side reductions remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to the economies of mauling to 60% of its employees in the countries of low cost in 2018.
The company already tells us that it has balanced its business so that none of its customers no longer account for more than 10 % of its operating income.
Another year, 65 per cent of the operating result was its three most important customers.

Top: Minister Berner has acted as a tax haven company in the government of the company
Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner (medium.) says Ylen has acted as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities are related to so-called tax planning.
It's about the Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the government by Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a declaration of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a distinction.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains occur within the agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the holdings of the Swedish Kährs company are managed.
Kährs is a park manufacturer who has been fused with the Finnish park manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs and Luxembourg.
According to Ylen, Kährs' ownership is carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-port ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxemburg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company had a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital income is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs’ capital fund Triton was already ready for ownership by the Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens up a corporate reception centre
Espoo Otamiem opens the first company-sponsored reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening.
The number of places can grow within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue University.
The activities will be maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly involved in the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy together agree on the Centre’s security arrangements.
The STKI prepares alternative work-life tightening packages
The STKI will prepare an alternative package for the blackmail of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to include other employees' centres of interest.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being given to Friday's demonstration of mind.
Alternative ways of reducing the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola pointed out the break-up of the organization’s administration for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) does not, however, have the readiness to negotiate.
STK's economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if part of it's a great zeal to have a conversation if there's a one-way relationship with a hundred.
Palola: A negotiation connection has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since it is time for the Government to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and to start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take any position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, according to Palola, the operation of Sunday supplements is a painful place for the STKT field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation in which it would carry out some of the blackmails.
According to the STK, the Palola does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP who held the case.
The employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life Package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, pay for overtime is halfd, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and snow is reduced.
The STK is stressed that the central organisations have called employees on the expression of mind, and the purpose has not been to strike.
The Plan Fjäder boasts
The agenda president, Mr Fjader, thanks the STTK for its notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STKI is now coming to the same lines with Akari, as the program has already described a longer alternative model for government proposals.
Fjander hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, the proposed president, hopes the SAK, led by Mr Lauri Lyly, to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STKT said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan informed me that it has long been preparing its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate a 5% competitive advantage for the government of the country as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been prepared all the time to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjander hopes that SAK will also come to the Open Line, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The draft Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
\"The same boat, the common coal, the tallcots, is playing the bingo in Sipile talking tonight.
Green Left of Tampere University
The green left of the University of Tampere for the night of Vivan bingokuponk.
Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation of Finland about the state of Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
When applying for the previous speech of the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave President Mauno Koivisto a new year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit the train operators' strike on television.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The talk of the Sipile has raised all day's criticism and assumptions about what I'm going to do.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Mr Arhinmäki, said that: “It could be said of the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, there's already been a private phone call.
Leadership is a dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judgments condemned that \"monarchist makeup: Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipila's dialogue: “A half a year of elections.
There's no record of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is it that's afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on by direct transmission by SAK President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyr Hähämämämäminen of the EC.
Top has been criticised for making Sipil's speech.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, the line in the news of Ismo Silvo Ylen, President of Yle's publications.
It's like Me at Tammel's time.
The speech has also brought about looseness.
The dinner that comes tonight is enjoyed in good time, the children are taken and put on their best.
My mom's gonna put on a nicer hole, and my dad's gonna make a tie to his neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be on TV before we're back at Tammello's, writing a bloggari Saku Timonen.
“Do the Prime Minister Sipil also speak of why the Finnish Government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding in its capitals, which are making mercy laws for other tax collector friends, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has the rest of its money.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It's been published on Facebook by the other bingon.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the debt and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens complete at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the deportation of Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Archbishop, the Russian U.N. ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, Al-Assad would have been depreciated in style.
However, the Western countries did not stick to the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a two-centre debate, listed three plans: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad had to have a phone call immediately and the abandonment of Al-Assad had to be carried out in a slow manner.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said he was sitting down in Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has passed the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to the Ahtisaari, there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of Ahtisaari, but said that at that time the Al-Assad troops had already committed several mass murders and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is inconvenient with the words of the Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was at no time prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
As soon as the Ahtisaari is concerned, Tshurk spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to hold power on to some Al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow in our own actions
During the negotiations at the airport, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we do.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we've caused, says Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker’s facility in a stint in Turin
The Centre for Asylum Applicants, designed by the Government for Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in Turin.
The Centre would be set up in the building of the tornio building which is empty at the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought an appropriate place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsinki’s Words announced on Tuesday that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a subscription solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hõppinen (left) of the Toronto City Council, it is not true.
When the whole delegation was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting to the next Monday to decide on this matter, he would clarify it to the STT.
At the local meeting there were 36 delegates from 43.
The organisation centre was opposed to 13 mandates.
On that basis, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was quickly addressed.
It would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
The Sipil is still hoping for an alternative from the labour market to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (mainly).
However, it would be nice for the government to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations are able to agree on such an agreement.
In the Parliament, Sipil said to journalists that he had not been involved with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for substitute means for the blackmails of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä's view, it would be a way to make the holidays work, because it would be almost against all employees, unlike the Sunday cut by the government, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree on the cut-off of holiday money because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will give these views to Parliament next Wednesday about the pressure of working life in the form of a communication from the Government.
According to Sipil, organisations' proposals should be known before this.
This isn't even the final blanket.
The legislative work will then move, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become more difficult all the time.
Now's a good time.
I mean, it's not gonna take long to do such things if you want to, Sipilka.
The list published last week by the government has, among other things, to turn the end-of-life and Helsinki into unpaid days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, pay for overtime is halfd, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and snow is reduced.
The reforms are implemented as a mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the actions of the paid centres, there is a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have declared political recessions.
The Council of Tohmajärve approved the extension of the Mahlahall warehouse
The Council of Tohmajärve unanimously approved the extension of the stock of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, which is the mahlahall.
The assessment was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had originally been said.
A busy schedule is also heartbreaking.
It was also a little surprising that the volume need had not been known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 square meters was accepted in the investment programme, but the funding will not be decided in the context of the sub-annual report.
The agenda also discussed investment of €150,000 to €200 000, but the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at €300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the local government.
The municipality has no risk as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.).
A place for Karjala to speak in Joensuu
The city government has made a sharp contribution to bringing the street name villages of the herd languages to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right mind, the election of the livestock tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu is not declared the capital city of herds because there are no historical grounds and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the territory's identity.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern savoise.
After a new decision, the city centre will not be listed as street names.
The city of Joensuu, however, is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready to use the language of the herd, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-linguish municipality, it is also helpful to take an open approach to the use of herd tongue now that multiculturalism is still alive and is strongly changing in North Karelia.
The language of Karjala is still the specific features of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing in the region.
The ceasefire of train connections will cut the vitality of the county
The cuts in connection with trains strike the energy of the region with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economic and competitiveness of the region.
And it seems that there can be a place to live and work here at all, that the Mayor of Joensuu wonders.
He also highlights air traffic, which has continued to be on several occasions in meditation.
It is important for the whole region that we do not have the opportunity to deal with measures of state power, as is the case now.
We should look at the impact of these end-of-life links on employment, for example, Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport links will lead to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, what better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the principal of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that bad traffic links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Director of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, as transport links are weak in the opposite direction.
At present, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
They again account for about 10-20% of the Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct rail connection.
I got one of my fingers on Siu's wars.
The vision of the town government of Joensuu regarding the regional project Siu Sote is apparently unanimous, but there is one among my rings.
The City Government member, Pentti Centralsalo (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project to be abandoned at the Monday meeting, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Board approved a decision by the Mayor, Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give final opinion at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though it is less frequent than one train.
Change in passenger train between Kotka and Kouvola will be made next March.
One train partner is left out, but there is still five days to get from Kotvola to Kouvola and vice versa.
Deductions are due to State savings measures.
The purchase of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The most quiet routes will be completely terminated.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old climb from the climbing roof, who couldn't get off the roof of his own help.
The situation was born in Turin on Ketotie at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two - story wooden house in place, where there's no ladder on the roof at all.
It did not prevent a boy-to-man who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mass of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of you were sneezing from the scene and the passovers were alert to the rescue facility to help the bets safely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx's net turnover changes, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its last year's weak result. The transport sector had been weakened throughout the year's performance forecast due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increased cost of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for a holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between 10,40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May.
According to FactSitt's investigation, analysts predicted $10,84.
These increases have deteriorated on average, despite an increase in prices of 4.9%, and will enter into force on 4 January.
The company is still expecting income growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has been in a very expected economic situation in which it has undergone a very low level of activity, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The plans to hire seasonal workers were informed about the day after the competitor UPS announced that he planned to employ mainly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of six per cent.
The stock-specific result was $2.42, and then the 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research remained behind.
The turnover increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been testing the decline of international class one broadcasts, which is why the company's Express unit has been in place.
The strong growth in online trade has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
Over the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the cost of operating profit was increased by large-scale consignments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic taxes, while the return on freight business fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trade, FedEx's stock exchange rate had dropped to USD 3.85 or 2.5 per cent to USD 150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended at 11 % of the annual average and 17 % of the highest notional quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Heads of Central Bank of the United States of America will meet in the most expected meeting of the years. A number of people will stand on their diameter at the eight-metre Roman tree table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
The wall painting of the Central Bank, which is presenting the United States, is on the wall of the two-storey meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, along with his colleagues, of Janet L. Yellen, must put the State's financial interests ahead of all the other interests.
The central bank has a double order for Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, after the Great Change, the Bank’s management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the central bank is due to state whether the US economy is prepared to start the withdrawal of an unprecedented irresponsibility offered by short interest rates close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, recent financial market collapse can already be completed by careful central bank officials to hide the volatility by increasing the reference rate of federal taxes – even a percentage unit in the fourth quarter.
“External markets and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, the main author of the banking business Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is to give sufficient reason to wait, Mr Pegza will continue.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the central bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in Bloomberg's study made an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial market is expected to wait for the central bank and according to the key indicator there is only a 30% chance to rise.
If the central bank lifts its steering rate, the stock exchange rates can be calculated unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising another lift.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index fell to 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
“In the background of the collapse, there were expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week,” said Mr. John Lonski, the head of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
\"It would be a surprise if the central bank had raised interest at this stage,\" he said.
If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of those working on the financial market unemphasised.
Other experts, on the other hand, pointed out that the increase in interest rates could help to calm the financial market and eliminate the uncertainty of when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to grow to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening financial conditions and thus strengthening US recovery.
Yellen has said along the spring and early spring that he expected to raise interest rates this year – despite the liberals ’ need for economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates for full employment.
Wage income seems to be exacerbating
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual targets of 2 % of the central bank, the decision-makers of the Central Bank indicated that the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the oil prices.
“The economy can make up for higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take into account the harsh situation on the labour market,” Ian Shepherdson, the capitalist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
However , the financial market throughout the world did not fail last month when China devated its currency .
Down Jones's industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from May's record height and investors feared that China's recession would also affect global growth.
The market has been agitated this month, and Dow Jones has now down by nearly 10% of May's top readings.
The fall in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will be further influenced by the reflection of the increase in the steering interest rate.
“The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news has been done about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks,” said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, an older researcher and former official of the Central Bank.
Now he believes that the central bank is waiting for at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy, and there is little reliable information on the situation after recent Chinese economic developments,” said Oliner.
The global economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful entity in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint of this kind from President Ben S. Bernangen was that the central bank could narrow down the scope of its activities and make up the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring global developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
“The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science,” said Zachary Karabel, director of the Global Strategy of Envesnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker from the regional central bank of Richmond said this month that the central bank had previously over-balanced financial market movements that do not seem to have a link with the underlying pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the steering interest rate, as an example of decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
“The Asian economic crisis led to the decision at three meetings to lower the steering rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions for US economic growth were available, Lacker told.
One year later, the central bank cancelled the decision.
\"The central bank should only give priority to monetary stability in a major crisis, as in the economic collapse of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
I don't even know what's going on in there, but he said, \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
“There is no point in fear of a rise in the shells due to the shock of the market, ” added the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability.

The Rio Grande Children's Association in Brazil promotes a decent diet for mammals
The Rio Grande Children's Association SPRS in Brazil has developed a blinding practice to teach lactating women the meaning of a decent diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breast-feeded with photos of unhealthy food.
The human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby receives all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie volume by about 500 kg.
According to the new study, additional changes to the diet should be made in addition to the addition of calorie.
The recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The most viewers in Seven Sunris, even though Nine is trying to get the lead on his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would go to Canberra for the morning program on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership elections, which, however, had little effect on Todd's audience figures.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital to Malcolm Turnbul's disengaged Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's creative morning program was sent from London, and special shipments of the program from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun are also sent from Dubai, New York, Nigara Falls.
The distance seemed to have no relevance to the Australian television viewers, since Sunrise had an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capital cities, and 339 000 viewers, on the other hand, were on average.
Today's viewers rose slightly to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but remained on last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been catching up on the distance to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today, there were 318 000 viewers, 330 000 in Sunris.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50 000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and today 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
This morning, the wind will have a greater impact on Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

According to the Final Trinity, Sam Wood really is the Boy Scout of Dreams – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of a dream bachelor.
The final choice of dreamer Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
There's no way that three remaining women will be whispering about who's got the last rose from the bachelor.
We were asking about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavos-Fellows' tunnels before one of the three was cut off.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed up until the finals of Thursday.
All three women said Wood was a perfect man. Women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considered him to be a suitable partner for themselves.
When a woman was asked who would be the best partner for Wood if the last rose hadn't hit her own spot, their answers could allow her to see who's taking her boyfriend's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy since the beginning.
After I arrived in the house, I noted that Sarah and Sam were very compatible. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program, Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah has feet in the country, and he is really having fun with the company, ” added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a creative couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she's a good partner and Sam Wood.
Mackay told me that he'd realized last week at the home-town date that Wood might be the right one.
When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race, and now I'm putting our relationship in full, Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if a man did not choose him, the woman answered with appreciation:
- I can't say, he said.
\"I like other girls as much. Snezana and Lana are even. \"
The dream bachelor on Ten's channel Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
The case has originally been published under the title “Sarah Sam Wood’s Selection”
Jarryd Hayne has several options for the NFL-ura launch
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayna's modified United States. A number of others were also interested in men after the recent year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have liked Hayyne's bench, as a man had a rugby-maa team in line. Hayne would've brought the flight kick back to the team on Tuesday, from Minnesota, to read 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed his trust in Hayne and gave the man a new chance to return the flight kick. The coach held the Hayyne game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the dresser after the game.
He didn't rob the incomes in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failure to catch up and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is about to be caught in the first quarter of the game played against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fan crew had been waiting for another man from NFL-debyyt.
Hayne left the field after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not imagine a worse start for his NFL career.
\"These things happen, and we need to move on,\" Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error with his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his bait in his own territory opened a place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still incredible for a young 27-year-old.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram, where he poses with fans and Australia's flag.

Four dead policemen shot at rubber bullets in Nepal
Four people were killed in South Nepal, the source of authority told me on Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people in a protest against the new constitution that the country claimed to be, and there was a four-year-old son among the victims.
On Tuesday night, violence occurred in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to Border Manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 protestors had met outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police were using tear gas and then they came into the air before they shot the rubber bags.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which, yes, can kill but which are generally considered to be an alternative to less destruction, were suddenly as deadly.
It was the most recent assembly of the weeks in the protests that continued in the south of Nepal, where according to the Madhesi tribe, the new counties based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
The protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are policemen, have died in violent midgets since 10 August,
four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the counties, a major step towards a new Constitution, but the subject is very sensitive to Nepal, where the administration has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been worked on since 2008, but the legislative process has accelerated since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandus this week, and the authorities say that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Arranian Centre: 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
From a wide range of 560 kilometres from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde Islands, 60% of the probability of developing tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours was announced by the United States National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Air Science Department, the Cape Verde and the Small Antillies are also located at a clear center of the base substance. It can also develop to 60% of the probability of becoming tropical cyclone during the next two days.
Google plans to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced that they will launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that help across Europe war and thousands of people who have fled poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign in his blog in a very personal way.
Instead of running the campaign, Google’s employee Rita Masoud started by sharing his own experiences. He was only seven years old when he escaped from Kabul with his family.
“We traveled in the dark train and on the bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
A number of families in similar situations, after the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe, urgently need help.
Gifts are given to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and UN refugee organisations.
Once donations have been collected from google.com/refugeerelief through $5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, thus reaching the total amount of 11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst in the second world war, and the situation is exacerbating, particularly in Syria's four-year civil war, which has led to more than four million people being fled from their homes this year.
The war must also be escaped from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly obese diabeteses may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, mild obese type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from muscle surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether you live with mildly overweight type 2 diabeteses after an operation of obesity longer than those receiving surgery.
\"It takes time to get the data on the mortality record,\" said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the meat surgery, who was working on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
A muscle surgery, i.e. a bariatric surgery, will reduce the stomach by different methods.
Scurricular procedures reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective treatment forms in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have included patients with a medical overweight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The index shall indicate the weight and length of the weight where the normal value is 18.5-24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweighted, and the weight index of more than 30 shows significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers in the hospital of the Taiwanese Min-Sheng from 2007 used the data collected in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, surgery of the stomach and hip surgery, treatment of type 2 diabetes with mildly fat.
After muscle surgery, the mean weight index decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The body mass index of those who received treatment without surgery was maintained in the sense of 29:
The total improvement in surgical diabetes was 36% and in part 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and partly by only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides, and severe LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
The investigators also followed haemoglobin levels of A1c in patients, reflecting the development of blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean decrease in haemoglobin to A1c was 9%.
In the treatment group, the value was maintained at approximately 8 %.
Haemoglobin-A1c is reported in the control of blood glucose levels. However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu noted that this did not reduce mortality in five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, weight loss was higher in the abdominal bypass control group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the decrease in the body mass index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%) respectively. In the safety surgery group, diabetes was also fully improved in the majority (46.9 % and 16.7%).
According to the Swedish study of the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, however, the surgery is bringing years for fat people.
In a Swedish study, the incidence of mortality was reduced by 29% in comparison to the conventional treatment group.
Although the new study did not identify a lower mortality, Blackstone argued that it was confirmed that persons with a weight index of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
“This is the most important discovery of the study, as it provides safe surgery in the lower index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease,” Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the index is 27-30.
“We wait too long for people to start to take the situation seriously, ” the researcher said.
“When genetic changes to the human body that expose fat and diabetes have arisen, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
\"All cannot come to Europe – Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said that it is a real solution to the current refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis with its visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama held its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
\"It is an impossible idea that everyone could come to Europe, the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their actions in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
\"The management of thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time we must consider long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,\" said the Dalai Lama.
At the end of the day, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The force has never solved problems, he added.
In talking about violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's activities in connection with the 11th September terrorist attacks and claimed that, in response to a terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the 11th September attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would be made through violence.
I know that his intended family was good, but he resorted to the means of force that had the unforgivable consequences, Dalai Lama said.
Hand-to-hand neck injuries in children four times per four years
According to Georgia’s toxicity centre, poisoning centres across the United States tell children aged almost four times less than 12 years of age about the presence of alcohol-rich handicrafts.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the hand-to-mouth cases reported to the poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
“These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children will have to go first,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink for manual purposes, part of them to impress their friends and parts of social media as promoted.
YouTube videos contain teenagers who drink disinfecting agent because of a cheap drunk.
Teines are told to mix alcohol with a disinfectable disinfectant to get even stronger.
Smaller children can attract the smell of hands.
Lappis doesn't think the substance is bad, Lopez said.
“A large part of attractive hand products is just scattered.
There are handicraft products of maize, grapes and orange which appeal to children.
The alcohol content of the substances is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small amount of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 channel Kansas City.
“No one would leave whiskey on children’s reach, but if they are often left with children, they will quickly receive a high volume of alcohol.
Six-year-old Nahaija Russell recently enjoyed four loras of manic scents at the school, and she was delivered for first aid.
“The volume of alcohol in the blood was 179, which is twice as high as the adult hop limit,” reports the girl’s doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Chris Ritchey Atlanta.
Nahaija sopered and couldn't walk when they brought him to first aid.
The doctors followed the girl’s condition at night in a separate paediatric hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking, Ritchey told me.
\"Your job was really scary,\" said Ortoria Scott, Nadia's mother, CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, not only that the hand should be transferred to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, part of the disinfectants are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Intario women died of handicrafts which contained toxic substances that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought that the active substance in the product was a deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, even though the latter has been reported as active substance in the product information.
According to the police report, three fourth grade students in the northern part of New York State were planning to kill a teacher in January to the night by putting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hands and denied it in the classroom.
The police considered that the past plan of the myth was meaningless and called for training in discipline activities.

The Dutch miss an old Scottish fighter – de Boer
The former Rangers average field player and the Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer have said that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has been overrun because they are no longer allowed to be followed by the two-competitions of Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, said: \"There are no more highlights of Celtic games in London.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved.
They don't just talk about Rangers' return.
We're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch need double fights between the teams.
Old Firm games have enormous tension, and they are also interested outside Scotland's borders.
I'm going to turn it around, Deila's gonna convince me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian credit assures us that the situation will change.
The lost company fell out of the Masters' league and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
\"Celtic's had some difficult episodes before, and we're gonna get up again,\" Dela said.
We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it is a source of anger or sorrow in many.
So do we, but we need to move on.
We urgently need support from Celtic's supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players.
It's really important that we be united.
Warburton's careful playoffs in January
Even though only a few weeks ago, Rangers Bomb Mark Warburton suggested that he be careful about the transfer points in January and says he wants to put the team at risk for unity.
“In January, playovers differ significantly from summer transfers, ” said Brentford’s ex coach.
\"The players associated with the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary competitions can cause more harm to the team than benefit from:
Michu, who is thinking of living at the Celtic goal
Swanseean's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic's playoff calls, which, on the other hand, has indicated that he is retired after the end of the Swans agreement.
The 29-year-old Michu has been a bullying ankle for years, and he failed to get a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA in Neilson's comments
Hearts led two to one when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team finally lost three to two. The defense red card was canceled later, which is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which is being revoked.
However, Neilson remains behind his words. “I did not question honesty, and I did not comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was snooped when he admitted that he had retributive songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“There was a local match, and the feeling was intense,” said the attacker. “I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the days of Celtic.
Tannadice's board believes Dundee United coaching board – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United leadership team can make the situation better, and that giving up on the field can no longer be allowed.
\"Stefen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight, Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes the Hamilton win with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to join Hamilton in front of his seventh successive oversight. At the same time, Aberdee took a five-point neck at the top of the Celtic serial table, which is to thank Adam Rooney's punishment for the first half of the world.
\"There is no cup or league team that could not have won such games,\" McInnes said.
Unemployment is unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July. The number of unemployed persons in the United Kingdom increased at the same time by 10 000.
According to the United Kingdom Statistical Centre for National Statistics, the unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent in Scotland when it was 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of employed persons in Scotland is 12 000 lower than three months earlier. The number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter. The average employment rate in the whole of the United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
David Mundell, Minister for Scotland, commented on recent figures: “The long-term plan of governance has established a basis for a strong economy.
Almost a year ago, Scotland made an historic decision to retain as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment decreased.
Why am I following a execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed in a poison jar.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
In January, I got a call from a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I answered the invitation yes.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought I could thus tell you the truth about the death penalty.
The angle of sight would be unique.
The suppliers will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and since applications are more than places, participants will be selected with a macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers from 12 to five.
The chosen ones are moderately followed by the execution.
I can't do it.
I sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip. I have created a man's personal relationship because we have spoken on the phone several times in months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in the capacity of both the Witness and the supplier, so I must not take the notebook and pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try and push the details into my mind.
I was accused on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
\"The idea is:
When you tell him the condemned story in a pleasant way, you get close to him.
I made a difference to the reporter.
The journalist admitted that he could have shaped his word more carefully, but still consider my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he tries to order, I wouldn't obey.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international supplier who can write about what has happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will contribute to the fight against death.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on this subject, you can listen to my podcast shipment.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this connection.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that man Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can't say I'm totally neutral.
A defenceless description can be read about other suppliers' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
He was lured from Canningjoe after a Russian police station.
The Canning Vale area officer remained dry by attracting a man up from Canningjoe.
The Perchisian man's escape company got into a low, ancient water, and a police officer who was a few meters away got a man back on the dry ground.
The Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
\"The man standing in the water told me that he wouldn't get out of the water and asked the police to get him into the water,\" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia did not attract the cover of the suit, so he chose a safer tactics – the negotiation.
\"In other words, an escape attempt makes a person feel comfortable,\" said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is an interesting example.
In 2006 the Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim across Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the pace inspired locals to plan Ben Cousins’ biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the operators tried to blindly, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody's accused of trying to get involved in a spying business last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the editors and the Racing Victoria integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tata was the last drop on Wednesday due to the recent race day treatment.
Moody told Fairfax Media that they've always tried to act for racing. Moody's been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample was found in a cobolt, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue in line with spying charges for a year and did not want to be influenced by bitter man’s activities.
I didn't intend to bring this up for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks down with a one-off, Moody said.
They know what really happened.
\"I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the status after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well.
I want the horses' owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach...
Moody dropped the bomb earlier at the Racing.com interview where she told me about the integrity department spying companies at her stable.
\"Fifty years ago, Terry Bailey, Daley Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at the stable for the purpose of spying on me.
They clearly believe I'm a cheater.
If so, they should be able to prove it, because I have not been caught from anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, the current President of the RVL, David Modone, and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry were aware of the operation then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal driver?
Should the RVL take real action and create responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-educators?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I should still be a training license and push me out of my duties, and there's no doubt that when I talk, I can think that way.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and that's sad.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their own decisions.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw.
The long-lasting investigation of Lidar's cobolts and the recent rejection situation led the coach to become frustrated in the end by threatening him to give up his license.
Mody is best known as the unbeatable master of Black Caviar. The man described the day-to-day management rule as ridiculous after the horse's legs had been set against the rules.
The office is against the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for it, Moody said.
“The person in my congregation mistakenly put clay on the horse’s foot.
We could've done the clay treatment last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race.
Moody can wait for three months of anti-competitive treatment against the rules that the organisers have begun to deal with.
- This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that the rules are needed, but this is going too far, Moody said.
Arrested at Cobram’s Colariplace
The police have arrested the biker this weekend, a man who ran away from the crash site.
The biker was taken on helicopters to Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he got serious injuries after the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car escaped from the scene and did not remain to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to expect the prosecution of the failure of the suspension and assistance obligations in the road accident and other traffic failures.
The 40-year-old bicycle from Cobram is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the opponents' button calls
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers his team to be criticizing the tactical game of NRL as two too popular actions.
According to Sydney Roosters Coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's button to the Gulf of Melbourne's hosts to win the race in Sydney on Friday night.
Mr. Wayne Bennett, coach of Brisbane Broncos, covered a very narrow reference to Storm's Broncos won in the Carcinthal at Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, and he called the game a model match, and said that the Queensland does not care more specifically about the button.
Bellamy was defending his own team's tactical game, and he said they were just focusing on the contact in their jacket.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that the two top team coach criticised his team. Bellamy sees this as an indication that the trainers are concerned about losing to Storm.
I remember Trent Robinson said nothing about the button when his team beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defence system or technology all year.
Trent's been on his mission for three years, and he may have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing is always coming up at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010.
\"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our game on Friday and considered their game interesting, Bellamy said.
“In 2010 St Georgea received a lot of criticisms about his boring game. Wayne said that the review would not stop him.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young people, fast middle-runrs.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010 now he wants everyone to play his style. Not all teams like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence from this when other trainers are so worried about meeting my team.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think to meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that there were more paints made in the game of Storm and Roosters than in the meeting of the Bronx and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20-8. Our game had more situations, but is it interesting football?
Or are the games and the lowlands interested in football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them.
Stormilla is a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit North Queensland Cowboys in Cronou Sharks on the next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man on the free 200 grand guarantee in the drug case
A man waiting for a life-long sentence in a 40-pound cocaine company in Queensland has been released from the 200 000-dollar guarantee.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by the police for finding a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo from Solay's ship, who had arrived through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the Coomera port in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maximovic and his partner in the boat port for the morning, and then surprised Coomera Roadhouse two days later.
Although Maximovic is possibly waiting for life-long drug possession for commercial purposes, a man's lawyer says there is no evidence that his client would have tried to get the whole batch, but he could have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape the country.
“Maximovic has clear links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, the judge said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
After reading the statements of the two persons, it is clear that $ 200 000 is a real financial burden for them, ” Judge Flanagan said.
“ However, it alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping, ” the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he would release his passports both in Australia and Serbia, daily reporting to the police and staying home from evening to morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get access to pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took her phone when she was sleeping and registered in an online communication service where she got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, after she woke up, she noticed that her phone was missing, and noticed it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she explained the content of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police, and once they found the computers on the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search warrants to apply for inappropriate children's tissue.
Hogg claimed that he tried to lead pedophiles on the Internet and that he was presenting a police officer to scare pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, said at the local courthouse at Dundee Sheriff Court: “What claimed to be dependent on people’s fear.
He admitted that he had made the graves on his computer, but claimed that he would act so as to present the police and thus be able to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me he had some disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When I found the messages on the phone, she shouted at her mother, crying, and crying,
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told me that she was using a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the prosecution of the possession of inappropriate child images last June 14 June. Hogg violated his freedom of bail this January 25th this year and left the right to be heard on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be entered in the sexual offender's register, as it can be considered that there were no significant sexual aspects of the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the declaration of judgment to October due to social back-up reports.
Mr Hogg was granted an exemption from guarantees in this case, but was held in prison on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is holding the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest African Head of State Mugabe fell on the steps leading to the talks height earlier this year.
Mugabe did not get hurt, but the video spread rapidly in social media.
Parliament's openings also shadowed the arguments made by the opposition party's legislators that they have received anonymous kill threats that warn them of bubbling Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the European People's Party dropped and interrupted the President's speech on the situation in the President's State on Tuesday.
Mr Innocent Gonese, the Bishop of the MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change), stated the text messages received by the seven opposition politicians calling for them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
“The video has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is “death, ” Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
Messages warn recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
According to the party bishop Morgan Tsvangirai, the party is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving operations for business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will distinguish between computer and printer business from the faster growing business equipment and service activities.
According to HP's information, the company's record of the arrangements is the one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion from the quarter of the quarter.
“The new restructuring enables a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” told Mr Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who will lead the company after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company in the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of transactions that help companies to move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over USD 50 billion, and according to its Commission, the company is providing unique integrated technology solutions for companies.
Bill Hewlett and Dave Paccard, founded in the 1930s, are now divided into two.
There are massive reorganizations in HP when traditional desktop computers are moving into mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP, which belongs to the largest technology companies in the United States, are the new move in the sector that believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the meet with Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything is going to be a rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field by December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four British national teams, and the man's history, knowing his participation in the European Championships, is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided to last season strongly after the more snoring, and it seemed to have returned to his former blade under a new season.
\"This kind of injury does not threaten the career,\" Wenger said.
- She didn't get well.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries.
Medically speaking, this may be the case, but as Wengerk said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also unobtrusive regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's ranks only 65 out of 157 leagues over the last five years.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that from the period 2007-2008, from six to eight teams have been the second most affected by the loss of money from the teams.
Wenger accepts the potential witches, but Arsenal believes that the improved statistics on injury in the last season will continue to evolve in a better direction.
“The return after injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time, when the body needs to be strengthened and the powers to apply for competition,” said Wenger.
Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope that he will balance his body. I believe in it, and it will allow his career to continue as he deserves.
The Arsenal will start his master's league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give it rest to those who need it, Wenger mentioned.
Although Arkenal is a clear favorite for the follow-up of the F Group, Maximir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible to the 41-game team.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by the country's strength on 3.2 Richter's scale.
The incident was a tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that, after last season, Arkenal has learned to bend to Monaco, and that he is also still motivated by a terrible desire to trust a team towards the European Championship.
We have a huge energy charge, Wenger said.
\"The Arsenal title has not yet been hit.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006, but with experience, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths of friends between men
The same description shines out of absence in other series. It is remarkable, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open is greater than ever and the suicide statistics for young men are at their highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 15 years in Great Britain.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is experiencing the problem by declaring for 2015 men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
It's the first idea of a challenge.
In the recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, healing opportunities for depressed patients are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the incidence of non-optimal patients was half-lifed if there were persons in their vicinity who had no mental health problems.
But everything is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered to be more important than relevant contacts.
As a result of the digitalisation of life, the need seems to be strong, fun and successful doubled even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status associated with permanent success, all of these take attention from internal values and from our natural personal growth and friendship.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money can't really buy happiness.
The fineness of the Fredie was that the series turned its priorities on its head.
No series of characters were defined according to the profession, but by personality. This appeared in friendship relations.
The series was said to be humorist Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also often saw Ross wanting Rachel. It was clear that men were able to identify this, even though they were not under arrest for being fully familiar.
A volunteer explained this to me: “When I hear people who are depressed and who think about suicide, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to do good is strong. People are easily considered weak if they talk about their problems.
“Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
A series of small moments of friendship between men was highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from outside at a desperate moment, but long-term support is provided from close proximity to friends and families.
In honor of the Comedy Central FriendsFest, the sets have been raised to live. So if you're taking part in the event this weekend, it's worth bringing friends to the coffee at Central Perki.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never know how important a friendship relationship can get out of it.
Comedy Central is sending the entire Fredit series – all 236 episodes – for #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates a goal with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Masters' league debut and helped PSG to hit the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started his work in the league of the Masters by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French masters immediately in hand. PSG however str several goal places before they finally could add to his leadership: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The section A also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG does not only seek a follow-up in the playoff games but also wants to improve its positions for a quarter of the remaining three matches.
Although the SPG picked up points, the match was not the perfect performance of the Laurent Blanc pilot team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal of the goal, and the man had been changed when he was opposed to his former home club, where he started his great career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the master’s league at home or at guests, so 2-0 win and good take will give us a good basis, even though we still have a destabilizing season,” Blanc said.
- This is good.
We were able to make a profit, and we were able to do so, but it's a shame that we couldn't do one or two more paintings.
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he got hurt. The team had to settle for 2-2 in the weekend against the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shadow of four minutes.
Last month, Manchester United, a Argentinian machine moved from PSG to line, was named as a PSG tracker, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe, and he proved to be worthy of praise for the ball's Marco Verratt feed by Malmö's defense and then fired a precise hit on the back corner of the goal, along with Johan Wiland.
However, those waiting for the PSG to be crushed had to be disappointed.
Malmö dropped out on Celtic's playoffs, marched on the field nine international level players since the start. The five men's defense and the two attackers' team were difficult to win.
Nikola Djordjic's shot went a little past Kevin Trapp's goal in the back of the game for 34 minutes. The team did not attack very actively.
On the other hand, the PSG was in vain to feed and weak finishes, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five destinations only during the first half of the year, and at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick was feeding the paint to the wigs of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the feeding game. Ibrahimovic feeds Di Maria shoots a spin-off over Wiland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was born at the time of Cavan, thanks to the chorus, and the Danish who played through the hand shot the full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him with his left toe batterer at Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended in another goal, and only from Wiland's top defense of David Luiz's proximity to shooting at the launch had to be read, and the Ezequiel Lavez painting from the exchange bench was abandoned at the end of the years.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after acknowledging that PSG was in his own class.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
I don't think they're enough.
A hat for the couple.
This was their final match.

White House confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
The White House, published on Tuesday, confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping is travelling to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September. It is a counter-responsive visit from President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions between the Heads of State and the President, Michelle Obama, the President of the United States, organises dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan for the honor of the state visit.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping enables the expansion of cooperation between the United States and China in the areas of global, regional and bilateral topics that are of interest to both parties.
